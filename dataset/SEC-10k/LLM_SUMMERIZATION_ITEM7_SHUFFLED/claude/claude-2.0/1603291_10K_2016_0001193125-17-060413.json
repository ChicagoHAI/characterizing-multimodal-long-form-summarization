Risk Factors.\nThe Companies' forward-looking statements are based on beliefs and assumptions using information available at the time the statements are made. The Companies caution the reader not to place undue reliance on their forward-looking statements because the assumptions, beliefs, expectations and projections about future events may, and often do, differ materially from actual results. The Companies undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect developments occurring after the statement is made.\nACCOUNTING MATTERS\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nDominion has identified the following accounting policies, including certain inherent estimates, that as a result of the judgments, uncertainties, uniqueness and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved, could result in material changes to its financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different assumptions. Dominion has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these policies with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors.\nACCOUNTING FOR REGULATED OPERATIONS\nThe accounting for Dominion's regulated electric and gas operations differs from the accounting for nonregulated operations in that Dominion is required to reflect the effect of rate regulation in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For regulated businesses subject to federal or state cost-of-service rate regulation, regulatory practices that assign costs to accounting periods may differ from accounting methods generally applied by nonregulated companies. When it is probable that regulators will permit the recovery of current costs through future rates charged to customers, these costs that otherwise would be expensed by nonregulated companies are deferred as regulatory assets. Likewise, regulatory liabilities are recognized when it is probable that regulators will require customer refunds through future rates or when revenue is collected from customers for expenditures that have yet to be incurred. Generally, regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into income over the period authorized by the regulator.\nDominion evaluates whether or not recovery of its regulatory assets through future rates is probable and makes various assumptions in its analysis. The expectations of future recovery are generally based on orders issued by regulatory commissions, legislation or historical experience, as well as discussions with applicable regulatory authorities and legal counsel. If recovery of a regulatory asset is determined to be less than probable, it will be written off in the period such assessment is made. See Notes 12 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS\nDominion recognizes liabilities for the expected cost of retiring tangible long-lived assets for which a legal obligation exists and the ARO can be reasonably estimated. These AROs are recognized at fair value as incurred and are capitalized as part of the cost of the related long-lived assets. In the absence of quoted market prices, Dominion estimates the fair value of its AROs using present value techniques, in which it makes various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, credit-adjusted risk free rates and cost escalation rates. The impact on measurements of new AROs or remeasurements of existing AROs, using different cost escalation rates in the future, may be significant. When Dominion revises any assumptions used to calculate the fair value of existing AROs, it adjusts the carrying amount of both the ARO liability and the related long-lived asset for assets that are in service; for assets that have ceased operations, Dominion adjusts the carrying amount of the ARO liability with such changes recognized in income. Dominion accretes the ARO liability to reflect the passage of time. In 2016, Dominion recorded an increase in AROs of $449 million primarily related to future ash pond and landfill closure costs at certain utility generation facilities and the Dominion Questar Combination. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nIn 2016, 2015 and 2014, Dominion recognized $104 million, $93 million and $81 million, respectively, of accretion, and expects to recognize $117 million in 2017. Dominion records accretion and depreciation associated with utility nuclear decommissioning AROs and regulated pipeline replacement\nTable 173: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>41 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nAROs as an adjustment to the regulatory liabilities related to these items.\nA significant portion of Dominion's AROs relates to the future decommissioning of its merchant and utility nuclear facilities. These nuclear decommissioning AROs are reported in the Dominion Generation segment. At December 31, 2016, Dominion's nuclear decommissioning AROs totaled $1.5 billion, representing approximately 60% of its total AROs. Based on their significance, the following discussion of critical assumptions inherent in determining the fair value of AROs relates to those associated with Dominion's nuclear decommissioning obligations.\nDominion obtains from third-party specialists periodic site-specific base year cost studies in order to estimate the nature, cost and timing of planned decommissioning activities for its nuclear plants. These cost studies are based on relevant information available at the time they are performed; however, estimates of future cash flows for extended periods of time are by nature highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. In addition, Dominion's cost estimates include cost escalation rates that are applied to the base year costs. Dominion determines cost escalation rates, which represent projected cost increases over time due to both general inflation and increases in the cost of specific decommissioning activities, for each nuclear facility. The selection of these cost escalation rates is dependent on subjective factors which are considered to be critical assumptions.\nINCOME TAXES\nJudgment and the use of estimates are required in developing the provision for income taxes and reporting of tax-related assets and liabilities. The interpretation of tax laws involves uncertainty, since tax authorities may interpret the laws differently. Ultimate resolution of income tax matters may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income and cash flows, and adjustments to tax-related assets and liabilities could be material.\nGiven the uncertainty and judgment involved in the determination and filing of income taxes, there are standards for recognition and measurement in financial statements of positions taken or expected to be taken by an entity in its income tax returns. Positions taken by an entity in its income tax returns that are recognized in the financial statements must satisfy a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, assuming that the position will be examined by tax authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information. At December 31, 2016, Dominion had $64 million of unrecognized tax benefits. Changes in these unrecognized tax benefits may result from remeasurement of amounts expected to be realized, settlements with tax authorities and expiration of statutes of limitations.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded representing future effects on income taxes for temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. Dominion evaluates quarterly the probability of realizing deferred tax assets by considering current and historical financial results, expectations for future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income or successfully implement tax planning strategies may affect the realization of deferred tax assets. Dominion establishes a valuation allowance when it is more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be\nrealized. At December 31, 2016, Dominion had established $135 million of valuation allowances.\nACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE\nDominion uses derivative contracts such as physical and financial forwards, futures, swaps, options and FTRs to manage commodity, interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks of its business operations. Derivative contracts, with certain exceptions, are reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Accounting requirements for derivatives and related hedging activities are complex and may be subject to further clarification by standard-setting bodies. The majority of investments held in Dominion's nuclear decommissioning and rabbi trusts and pension and other postretirement funds are also subject to fair value accounting. See Notes 6 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these fair value measurements.\nFair value is based on actively-quoted market prices, if available. In the absence of actively-quoted market prices, management seeks indicative price information from external sources, including broker quotes and industry publications. When evaluating pricing information provided by brokers and other pricing services, Dominion considers whether the broker is willing and able to trade at the quoted price, if the broker quotes are based on an active market or an inactive market and the extent to which brokers are utilizing a particular model if pricing is not readily available. If pricing information from external sources is not available, or if Dominion believes that observable pricing information is not indicative of fair value, judgment is required to develop the estimates of fair value. In those cases, Dominion must estimate prices based on available historical and near-term future price information and use of statistical methods, including regression analysis, that reflect its market assumptions.\nDominion maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.\nUSE OF ESTIMATES IN GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING\nAs of December 31, 2016, Dominion reported $6.4 billion of goodwill in its Consolidated Balance Sheet. A significant portion resulted from the acquisition of the former CNG in 2000 and the Dominion Questar Combination in 2016.\nIn April of each year, Dominion tests its goodwill for potential impairment, and performs additional tests more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change in the interim that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The 2016, 2015 and 2014 annual tests and any interim tests did not result in the recognition of any goodwill impairment.\nIn general, Dominion estimates the fair value of its reporting units by using a combination of discounted cash flows and other valuation techniques that use multiples of earnings for peer group companies and analyses of recent business combinations involving peer group companies. Fair value estimates are dependent on subjective factors such as Dominion's estimate of future cash flows, the selection of appropriate discount and growth rates, and the selection of peer group companies and recent transactions. These underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time; subsequent modifications, particularly changes in\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>42 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\ndiscount rates or growth rates inherent in Dominion's estimates of future cash flows, could result in a future impairment of goodwill. Although Dominion has consistently applied the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates that underlie the fair value calculations, such as estimates of future cash flows, and based those estimates on relevant information available at the time, such cash flow estimates are highly uncertain by nature and may vary significantly from actual results. If the estimates of future cash flows used in the most recent tests had been 10% lower, the resulting fair values would have still been greater than the carrying values of each of those reporting units tested, indicating that no impairment was present.\nSee Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nUSE OF ESTIMATES IN LONG-LIVED ASSET IMPAIRMENT TESTING\nImpairment testing for an individual or group of long-lived assets or for intangible assets with definite lives is required when circumstances indicate those assets may be impaired. When an asset's carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered impaired to the extent that the asset's fair value is less than its carrying amount. Performing an impairment test on long-lived assets involves judgment in areas such as identifying if circumstances indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets, and developing the undiscounted and discounted estimated future cash flows (used to estimate fair value in the absence of market-based value) associated with the asset, including probability weighting such cash flows to reflect expectations about possible variations in their amounts or timing, expectations about operating the long-lived assets and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. When determining whether an asset or asset group has been impaired, management groups assets at the lowest level that has identifiable cash flows. Although cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. For example, estimates of future cash flows would contemplate factors which may change over time, such as the expected use of the asset, including future production and sales levels, expected fluctuations of prices of commodities sold and consumed and expected proceeds from dispositions. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of impairments related to certain long-lived assets.\nEMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\nDominion sponsors noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for eligible active employees, retirees and qualifying dependents. The projected costs of providing benefits under these plans are dependent, in part, on historical information such as employee demographics, the level of contributions made to the plans and earnings on plan assets. Assumptions about the future, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates applied to benefit obligations, mortality rates and the anticipated rate of increase in healthcare costs and participant compensation, also have a significant impact on employee benefit costs. The impact of changes in these factors, as well as differences between Dominion's\nassumptions and actual experience, is generally recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the remaining average service period of plan participants, rather than immediately.\nThe expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates and mortality rates are critical assumptions. Dominion determines the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets for pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans by using a combination of:\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Expected inflation and risk-free interest rate assumptions; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Historical return analysis to determine long term historic returns as well as historic risk premiums for various asset classes; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Expected future risk premiums, asset volatilities and correlations; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Forecasts of an independent investment advisor; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Forward-looking return expectations derived from the yield on long-term bonds and the expected long-term returns of major stock market indices; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Investment allocation of plan assets. The strategic target asset allocation for Dominion's pension funds is 28% U.S. equity, 18% non-U.S. equity, 35% fixed income, 3% real estate and 16% other alternative investments, such as private equity investments. </td> </tr>\n</table> Strategic investment policies are established for Dominion's prefunded benefit plans based upon periodic asset/liability studies. Factors considered in setting the investment policy include those mentioned above such as employee demographics, liability growth rates, future discount rates, the funded status of the plans and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Deviations from the plans' strategic allocation are a function of Dominion's assessments regarding short-term risk and reward opportunities in the capital markets and/or short-term market movements which result in the plans' actual asset allocations varying from the strategic target asset allocations. Through periodic rebalancing, actual allocations are brought back in line with the target. Future asset/liability studies will focus on strategies to further reduce pension and other postretirement plan risk, while still achieving attractive levels of returns.\nDominion develops assumptions, which are then compared to the forecasts of an independent investment advisor to ensure reasonableness. An internal committee selects the final assumptions. Dominion calculated its pension cost using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption of 8.75% for 2016, 2015 and 2014. For 2017, the expected long-term rate of return for pension cost assumption is 8.75%. Dominion calculated its other postretirement benefit cost using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption of 8.50% for 2016, 2015 and 2014. For 2017, the expected long-term rate of return for other postretirement benefit cost assumption is 8.50%. The rate used in calculating other postretirement benefit cost is lower than the rate used in calculating pension cost because of differences in the relative amounts of various types of investments held as plan assets.\nDominion determines discount rates from analyses of AA/Aa rated bonds with cash flows matching the expected payments to be made under its plans. The discount rates used to calculate pension cost and other postretirement benefit cost ranged from 2.87% to 4.99% for pension plans and 3.56% to 4.94% for other postretirement benefit plans in 2016, were 4.40% in 2015,\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>43 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nranged from 5.20% to 5.30% for pension plans and 4.20% to 5.10% for other postretirement benefit plans in 2014. Dominion selected a discount rate ranging from 3.31% to 4.50% for pension plans and ranging from 3.92% to 4.47% for other postretirement benefit plans for determining its December 31, 2016 projected benefit obligations.\nDominion establishes the healthcare cost trend rate assumption based on analyses of various factors including the specific provisions of its medical plans, actual cost trends experienced and projected, and demographics of plan participants. Dominion's healthcare cost trend rate assumption as of December 31, 2016 was 7.00% and is expected to gradually decrease to 5.00% by 2021 and continue at that rate for years thereafter.\nMortality rates are developed from actual and projected plan experience for postretirement benefit plans. Dominion's actuary conducts an experience study periodically as part of the process to select its best estimate of mortality. Dominion considers both standard mortality tables and improvement factors as well as the plans' actual experience when selecting a best estimate. During 2016, Dominion conducted a new experience study as scheduled and, as a result, updated its mortality assumptions.\nThe following table illustrates the effect on cost of changing the critical actuarial assumptions previously discussed, while holding all other assumptions constant:\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase in Net Periodic Cost </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change in\nActuarial\nAssumption\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Pension\nBenefits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Other\nPostretirement\nBenefits\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(millions, except percentages) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discount rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.25 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.25 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Healthcare cost trend rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> % </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> In addition to the effects on cost, at December 31, 2016, a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase Dominion's projected pension benefit obligation by $287 million and its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $43 million, while a 1.00% increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would increase its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $152 million.\nSee Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on Dominion's employee benefit plans.\nNew Accounting Standards\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting standards.\nDominion\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nPresented below is a summary of Dominion's consolidated results:\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(millions, except EPS) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income attributable to Dominion\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,123 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>224 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,899 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,310 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted EPS\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.44 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.96 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.24 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Overview\nVS. 2015\nNet income attributable to Dominion increased 12%, primarily due to higher renewable energy investment tax credits and the new PJM capacity performance market effective June 2016. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in gains from agreements to convey shale development rights underneath several natural gas storage fields and charges related to future ash pond and landfill closure costs at certain utility generation facilities.\n2015 VS. 2014\nNet income attributable to Dominion increased 45%, primarily due to the absence of charges associated with Virginia legislation enacted in April 2014 relating to the development of a third nuclear unit located at North Anna and offshore wind facilities, the absence of losses related to the repositioning of Dominion's producer services business in the first quarter of 2014, and the absence of charges related to Dominion's Liability Management Exercise.

The goals of this strategy are to provide EPS growth, a growing dividend and to maintain a stable credit profile. Dominion expects 80% to 90% of earnings from its primary operating segments to come from regulated and long-term contracted businesses.\nDominion's 2017 net income is expected to remain substantially consistent on a per share basis as compared to 2016.\nDominion's 2017 results are expected to be positively impacted by the following:\nTable 232: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Decreased charges related to future ash pond and landfill closure costs at certain utility generation facilities; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 233: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>The inclusion of operations acquired from Dominion Questar for the entire year; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 234: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Decreased transaction and transition costs associated with the Dominion Questar Combination; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 235: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Growth in weather-normalized electric utility sales of approximately 1%; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 236: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Construction and operation of growth projects in electric utility operations and associated rate adjustment clause revenue; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 237: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Construction and operation of growth projects in gas transmission and distribution. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDominion's 2017 results are expected to be negatively impacted by the following:\nTable 238: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Lower power prices and an additional planned refueling outage at Millstone; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 239: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Decreased Cove Point import contract revenues; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 240: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>An increase in depreciation, depletion, and amortization; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 241: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>A higher effective tax rate, driven primarily by a decrease in investment tax credits; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 242: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Share dilution. </td> </tr>\n</table> Additionally, in 2017, Dominion expects to focus on meeting new and developing environmental requirements, including making investments in utility-scale solar generation, particularly in Virginia. In 2018, Dominion is expected to experience an increase in net income on a per share basis as compared to 2017 primarily due to the Liquefaction Project being in service for the full year.\nTable 243: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>46 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSegment results include the impact of intersegment revenues and expenses, which may result in intersegment profit or loss.

Short-term cash requirements not met by cash provided by operations are generally satisfied with proceeds from short-term borrowings. Long-term cash needs are met through issuances of debt and/or equity securities.\nAt December 31, 2016, Dominion had $2.3 billion of unused capacity under its credit facilities. See additional discussion below under Credit Facilities and Short-Term Debt.\nA summary of Dominion's cash flows is presented below:\nTable 308: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>607 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>318 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>316 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows provided by (used in):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,127 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,475 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,439 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,703 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,503 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,181 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,230 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,317 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,744 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(346 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>289 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents at end of year\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>261 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>607 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>318 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Operating Cash Flows\nNet cash provided by Dominion's operating activities decreased $348 million, primarily due to higher operations and maintenance expenses, derivative activities, and increased payments for income taxes and interest. The decrease was partially offset with the benefit from the new PJM capacity performance market and higher deferred fuel cost recoveries and revenues from rate adjustment clauses in its Virginia jurisdiction.\nDominion believes that its operations provide a stable source of cash flow to contribute to planned levels of capital expenditures and maintain or grow the dividend on common shares. In December 2016, Dominion's Board of Directors established an annual dividend rate for 2017 of $3.02 per share of common stock, a 7.9% increase over the 2016 rate. Dividends are subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. In January 2017, Dominion's Board of Directors declared dividends payable in March 2017 of 75.5 cents per share of common stock.\nDominion's operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that may negatively impact the timing or amounts of operating cash flows, and which are discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nCREDIT RISK\nDominion's exposure to potential concentrations of credit risk results primarily from its energy marketing and price risk management activities. Presented below is a summary of Dominion's credit exposure as of December 31, 2016 for these activities. Gross credit exposure for each counterparty is calculated as outstanding receivables plus any unrealized on- or off-balance sheet exposure, taking into account contractual netting rights.\nTable 309: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Gross\nCredit\nExposure </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Credit\nCollateral </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Net\nCredit\nExposure </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment grade(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-investment grade(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> No external ratings:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Internally rated-investment grade(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Internally rated-non-investment grade(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>98 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>98 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 310: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td>Designations as investment grade are based upon minimum credit ratings assigned by Moody's and Standard & Poor's.

As discussed in Credit Ratings, Dominion's ability to borrow funds or issue securities and the return demanded by investors are affected by credit ratings. In addition, the raising of external capital is subject to certain regulatory requirements, including registration with the SEC for certain issuances.\nDominion currently meets the definition of a well-known seasoned issuer under SEC rules governing the registration, communications and offering processes under the Securities Act of 1933. The rules provide for a streamlined shelf registration process to provide registrants with timely access to capital. This allows Dominion to use automatic shelf registration statements to register any offering of securities, other than those for exchange offers or business combination transactions.\nNet cash provided by Dominion's financing activities increased $3.9 billion, primarily reflecting higher net debt issuances and higher issuances of common stock and Dominion Midstream common and convertible preferred units in connection with the Dominion Questar Combination.\nTable 314: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>51 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nLIABILITY MANAGEMENT\nDuring 2014, Dominion elected to redeem certain debt and preferred securities prior to their stated maturities. Proceeds from the issuance of lower-cost senior and enhanced junior subordinated notes were used to fund the redemption payments. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for descriptions of these redemptions.\nFrom time to time, Dominion may reduce its outstanding debt and level of interest expense through redemption of debt securities prior to maturity and repurchases in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, through tender offers or otherwise.\nCREDIT FACILITIES AND SHORT-TERM DEBT\nDominion uses short-term debt to fund working capital requirements and as a bridge to long-term debt financings. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly during the course of the year, depending upon the timing and amount of cash requirements not satisfied by cash from operations. In January 2016, Dominion expanded its short-term funding resources through a $1.0 billion increase to one of its joint revolving credit facility limits. In addition, Dominion utilizes cash and letters of credit to fund collateral requirements. Collateral requirements are impacted by commodity prices, hedging levels, Dominion's credit ratings and the credit quality of its counterparties.\nIn connection with commodity hedging activities, Dominion is required to provide collateral to counterparties under some circumstances. Under certain collateral arrangements, Dominion may satisfy these requirements by electing to either deposit cash, post letters of credit or, in some cases, utilize other forms of security. From time to time, Dominion may vary the form of collateral provided to counterparties after weighing the costs and benefits of various factors associated with the different forms of collateral. These factors include short-term borrowing and short-term investment rates, the spread over these short-term rates at which Dominion can issue commercial paper, balance sheet impacts, the costs and fees of alternative collateral postings with these and other counterparties and overall liquidity management objectives.\nDominion's commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding, as well as capacity available under credit facilities, were as follows:\nTable 315: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 31, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> Facility\nLimit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Outstanding\nCommercial\nPaper\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Outstanding\nLetters of\nCredit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Facility\nCapacity\nAvailable\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Joint revolving credit facility(1)(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,155 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,845 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Joint revolving credit facility(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>415 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,155 </td> <td>(3) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>85 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,260 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 316: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td>In May 2016, the maturity dates for these facilities were extended from April 2019 to April 2020.

In December 2015, Dominion issued an additional $200 million of the variable rate short-term notes that matured in May 2016. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.\nIn February 2016, Dominion purchased and cancelled $100 million of the variable rate short-term notes that would have otherwise matured in May 2016 using the proceeds from the February 2016 issuance of senior notes that mature in 2018.\nIn September 2016, Dominion borrowed $1.2 billion under a term loan agreement that bore interest at a variable rate. The net proceeds were used to finance the Dominion Questar Combination. In December 2016, the loan was repaid with cash received from Dominion Midstream in connection with the contribution of Questar Pipeline. The loan would have otherwise matured in September 2017. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nLONG-TERM DEBT\nDuring 2016, Dominion issued the following long-term public debt:\nTable 319: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Type </td> <td> </td> <td>Principal </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Maturity </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.60 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Remarketable subordinated notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>700 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Remarketable subordinated notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>700 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2024 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.85 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2026 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.95 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2026 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.15 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2026 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2046 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Enhanced junior subordinated notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.25 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2076 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total notes issued\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> During 2016, Dominion also issued the following long-term private debt:\nTable 320: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>In February 2016, Dominion issued $500 million of 2.125% senior notes in a private placement.

These shares may either be newly issued or purchased on the open market with proceeds contributed to these plans. In January 2014, Dominion began purchasing its common stock on the open market for these plans. In April 2014, Dominion began issuing new common shares for these direct stock purchase plans.\nDuring 2016, Dominion issued 4.2 million shares of common stock totaling $314 million through employee savings plans, direct stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plans and other employee and director benefit plans. Dominion received cash proceeds of $295 million from the issuance of 4.0 million of such shares through Dominion Direct\u00ae and employee savings plans.\nIn both April 2016 and July 2016, Dominion issued 8.5 million shares under the related stock purchase contract entered into as part of Dominion's 2013 Equity Units and received $1.1 billion of total proceeds. Additionally, Dominion completed a market issuance of equity in April 2016 of 10.2 million shares and received proceeds of $756 million through a registered underwritten public offering. A portion of the net proceeds was used to finance the Dominion Questar Combination. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nDuring 2017, Dominion plans to issue shares for employee savings plans, direct stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plans and stock purchase contracts. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of common stock to be issued by Dominion for stock purchase contracts.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016, Dominion Midstream received $482 million of proceeds from the issuance of common units and $490 million of proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred units. The net proceeds were primarily used to finance a portion of the acquisition of Questar Pipeline from Dominion. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nREPURCHASE OF COMMON STOCK\nDominion did not repurchase any shares in 2016 and does not plan to repurchase shares during 2017, except for shares tendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations on vested restricted stock, which does not count against its stock repurchase authorization.\nPURCHASE OF DOMINION MIDSTREAM UNITS\nIn September 2015, Dominion initiated a program to purchase from the market up to $50 million of common units representing limited partner interests in Dominion Midstream, which expired in September 2016. Dominion purchased approximately 658,000 common units for $17 million and 887,000 common units for $25 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nACQUISITION OF DOMINION QUESTAR\nIn accordance with the terms of the Dominion Questar Combination, at closing, each share of issued and outstanding Dominion Questar common stock was converted into the right to receive $25.00 per share in cash. The total consideration was $4.4 billion based on 175.5 million shares of Dominion Questar outstanding at closing. Dominion also acquired Dominion Questar's outstanding debt of approximately $1.5 billion. Dominion financed the Dominion Questar Combination through the: (1) August 2016 issuance of $1.4 billion of 2016 Equity Units, (2) August\nTable 331: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>53 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\n2016 issuance of $1.3 billion of senior notes, (3) September 2016 borrowing of $1.2 billion under a term loan agreement, which was repaid with cash received from Dominion Midstream in connection with the contribution of Questar Pipeline and (4) $500 million of the proceeds from the April 2016 issuance of common stock.\nCredit Ratings\nCredit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Dominion believes that its current credit ratings provide sufficient access to the capital markets. However, disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to Dominion may affect its ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors. Dominion's credit ratings affect its liquidity, cost of borrowing under credit facilities and collateral posting requirements under commodity contracts, as well as the rates at which it is able to offer its debt securities.\nBoth quantitative (financial strength) and qualitative (business or operating characteristics) factors are considered by the credit rating agencies in establishing an individual company's credit rating. Credit ratings should be evaluated independently and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. The credit ratings for Dominion are affected by its financial profile, mix of regulated and nonregulated businesses and respective cash flows, changes in methodologies used by the rating agencies and event risk, if applicable, such as major acquisitions or dispositions.\nIn February 2016, Standard & Poor's lowered the following ratings for Dominion: issuer to BBB+ from A-, senior unsecured debt securities to BBB from BBB+ and junior/remarketable subordinated debt securities to BBB- from BBB. In addition, Standard & Poor's affirmed Dominion's commercial paper rating of A-2 and revised its outlook to stable from negative.\nIn March 2016, Fitch and Standard & Poor's changed the rating for Dominion's junior subordinated debt securities to account for its inability to defer interest payments on the remarketed 2013 Series A RSNs. Subsequently, junior subordinated debt securities without an interest deferral feature are rated one notch higher by Fitch and Standard & Poor's (BBB) than junior subordinated debt securities with an interest deferral feature (BBB-). See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the remarketed notes.\nCredit ratings as of February 23, 2017 follow:\nTable 332: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fitch </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Moody's </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Standard & Poor's </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dominion\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Issuer\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>BBB+ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Baa2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>BBB+ </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior unsecured debt securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>BBB+ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Baa2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>BBB </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Junior subordinated notes(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>BBB </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Baa3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>BBB </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Enhanced junior subordinated notes(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>BBB- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Baa3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>BBB- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Junior/ remarketable subordinated notes(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>BBB- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Baa3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>BBB- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial paper\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>F2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>P-2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>A-2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 333: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td>Securities do not have an interest deferral feature. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 334: <table> <tr> <td>(2) </td> <td>Securities have an interest deferral feature. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of February 23, 2017, Fitch, Moody's, and Standard & Poor's maintained a stable outlook for their respective ratings of Dominion.\nA downgrade in an individual company's credit rating does not necessarily restrict its ability to raise short-term and long-term financing as long as its credit rating remains investment grade, but it could result in an increase in the cost of borrowing. Dominion works closely with Fitch, Moody's and Standard & Poor's with the objective of achieving its targeted credit ratings. Dominion may find it necessary to modify its business plan to maintain or achieve appropriate credit ratings and such changes may adversely affect growth and EPS.\nDebt Covenants\nAs part of borrowing funds and issuing debt (both short-term and long-term) or preferred securities, Dominion must enter into enabling agreements. These agreements contain covenants that, in the event of default, could result in the acceleration of principal and interest payments; restrictions on distributions related to capital stock, including dividends, redemptions, repurchases, liquidation payments or guarantee payments; and in some cases, the termination of credit commitments unless a waiver of such requirements is agreed to by the lenders/security holders. These provisions are customary, with each agreement specifying which covenants apply. These provisions are not necessarily unique to Dominion.\nSome of the typical covenants include:\nTable 335: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>The timely payment of principal and interest; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 336: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Information requirements, including submitting financial reports filed with the SEC and information about changes in Dominion's credit ratings to lenders; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 337: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Performance obligations, audits/inspections, continuation of the basic nature of business, restrictions on certain matters related to merger or consolidation and restrictions on disposition of all or substantially all assets; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 338: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Compliance with collateral minimums or requirements related to mortgage bonds; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 339: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Limitations on liens. </td> </tr>\n</table> Dominion is required to pay annual commitment fees to maintain its credit facilities. In addition, Dominion's credit agreements contain various terms and conditions that could affect its ability to borrow under these facilities. They include maximum debt to total capital ratios and cross-default provisions.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the calculated total debt to total capital ratio, pursuant to the terms of the agreements, was as follows:\nTable 340: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Company </td> <td> </td> <td>Maximum Allowed Ratio(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Actual Ratio(2) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dominion\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 341: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td>Pursuant to a waiver received in April 2016 and in connection with the closing of the Dominion Questar Combination, the 65% maximum debt to total capital ratio in Dominion's credit agreements has, with respect to Dominion only, been temporarily increased to 70% until the end of the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2017. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 342: <table> <tr> <td>(2) </td> <td>Indebtedness as defined by the bank agreements excludes certain junior subordinated and remarketable subordinated notes reflected as long-term debt as well as AOCI reflected as equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 343: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf Dominion or any of its material subsidiaries fails to make payment on various debt obligations in excess of $100 million, the lenders could require the defaulting company, if it is a borrower under Dominion's credit facilities, to accelerate its repayment of any outstanding borrowings and the lenders could terminate their commitments, if any, to lend funds to that company under the credit facilities. In addition, if the defaulting company is Virginia Power, Dominion's obligations to repay any outstanding borrowing under the credit facilities could also be accelerated and the lenders' commitments to Dominion could terminate.\nDominion executed RCCs in connection with its issuance of the following hybrid securities:\nTable 344: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>June 2006 hybrids; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 345: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>September 2006 hybrids; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 346: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>June 2009 hybrids. </td> </tr>\n</table> In October 2014, Dominion redeemed all of the June 2009 hybrids. The redemption was conducted in compliance with the RCC. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, including terms of the RCCs.\nAt December 31, 2016, the termination dates and covered debt under the RCCs associated with Dominion's hybrids were as follows:\nTable 347: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Hybrid </td> <td> </td> <td> RCC\nTermination\nDate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Designated Covered Debt\nUnder RCC\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> June 2006 hybrids\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6/30/2036 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>September 2006 hybrids </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> September 2006 hybrids\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9/30/2036 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>June 2006 hybrids </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Dominion monitors these debt covenants on a regular basis in order to ensure that events of default will not occur. As of December 31, 2016, there have been no events of default under Dominion's debt covenants.\nDividend Restrictions\nCertain agreements associated with Dominion's credit facilities contain restrictions on the ratio of debt to total capitalization. These limitations did not restrict Dominion's ability to pay dividends or receive dividends from its subsidiaries at December 31, 2016.\nSee Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of potential restrictions on dividend payments by Dominion in connection with the deferral of interest payments and contract adjustment payments on certain junior subordinated notes and equity units, initially in the form of corporate units, which information is incorporated herein by reference.\nFuture Cash Payments for Contractual Obligations and Planned Capital Expenditures\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nDominion is party to numerous contracts and arrangements obligating it to make cash payments in future years. These contracts include financing arrangements such as debt agreements and leases, as well as contracts for the purchase of goods and services and financial derivatives. Presented below is a table summarizing cash payments that may result from contracts to which Dominion is a party as of December 31, 2016. For purchase obligations and\nother liabilities, amounts are based upon contract terms, including fixed and minimum quantities to be purchased at fixed or market-based prices. Actual cash payments will be based upon actual quantities purchased and prices paid and will likely differ from amounts presented below. The table excludes all amounts classified as current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than current maturities of long-term debt, interest payable and certain derivative instruments. The majority of Dominion's current liabilities will be paid in cash in 2017.\nTable 348: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2018-\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2020-\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 and\nthereafter </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,711 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,666 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,888 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,927 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,192 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payments(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,339 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,349 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,902 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,596 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,186 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Leases(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>127 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>238 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>508 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations(4):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchased electric capacity for utility operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>149 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>153 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>400 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fuel commitments for utility operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,163 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>386 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,487 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,336 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fuel commitments for nonregulated operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>122 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>114 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>124 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>131 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>491 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pipeline transportation and storage\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>305 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>495 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,253 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,433 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other(5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>648 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>179 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>884 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other long-term liabilities(6):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other contractual obligations(7)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>188 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>317 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cash payments\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,723 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,434 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,920 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,670 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61,747 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 349: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td>Based on stated maturity dates rather than the earlier redemption dates that could be elected by instrument holders. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 350: <table> <tr> <td>(2) </td> <td>Includes interest payments over the terms of the debt and payments on related stock purchase contracts.

Dominion's planned expenditures are expected to include construction and expansion of electric generation and natural gas transmission and storage facilities, construction improvements and expansion of electric transmission and distribution assets, purchases of nuclear fuel, maintenance and the construction of the Liquefaction Project and Dominion's portion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline.\nTable 356: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>55 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nDominion expects to fund its capital expenditures with cash from operations and a combination of securities issuances and short-term borrowings. Planned capital expenditures include capital projects that are subject to approval by regulators and the Board of Directors.\nSee DVP, Dominion Generation and Dominion Energy-Properties in Item 1. Business for a discussion of Dominion's expansion plans.\nThese estimates are based on a capital expenditures plan reviewed and endorsed by Dominion's Board of Directors in late 2016 and are subject to continuing review and adjustment and actual capital expenditures may vary from these estimates. Dominion may also choose to postpone or cancel certain planned capital expenditures in order to mitigate the need for future debt financings and equity issuances.\nUse of Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nLEASING ARRANGEMENT\nIn July 2016, Dominion signed an agreement with a lessor to construct and lease a new corporate office property in Richmond, Virginia. The lessor is providing equity and has obtained financing commitments from debt investors, totaling $365 million, to fund the estimated project costs. The project is expected to be completed by mid-2019. Dominion has been appointed to act as the construction agent for the lessor, during which time Dominion will request cash draws from the lessor and debt investors to fund all project costs, which totaled $46 million as of December 31, 2016. If the project is terminated under certain events of default, Dominion could be required to pay up to 89.9% of the then funded amount. For specific full recourse events, Dominion could be required to pay up to 100% of the then funded amount.\nThe five-year lease term will commence once construction is substantially complete and the facility is able to be occupied. At the end of the initial lease term, Dominion can (i) extend the term of the lease for an additional five years, subject to the approval of the participants, at current market terms, (ii) purchase the property for an amount equal to the project costs or, (iii) subject to certain terms and conditions, sell the property to a third party using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the highest cash purchase price for the property. If the project is sold and the proceeds from the sale are insufficient to repay the investors for the project costs, Dominion may be required to make a payment to the lessor, up to 87% of project costs, for the difference between the project costs and sale proceeds.\nThe respective transactions have been structured so that Dominion is not considered the owner during construction for financial accounting purposes and, therefore, will not reflect the construction activity in its consolidated financial statements. The financial accounting treatment of the lease agreement will be impacted by the new accounting standard issued in February 2016. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Dominion will be considered the owner of the leased property for tax purposes, and as a result, will be entitled to tax deductions for depreciation and interest expense.\nGUARANTEES\nDominion primarily enters into guarantee arrangements on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries. These arrangements are not sub-\nject to the provisions of FASB guidance that dictate a guarantor's accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, which information is incorporated herein by reference.\nFUTURE ISSUES AND OTHER MATTERS\nSee Item 1. Business and Notes 13 and 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on various environmental, regulatory, legal and other matters that may impact future results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nEnvironmental Matters\nDominion is subject to costs resulting from a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect human health and the environment. These laws and regulations affect future planning and existing operations. They can result in increased capital, operating and other costs as a result of compliance, remediation, containment and monitoring obligations.\nENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND MONITORING EXPENDITURES\nDominion incurred $394 million, $298 million and $313 million of expenses (including accretion and depreciation) during 2016, 2015, and 2014 respectively, in connection with environmental protection and monitoring activities, including charges related to future ash pond and landfill closure costs, and expects these expenses to be approximately $190 million and $185 million in 2017 and 2018, respectively. In addition, capital expenditures related to environmental controls were $191 million, $94 million, and $101 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These expenditures are expected to be approximately $185 million and $115 million for 2017 and 2018, respectively.\nFUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS\nAir\nThe CAA is a comprehensive program utilizing a broad range of regulatory tools to protect and preserve the nation's air quality. At a minimum, delegated states are required to establish regulatory programs to address all requirements of the CAA. However, states may choose to develop regulatory programs that are more restrictive. Many of the Companies' facilities are subject to the CAA's permitting and other requirements.\nIn August 2015, the EPA issued final carbon standards for existing fossil fuel power plants. Known as the Clean Power Plan, the rule uses a set of measures for reducing emissions from existing sources that includes efficiency improvements at coal plants, displacing coal-fired generation with increased utilization of natural gas combined cycle units and expanding renewable resources. The new rule requires states to impose standards of performance limits for existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units or equivalent statewide intensity-based or mass-based CO2 binding goals or limits. States are required to submit final plans identifying how they will comply with the rule by September 2018. The EPA also issued a proposed federal plan and model trading rule that states can adopt or that would be put in place if, in response to the final guidelines, a state either does not submit a state plan or its plan is not approved by the EPA. Virginia Power's most recent integrated resources plan filed in April 2016 includes four\nTable 357: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>56 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nalternative plans that represent plausible compliance strategies with the rule as proposed, and which include additional coal unit retirements and additional low or zero-carbon resources. The final rule has been challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. In February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay of the Clean Power Plan until the disposition of the petitions challenging the rule now before the Court of Appeals, and, if such petitions are filed in the future, before the U.S. Supreme Court. Dominion does not know whether these legal challenges will impact the submittal deadlines for the state implementation plans. In June 2016, the Governor of Virginia signed an executive order directing the Virginia Natural Resources Secretary to convene a workgroup charged with recommending concrete steps to reduce carbon pollution which include the Clean Power Plan as an option. Unless the rule survives the court challenges and until the state plans are developed and the EPA approves the plans, Dominion cannot predict the potential financial statement impacts but believes the potential expenditures to comply could be material.\nIn December 2012, the EPA issued a final rule that set a more stringent annual air quality standard for fine particulate matter. The EPA issued final attainment/nonattainment designations in January 2015. Until states develop their implementation plans, Dominion cannot determine whether or how facilities located in areas designated nonattainment for the standard will be impacted, but does not expect such impacts to be material.\nThe EPA has finalized rules establishing a new 1-hour NAAQS for NO2 and a new 1-hour NAAQS for SO2, which could require additional NOX and SO2 controls in certain areas where Dominion operates. Until the states have developed implementation plans for these standards, the impact on Dominion's facilities that emit NOX and SO2 is uncertain. Additionally, the impact of permit limits for implementing NAAQS on Dominion's facilities is uncertain at this time.\nClimate Change\nIn December 2015, the Paris Agreement was formally adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The accord establishes a universal framework for addressing GHG emissions involving actions by all nations through the concept of nationally determined contributions in which each nation defines the GHG commitment it can make and sets in place a process for increasing those commitments every five years. It also contains a global goal of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to aim to reach global peaking of GHG emissions as soon as possible.\nA key element of the initial U.S. nationally determined contributions of achieving a 26% to 28% reduction below 2005 levels by 2025 is the implementation of the Clean Power Plan, which establishes interim emission reduction targets for fossil fuel-fired electric generating units over the period 2022 through 2029 with final targets to be achieved by 2030. The EPA estimates that the Clean Power Plan will result in a nationwide reduction in CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units of 32% from 2005 levels by 2030.\nIn March 2016, as part of its Climate Action Plan, the EPA began development of regulations for reducing methane emissions\nfrom existing sources in the oil and natural gas sectors. In November 2016, the EPA issued an Information Collection Request to collect information on existing sources upstream of local distribution companies in this sector. Depending on the results of this Information Collection Request, the EPA may propose new regulations on existing sources. Dominion cannot currently estimate the potential impacts on results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows related to this matter.\nPHMSA Regulation\nThe most recent reauthorization of PHMSA included new provisions on historical records research, maximum-allowed operating pressure validation, use of automated or remote-controlled valves on new or replaced lines, increased civil penalties and evaluation of expanding integrity management beyond high-consequence areas. PHMSA has not yet issued new rulemaking on most of these items.\nLegal Matters\nCollective Bargaining Agreement\nIn April 2016, the labor contract between Dominion and Local 69 expired. In August 2016, the parties reached a tentative agreement for a new labor contract, however, the agreement was not submitted to members of Local 69 for approval. In September 2016, following a temporary lock out of union members, Local 69 agreed to not strike at DTI and Hope at least through April 1, 2017. In exchange, DTI and Hope agreed to recall the union members to work and not lock them out during that period. Contract negotiations resumed in October 2016 and are continuing. Local 69 represents approximately 760 DTI employees in West Virginia, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Virginia and approximately 150 Hope employees in West Virginia.\nDodd-Frank Act\nThe Dodd-Frank Act was enacted into law in July 2010 in an effort to improve regulation of financial markets. The CEA, as amended by Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, requires certain over-the counter derivatives, or swaps, to be cleared through a derivatives clearing organization and, if the swap is subject to a clearing requirement, to be executed on a designated contract market or swap execution facility. Non-financial entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk, often referred to as end users, may elect the end-user exception to the CEA's clearing requirements. Dominion has elected to exempt its swaps from the CEA's clearing requirements. The CFTC may continue to adopt final rules and implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act through its ongoing rulemaking process, including rules regarding margin requirements for non-cleared swaps. If, as a result of the rulemaking process, Dominion's derivative activities are not exempted from clearing, exchange trading or margin requirements, it could be subject to higher costs due to decreased market liquidity or increased margin payments. In addition, Dominion's swap dealer counterparties may attempt to pass-through additional trading costs in connection with the implementation of, and compliance with, Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. Due to the evolving rulemaking process, Dominion is currently unable to assess the potential impact of the Dodd-Frank Act's derivative-related provisions on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nTable 358: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>57 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued", "item_7_truncated": "2015 VS. 2014\nTable 264: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,218 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>131 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,087 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>229 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>858 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSegment results include the impact of intersegment revenues and expenses, which may result in intersegment profit or loss.

The CEA, as amended by Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, requires certain over-the counter derivatives, or swaps, to be cleared through a derivatives clearing organization and, if the swap is subject to a clearing requirement, to be executed on a designated contract market or swap execution facility. Non-financial entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk, often referred to as end users, may elect the end-user exception to the CEA's clearing requirements. Dominion has elected to exempt its swaps from the CEA's clearing requirements. The CFTC may continue to adopt final rules and implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act through its ongoing rulemaking process, including rules regarding margin requirements for non-cleared swaps. If, as a result of the rulemaking process, Dominion's derivative activities are not exempted from clearing, exchange trading or margin requirements, it could be subject to higher costs due to decreased market liquidity or increased margin payments. In addition, Dominion's swap dealer counterparties may attempt to pass-through additional trading costs in connection with the implementation of, and compliance with, Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. Due to the evolving rulemaking process, Dominion is currently unable to assess the potential impact of the Dodd-Frank Act's derivative-related provisions on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nTable 286: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

An internal committee selects the final assumptions. Dominion calculated its pension cost using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption of 8.75% for 2016, 2015 and 2014. For 2017, the expected long-term rate of return for pension cost assumption is 8.75%.

For 2017, the expected long-term rate of return for other postretirement benefit cost assumption is 8.50%.

Presented below is a summary of Dominion's credit exposure as of December 31, 2016 for these activities. Gross credit exposure for each counterparty is calculated as outstanding receivables plus any unrealized on- or off-balance sheet exposure, taking into account contractual netting rights.\n \u2022 Expected future risk premiums, asset volatilities and correlations; \n \u2022 Cost of environmental compliance, including those costs related to climate change; \nDominion's strategy is to continue focusing on its regulated businesses while maintaining upside potential in well-positioned nonregulated businesses. The goals of this strategy are to provide EPS growth, a growing dividend and to maintain a stable credit profile. Dominion expects 80% to 90% of earnings from its primary operating segments to come from regulated and long-term contracted businesses.\n \u2022 An increase in gains from agreements to convey shale development rights underneath several natural gas storage fields ($63 million); \n 56 \nA significant portion of Dominion's AROs relates to the future decommissioning of its merchant and utility nuclear facilities. These nuclear decommissioning AROs are reported in the Dominion Generation segment. At December 31, 2016, Dominion's nuclear decommissioning AROs totaled $1.5 billion, representing approximately 60% of its total AROs. Based on their significance, the following discussion of critical assumptions inherent in determining the fair value of AROs relates to those associated with Dominion's nuclear decommissioning obligations.\n An analysis of Dominion Gas' results of operations follows:\nDominion currently meets the definition of a well-known seasoned issuer under SEC rules governing the registration, communications and offering processes under the Securities Act of 1933. The rules provide for a streamlined shelf registration process to provide registrants with timely access to capital. This allows Dominion to use automatic shelf registration statements to register any offering of securities, other than those for exchange offers or business combination transactions.\n \u2022 A $50 million increase in storm damage and service restoration costs, including $23 million for Hurricane Matthew; \n \u2022 A $21 million increase in services performed for Atlantic Coast Pipeline; and \nDominion primarily enters into guarantee arrangements on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries. These arrangements are not sub-\n In addition to the effects on cost, at December 31, 2016, a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase Dominion's projected pension benefit obligation by $287 million and its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $43 million, while a 1.00% increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would increase its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $152 million.\nVS. 2015\nranged from 5.20% to 5.30% for pension plans and 4.20% to 5.10% for other postretirement benefit plans in 2014. Dominion selected a discount rate ranging from 3.31% to 4.50% for pension plans and ranging from 3.92% to 4.47% for other postretirement benefit plans for determining its December 31, 2016 projected benefit obligations.\n \u2022 A $34 million decrease from regulated natural gas transmission operations, primarily reflecting: \n\n 49 \n \u2022 A $17 million decrease in NGL activities, due to decreased prices ($15 million) and volumes ($2 million); partially offset by \n \u2022 Risks of operating businesses in regulated industries that are subject to changing regulatory structures; \n \u2022 A $9 million decrease in other revenue primarily due to a decrease in pooling and metering activities ($3 million), a decrease in Blue Racer management fees ($3 million) and a decrease in gathering activities ($2 million); partially offset by \n \u2022 The timely payment of principal and interest; \n\nDominion recognizes liabilities for the expected cost of retiring tangible long-lived assets for which a legal obligation exists and the ARO can be reasonably estimated. These AROs are recognized at fair value as incurred and are capitalized as part of the cost of the related long-lived assets. In the absence of quoted market prices, Dominion estimates the fair value of its AROs using present value techniques, in which it makes various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, credit-adjusted risk free rates and cost escalation rates. The impact on measurements of new AROs or remeasurements of existing AROs, using different cost escalation rates in the future, may be significant. When Dominion revises any assumptions used to calculate the fair value of existing AROs, it adjusts the carrying amount of both the ARO liability and the related long-lived asset for assets that are in service; for assets that have ceased operations, Dominion adjusts the carrying amount of the ARO liability with such changes recognized in income. Dominion accretes the ARO liability to reflect the passage of time. In 2016, Dominion recorded an increase in AROs of $449 million primarily related to future ash pond and landfill closure costs at certain utility generation facilities and the Dominion Questar Combination. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nPresented below are selected amounts related to Virginia Power's results of operations:\nFrom time to time, Dominion may reduce its outstanding debt and level of interest expense through redemption of debt securities prior to maturity and repurchases in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, through tender offers or otherwise.\n 53 \nThe Companies' forward-looking statements are based on beliefs and assumptions using information available at the time the statements are made. The Companies caution the reader not to place undue reliance on their forward-looking statements because the assumptions, beliefs, expectations and projections about future events may, and often do, differ materially from actual results. The Companies undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect developments occurring after the statement is made.\nMortality rates are developed from actual and projected plan experience for postretirement benefit plans. Dominion's actuary conducts an experience study periodically as part of the process to select its best estimate of mortality. Dominion considers both standard mortality tables and improvement factors as well as the plans' actual experience when selecting a best estimate. During 2016, Dominion conducted a new experience study as scheduled and, as a result, updated its mortality assumptions.\nUSE OF ESTIMATES IN GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING\n \u2022 A $12 million decrease from regulated natural gas distribution operations, primarily reflecting: \n \u2022 Changes in demand for the Companies' services, including industrial, commercial and residential growth or decline in the Companies' service areas, changes in supplies of natural gas delivered to Dominion and Dominion Gas' pipeline and processing systems, failure to maintain or replace customer \nVIRGINIA POWER\n\nIn connection with commodity hedging activities, Dominion is required to provide collateral to counterparties under some circumstances. Under certain collateral arrangements, Dominion may satisfy these requirements by electing to either deposit cash, post letters of credit or, in some cases, utilize other forms of security. From time to time, Dominion may vary the form of collateral provided to counterparties after weighing the costs and benefits of various factors associated with the different forms of collateral. These factors include short-term borrowing and short-term investment rates, the spread over these short-term rates at which Dominion can issue commercial paper, balance sheet impacts, the costs and fees of alternative collateral postings with these and other counterparties and overall liquidity management objectives.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nThis report contains statements concerning the Companies' expectations, plans, objectives, future financial performance and other statements that are not historical facts. These statements are \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In most cases, the reader can identify these forward-looking statements by such words as \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cforecast,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201ccontinue,\u201d \u201ctarget\u201d or other similar words.\nThe expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates and mortality rates are critical assumptions. Dominion determines the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets for pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans by using a combination of:\n\nIn both April 2016 and July 2016, Dominion issued 8.5 million shares under the related stock purchase contract entered into as part of Dominion's 2013 Equity Units and received $1.1 billion of total proceeds. Additionally, Dominion completed a market issuance of equity in April 2016 of 10.2 million shares and received proceeds of $756 million through a registered underwritten public offering. A portion of the net proceeds was used to finance the Dominion Questar Combination. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\ninvested in Dominion's common stock. These shares may either be newly issued or purchased on the open market with proceeds contributed to these plans. In January 2014, Dominion began purchasing its common stock on the open market for these plans. In April 2014, Dominion began issuing new common shares for these direct stock purchase plans.\nInterest and related charges increased 29%, primarily due to higher interest expense resulting from the issuances of senior notes in November 2015 and the second quarter of 2016 ($28 million), partially offset by an increase in deferred rate adjustment clause interest expense ($7 million).\nSome of the typical covenants include:\n \u2022 Changes in technology, particularly with respect to new, developing or alternative sources of generation and smart grid technologies; \n \u2022 A $62 million decrease from NGL activities, primarily due to decreased prices; partially offset by \nNet revenue increased 1%, primarily reflecting:\nIn accordance with the terms of the Dominion Questar Combination, at closing, each share of issued and outstanding Dominion Questar common stock was converted into the right to receive $25.00 per share in cash. The total consideration was $4.4 billion based on 175.5 million shares of Dominion Questar outstanding at closing. Dominion also acquired Dominion Questar's outstanding debt of approximately $1.5 billion. Dominion financed the Dominion Questar Combination through the: (1) August 2016 issuance of $1.4 billion of 2016 Equity Units, (2) August\n (1) Pursuant to a waiver received in April 2016 and in connection with the closing of the Dominion Questar Combination, the 65% maximum debt to total capital ratio in Dominion's credit agreements has, with respect to Dominion only, been temporarily increased to 70% until the end of the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2017. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\n \u2022 Growth in weather-normalized electric utility sales of approximately 1%; \n (3) The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 15% of the total net credit exposure. \nDodd-Frank Act\n \u2022 Accounting Matters-Dominion \n \u2022 Investment allocation of plan assets. The strategic target asset allocation for Dominion's pension funds is 28% U.S. equity, 18% non-U.S. equity, 35% fixed income, 3% real estate and 16% other alternative investments, such as private equity investments.  Strategic investment policies are established for Dominion's prefunded benefit plans based upon periodic asset/liability studies. Factors considered in setting the investment policy include those mentioned above such as employee demographics, liability growth rates, future discount rates, the funded status of the plans and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Deviations from the plans' strategic allocation are a function of Dominion's assessments regarding short-term risk and reward opportunities in the capital markets and/or short-term market movements which result in the plans' actual asset allocations varying from the strategic target asset allocations. Through periodic rebalancing, actual allocations are brought back in line with the target. Future asset/liability studies will focus on strategies to further reduce pension and other postretirement plan risk, while still achieving attractive levels of returns.\nSee DVP, Dominion Generation and Dominion Energy-Properties in Item 1. Business for a discussion of Dominion's expansion plans.\nAt December 31, 2016, the termination dates and covered debt under the RCCs associated with Dominion's hybrids were as follows:\nBoth quantitative (financial strength) and qualitative (business or operating characteristics) factors are considered by the credit rating agencies in establishing an individual company's credit rating. Credit ratings should be evaluated independently and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. The credit ratings for Dominion are affected by its financial profile, mix of regulated and nonregulated businesses and respective cash flows, changes in methodologies used by the rating agencies and event risk, if applicable, such as major acquisitions or dispositions.\nNet revenue increased 10%, primarily reflecting:\n \u2022 An increase in sales to retail customers, primarily due to a net increase in cooling degree days ($38 million); and \n \u2022 Results of Operations \n \u2022 Changes in rating agency requirements or credit ratings and their effect on availability and cost of capital; \nDominion evaluates whether or not recovery of its regulatory assets through future rates is probable and makes various assumptions in its analysis. The expectations of future recovery are generally based on orders issued by regulatory commissions, legislation or historical experience, as well as discussions with applicable regulatory authorities and legal counsel. If recovery of a regulatory asset is determined to be less than probable, it will be written off in the period such assessment is made. See Notes 12 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nDominion Questar's revolving multi-year and 364-day credit facilities with limits of $500 million and $250 million, respectively, were terminated in October 2016.\n \u2022 The timing and execution of Dominion Midstream's growth strategy; \nIn February 2016, Standard & Poor's lowered the following ratings for Dominion: issuer to BBB+ from A-, senior unsecured debt securities to BBB from BBB+ and junior/remarketable subordinated debt securities to BBB- from BBB. In addition, Standard & Poor's affirmed Dominion's commercial paper rating of A-2 and revised its outlook to stable from negative.\nAir\n 44 \nPresented below is a summary of Virginia Power's consolidated results:\nOutlook\n \u2022 Performance obligations, audits/inspections, continuation of the basic nature of business, restrictions on certain matters related to merger or consolidation and restrictions on disposition of all or substantially all assets; \nACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE\n \u2022 A $148 million increase due to the Dominion Questar Combination, including $58 million of transaction and transition costs; \nDominion maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.\n \u2022 Forecasts of an independent investment advisor; \n \u2022 Organizational design initiative costs ($64 million); \nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting standards.\n \u2022 A $53 million increase in utility nuclear refueling outage costs primarily due to the amortization of outage costs that were previously deferred pursuant to Virginia legislation enacted in April 2014.  Other income decreased 27%, primarily reflecting lower tax recoveries associated with contributions in aid of construction.\nDepreciation and amortization increased 10% primarily due to various expansion projects placed into service.\nDVP\n \u2022 The inability to complete planned construction, conversion or expansion projects at all, or with the outcomes or within the terms and time frames initially anticipated; \n \u2022 Domestic terrorism and other threats to the Companies' physical and intangible assets, as well as threats to cybersecurity; \nThe accounting for Dominion's regulated electric and gas operations differs from the accounting for nonregulated operations in that Dominion is required to reflect the effect of rate regulation in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For regulated businesses subject to federal or state cost-of-service rate regulation, regulatory practices that assign costs to accounting periods may differ from accounting methods generally applied by nonregulated companies. When it is probable that regulators will permit the recovery of current costs through future rates charged to customers, these costs that otherwise would be expensed by nonregulated companies are deferred as regulatory assets. Likewise, regulatory liabilities are recognized when it is probable that regulators will require customer refunds through future rates or when revenue is collected from customers for expenditures that have yet to be incurred. Generally, regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into income over the period authorized by the regulator.\nIn April of each year, Dominion tests its goodwill for potential impairment, and performs additional tests more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change in the interim that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The 2016, 2015 and 2014 annual tests and any interim tests did not result in the recognition of any goodwill impairment.\n (2) In January 2016, this facility limit was increased from $4.0 billion to $5.0 billion. \nDominion's 2017 results are expected to be negatively impacted by the following:\nDominion sponsors noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for eligible active employees, retirees and qualifying dependents. The projected costs of providing benefits under these plans are dependent, in part, on historical information such as employee demographics, the level of contributions made to the plans and earnings on plan assets. Assumptions about the future, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates applied to benefit obligations, mortality rates and the anticipated rate of increase in healthcare costs and participant compensation, also have a significant impact on employee benefit costs. The impact of changes in these factors, as well as differences between Dominion's\nAROs as an adjustment to the regulatory liabilities related to these items.\nThese estimates are based on a capital expenditures plan reviewed and endorsed by Dominion's Board of Directors in late 2016 and are subject to continuing review and adjustment and actual capital expenditures may vary from these estimates. Dominion may also choose to postpone or cancel certain planned capital expenditures in order to mitigate the need for future debt financings and equity issuances.\n \u2022 Impacts of acquisitions, including the recently completed Dominion Questar Combination, divestitures, transfers of assets to joint ventures or Dominion Midstream, including the recently completed contribution of Questar Pipeline to Dominion Midstream, and retirements of assets based on asset portfolio reviews; \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nDominion uses derivative contracts such as physical and financial forwards, futures, swaps, options and FTRs to manage commodity, interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks of its business operations. Derivative contracts, with certain exceptions, are reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Accounting requirements for derivatives and related hedging activities are complex and may be subject to further clarification by standard-setting bodies. The majority of investments held in Dominion's nuclear decommissioning and rabbi trusts and pension and other postretirement funds are also subject to fair value accounting. See Notes 6 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these fair value measurements.\n \u2022 The impact of operational hazards, including adverse developments with respect to pipeline and plant safety or integrity, equipment loss, malfunction or failure, operator error, and other catastrophic events.  Additionally, other risks that could cause actual results to differ from predicted results are set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n \u2022 A $26 million decrease in bad debt expense at regulated natural gas distribution operations primarily related to low income assistance programs. These bad debt expenses are recovered through rates and do not impact net income.  Other income increased $10 million, primarily due to a gain on the sale of 0.65% of the noncontrolling partnership interest in Iroquois ($5 million) and an increase in AFUDC associated with rate-regulated projects ($5 million).\n \u2022 Share dilution.  Additionally, in 2017, Dominion expects to focus on meeting new and developing environmental requirements, including making investments in utility-scale solar generation, particularly in Virginia. In 2018, Dominion is expected to experience an increase in net income on a per share basis as compared to 2017 primarily due to the Liquefaction Project being in service for the full year.\n \u2022 In December 2016, SBL Holdco borrowed $405 million under a term loan agreement that bears interest at a variable rate. The term loan amortizes over an 18-year period and matures in December 2023. The debt is nonrecourse to Dominion and is secured by SBL Holdco's interest in certain merchant solar facilities. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.  During 2016, Dominion repaid $1.8 billion of short-term notes and repaid and repurchased $1.6 billion of long-term debt.\n \u2022 A $36 million decrease in gas transportation and storage activities, primarily due to decreased demand charges ($28 million), increased fuel costs ($13 million), contract rate changes ($11 million) and decreased revenue from gathering and extraction services ($8 million), partially offset by increased regulated gas sales ($16 million) and expansion projects placed in service ($9 million); and \nOther income increased 28%, primarily due to an increase in earnings from equity method investments ($55 million) and an increase in AFUDC associated with rate-regulated projects ($12 million), partially offset by lower realized gains (net of investment income) on nuclear decommissioning trust funds ($19 million).\nENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND MONITORING EXPENDITURES\n \u2022 An $85 million write-off of deferred fuel costs associated with Virginia legislation enacted in February 2015; \nCREDIT FACILITIES AND SHORT-TERM DEBT\nSHORT-TERM NOTES\n \u2022 Fluctuations in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates; \n \u2022 In December 2016, Dominion Midstream borrowed $300 million under a term loan agreement that matures in December 2019 and bears interest at a variable rate. The net proceeds were used to finance a portion of the acquisition of Questar Pipeline from Dominion. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. \nDominion is party to numerous contracts and arrangements obligating it to make cash payments in future years. These contracts include financing arrangements such as debt agreements and leases, as well as contracts for the purchase of goods and services and financial derivatives. Presented below is a table summarizing cash payments that may result from contracts to which Dominion is a party as of December 31, 2016. For purchase obligations and\nDominion's commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding, as well as capacity available under credit facilities, were as follows:\n2015 VS. 2014\n (1) Represents noncontrolling interest related to merchant solar partnerships.  2015 VS.\n \u2022 A $38 million increase from regulated natural gas distribution operations, primarily due to an increase in rate adjustment clause revenue related to low income assistance programs ($12 million), an increase in AMR and PIR program revenues ($24 million) and various expansion projects placed into service ($22 million); partially offset by a decrease in gathering revenues ($9 million); and \n (1) Period average.  Presented below, on an after-tax basis, are the key factors impacting DVP's net income contribution:\nNet income increased 27%, primarily due to the absence of charges associated with Virginia legislation enacted in April 2014 relating to the development of a third nuclear unit located at North Anna and offshore wind facilities.\nCONTENTS OF MD&A\n \u2022 An increase from rate adjustment clauses ($183 million); and \n 2016. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes and to repay short-term debt, including commercial paper. \nNet income attributable to Dominion increased 12%, primarily due to higher renewable energy investment tax credits and the new PJM capacity performance market effective June 2016. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in gains from agreements to convey shale development rights underneath several natural gas storage fields and charges related to future ash pond and landfill closure costs at certain utility generation facilities.\nMD&A discusses Dominion's results of operations and general financial condition and Virginia Power's and Dominion Gas' results of operations. MD&A should be read in conjunction with Item 1. Business and the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Virginia Power and Dominion Gas meet the conditions to file under the reduced disclosure format, and therefore have omitted certain sections of MD&A.\nNet revenue decreased 3%, primarily reflecting:\n \u2022 Competition in the development, construction and ownership of certain electric transmission facilities in Virginia Power's service territory in connection with FERC Order 1000; \n \u2022 The absence of charges associated with Virginia legislation enacted in April 2014 relating to the development of a third nuclear unit located at North Anna and offshore wind facilities ($370 million); \n \u2022 A $305 million increase due to the Dominion Questar Combination.  These increases were partially offset by:\nLEASING ARRANGEMENT\n \u2022 Difficulty in anticipating mitigation requirements associated with environmental and other regulatory approvals; \nINCOME TAXES\n \u2022 Risks associated with Virginia Power's membership and participation in PJM, including risks related to obligations created by the default of other participants; \nIn December 2015, the Paris Agreement was formally adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The accord establishes a universal framework for addressing GHG emissions involving actions by all nations through the concept of nationally determined contributions in which each nation defines the GHG commitment it can make and sets in place a process for increasing those commitments every five years. It also contains a global goal of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to aim to reach global peaking of GHG emissions as soon as possible.\nSEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nPURCHASE OF DOMINION MIDSTREAM UNITS\n (7) Includes interest rate and foreign currency swap agreements.  PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES\nFair value is based on actively-quoted market prices, if available. In the absence of actively-quoted market prices, management seeks indicative price information from external sources, including broker quotes and industry publications. When evaluating pricing information provided by brokers and other pricing services, Dominion considers whether the broker is willing and able to trade at the quoted price, if the broker quotes are based on an active market or an inactive market and the extent to which brokers are utilizing a particular model if pricing is not readily available. If pricing information from external sources is not available, or if Dominion believes that observable pricing information is not indicative of fair value, judgment is required to develop the estimates of fair value. In those cases, Dominion must estimate prices based on available historical and near-term future price information and use of statistical methods, including regression analysis, that reflect its market assumptions.\n 2015 VS. 2014\n \u2022 Receipt of approvals for, and timing of, closing dates for acquisitions and divestitures; \n \u2022 An $80 million increase in certain electric transmission-related expenditures.

Known as the Clean Power Plan, the rule uses a set of measures for reducing emissions from existing sources that includes efficiency improvements at coal plants, displacing coal-fired generation with increased utilization of natural gas combined cycle units and expanding renewable resources. The new rule requires states to impose standards of performance limits for existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units or equivalent statewide intensity-based or mass-based CO2 binding goals or limits. States are required to submit final plans identifying how they will comply with the rule by September 2018. The EPA also issued a proposed federal plan and model trading rule that states can adopt or that would be put in place if, in response to the final guidelines, a state either does not submit a state plan or its plan is not approved by the EPA.

Although Dominion has consistently applied the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates that underlie the fair value calculations, such as estimates of future cash flows, and based those estimates on relevant information available at the time, such cash flow estimates are highly uncertain by nature and may vary significantly from actual results. If the estimates of future cash flows used in the most recent tests had been 10% lower, the resulting fair values would have still been greater than the carrying values of each of those reporting units tested, indicating that no impairment was present.\nDominion maintains Dominion Direct\u00ae and a number of employee savings plans through which contributions may be\n \u2022 A $14 million decrease in gas transportation and storage activities, primarily due to decreased demand charges ($28 million), increased fuel costs ($13 million), contract rate changes ($11 million) and decreased revenue from gathering and extraction services ($8 million), partially offset by expansion projects placed in service ($18 million) and increased regulated gas sales ($20 million); and \n (1) Designations as investment grade are based upon minimum credit ratings assigned by Moody's and Standard & Poor's.

Proceeds from the issuance of lower-cost senior and enhanced junior subordinated notes were used to fund the redemption payments. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for descriptions of these redemptions.\nCredit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Dominion believes that its current credit ratings provide sufficient access to the capital markets. However, disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to Dominion may affect its ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors. Dominion's credit ratings affect its liquidity, cost of borrowing under credit facilities and collateral posting requirements under commodity contracts, as well as the rates at which it is able to offer its debt securities.\nThe CAA is a comprehensive program utilizing a broad range of regulatory tools to protect and preserve the nation's air quality. At a minimum, delegated states are required to establish regulatory programs to address all requirements of the CAA. However, states may choose to develop regulatory programs that are more restrictive. Many of the Companies' facilities are subject to the CAA's permitting and other requirements.\nSee Item 1. Business and Notes 13 and 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on various environmental, regulatory, legal and other matters that may impact future results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nIn September 2015, Dominion initiated a program to purchase from the market up to $50 million of common units representing limited partner interests in Dominion Midstream, which expired in September 2016. Dominion purchased approximately 658,000 common units for $17 million and 887,000 common units for $25 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n \u2022 In May 2016, Dominion Gas issued $150 million of private placement 3.8% senior notes that mature in 2031. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. In June 2016, Dominion Gas issued $250 million of private placement 2.875% senior notes that mature in 2023. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes and to repay short-term debt, including commercial paper. Also in June 2016, Dominion Gas issued \u0080 250 million of private placement 1.45% senior notes that mature in 2026. The notes were recorded at $280 million at issuance and included in long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at $263 million at December 31, \n (1) In May 2016, the maturity dates for these facilities were extended from April 2019 to April 2020. These credit facilities can be used to support bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper, as well as to support up to a combined $2.0 billion of letters of credit. \n \u2022 A $37 million increase in salaries, wages and benefits and general administrative expenses; and \nDebt Covenants\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded representing future effects on income taxes for temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. Dominion evaluates quarterly the probability of realizing deferred tax assets by considering current and historical financial results, expectations for future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income or successfully implement tax planning strategies may affect the realization of deferred tax assets.

These limitations did not restrict Dominion's ability to pay dividends or receive dividends from its subsidiaries at December 31, 2016.\n\n 51 \nIf Dominion or any of its material subsidiaries fails to make payment on various debt obligations in excess of $100 million, the lenders could require the defaulting company, if it is a borrower under Dominion's credit facilities, to accelerate its repayment of any outstanding borrowings and the lenders could terminate their commitments, if any, to lend funds to that company under the credit facilities. In addition, if the defaulting company is Virginia Power, Dominion's obligations to repay any outstanding borrowing under the credit facilities could also be accelerated and the lenders' commitments to Dominion could terminate.\n \u2022 Future Issues and Other Matters-Dominion \n2016 VS. 2015\nPresented below are operating statistics related to Dominion Generation's operations:\nIn March 2016, as part of its Climate Action Plan, the EPA began development of regulations for reducing methane emissions\n \u2022 Results of Operations \n \u2022 Changes to regulated electric rates collected by Virginia Power and regulated gas distribution, transportation and storage rates, including LNG storage, collected by Dominion and Dominion Gas; \n \u2022 A $12 million increase in other revenues, primarily due to an increase in services performed for Atlantic Coast Pipeline ($21 million), partially offset by decreased amortization of deferred revenue associated with conveyed shale development rights ($4 million); and \n \u2022 A decrease in capacity related expenses ($33 million); partially offset by \nDominion establishes the healthcare cost trend rate assumption based on analyses of various factors including the specific provisions of its medical plans, actual cost trends experienced and projected, and demographics of plan participants. Dominion's healthcare cost trend rate assumption as of December 31, 2016 was 7.00% and is expected to gradually decrease to 5.00% by 2021 and continue at that rate for years thereafter.\nDominion uses short-term debt to fund working capital requirements and as a bridge to long-term debt financings. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly during the course of the year, depending upon the timing and amount of cash requirements not satisfied by cash from operations. In January 2016, Dominion expanded its short-term funding resources through a $1.0 billion increase to one of its joint revolving credit facility limits. In addition, Dominion utilizes cash and letters of credit to fund collateral requirements. Collateral requirements are impacted by commodity prices, hedging levels, Dominion's credit ratings and the credit quality of its counterparties.\nGUARANTEES\nCorporate and Other includes specific items attributable to Dominion's primary operating segments that are not included in profit measures evaluated by executive management in assessing the segments' performance or in allocating resources. See Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of these items in more detail. Corporate and other also includes specific items attributable to the Corporate and Other segment. In 2016, this primarily included $53 million of after-tax transaction and transition costs associated with the Dominion Questar Combination. In 2014, this primarily included $174 million of after-tax charges associated with Dominion's Liability Management Exercise.\n2016 VS. 2015\n (1) Based on stated maturity dates rather than the earlier redemption dates that could be elected by instrument holders. \nDominion relies on capital markets as significant sources of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by cash provided by its operations. As discussed in Credit Ratings, Dominion's ability to borrow funds or issue securities and the return demanded by investors are affected by credit ratings. In addition, the raising of external capital is subject to certain regulatory requirements, including registration with the SEC for certain issuances.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the calculated total debt to total capital ratio, pursuant to the terms of the agreements, was as follows:\nDominion's planned capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $5.8 billion, $5.0 billion and $5.2 billion in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. Dominion's planned expenditures are expected to include construction and expansion of electric generation and natural gas transmission and storage facilities, construction improvements and expansion of electric transmission and distribution assets, purchases of nuclear fuel, maintenance and the construction of the Liquefaction Project and Dominion's portion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline.\nAnalysis of Consolidated Operations\n \u2022 A decrease in sales to customers due to the effect of changes in customer usage and other factors ($24 million); and \n \u2022 The absence of gains on the sale of assets to Blue Racer ($59 million); \n \u2022 An increase from rate adjustment clauses ($183 million); and \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\n \u2022 A $98 million increase in charges related to future ash pond and landfill closure costs at certain utility generation facilities; \nIn general, Dominion estimates the fair value of its reporting units by using a combination of discounted cash flows and other valuation techniques that use multiples of earnings for peer group companies and analyses of recent business combinations involving peer group companies. Fair value estimates are dependent on subjective factors such as Dominion's estimate of future cash flows, the selection of appropriate discount and growth rates, and the selection of peer group companies and recent transactions.

Risk Factors.\n 43 \nPresented below is a summary of Dominion Gas' consolidated results:\n \u2022 A $544 million increase from electric utility operations, primarily reflecting: \n \u2022 Changes in operating, maintenance and construction costs; \nThe Companies make forward-looking statements with full knowledge that risks and uncertainties exist that may cause actual results to differ materially from predicted results. Factors that may cause actual results to differ are often presented with the forward-looking statements themselves. Additionally, other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward-looking statement. These factors include but are not limited to:\n2015 VS. 2014\nREPURCHASE OF COMMON STOCK\nPresented below, on an after-tax basis, are the key factors impacting Dominion Energy's net income contribution:\nACQUISITION OF DOMINION QUESTAR\n\n An analysis of Virginia Power's results of operations follows:\n \u2022 Decreased charges related to future ash pond and landfill closure costs at certain utility generation facilities; \nDominion obtains from third-party specialists periodic site-specific base year cost studies in order to estimate the nature, cost and timing of planned decommissioning activities for its nuclear plants. These cost studies are based on relevant information available at the time they are performed; however, estimates of future cash flows for extended periods of time are by nature highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. In addition, Dominion's cost estimates include cost escalation rates that are applied to the base year costs. Dominion determines cost escalation rates, which represent projected cost increases over time due to both general inflation and increases in the cost of specific decommissioning activities, for each nuclear facility. The selection of these cost escalation rates is dependent on subjective factors which are considered to be critical assumptions.\n 41 \nEMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\nIn December 2012, the EPA issued a final rule that set a more stringent annual air quality standard for fine particulate matter. The EPA issued final attainment/nonattainment designations in January 2015. Until states develop their implementation plans, Dominion cannot determine whether or how facilities located in areas designated nonattainment for the standard will be impacted, but does not expect such impacts to be material.\n \u2022 Changes in rules for RTOs and ISOs in which Dominion and Virginia Power participate, including changes in rate designs, changes in FERC's interpretation of market rules and new and evolving capacity models; \nFinancing Cash Flows and Liquidity\nA downgrade in an individual company's credit rating does not necessarily restrict its ability to raise short-term and long-term financing as long as its credit rating remains investment grade, but it could result in an increase in the cost of borrowing. Dominion works closely with Fitch, Moody's and Standard & Poor's with the objective of achieving its targeted credit ratings. Dominion may find it necessary to modify its business plan to maintain or achieve appropriate credit ratings and such changes may adversely affect growth and EPS.\n \u2022 Segment Results of Operations \nfrom existing sources in the oil and natural gas sectors. In November 2016, the EPA issued an Information Collection Request to collect information on existing sources upstream of local distribution companies in this sector. Depending on the results of this Information Collection Request, the EPA may propose new regulations on existing sources. Dominion cannot currently estimate the potential impacts on results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows related to this matter.\nNet cash provided by Dominion's financing activities increased $3.9 billion, primarily reflecting higher net debt issuances and higher issuances of common stock and Dominion Midstream common and convertible preferred units in connection with the Dominion Questar Combination.\n (4) The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 16% of the total net credit exposure. \nNet income attributable to Dominion increased 45%, primarily due to the absence of charges associated with Virginia legislation enacted in April 2014 relating to the development of a third nuclear unit located at North Anna and offshore wind facilities, the absence of losses related to the repositioning of Dominion's producer services business in the first quarter of 2014, and the absence of charges related to Dominion's Liability Management Exercise. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on legislation related to North Anna and offshore wind facilities. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information on the Liability Management Exercise.\n \u2022 A decrease due to a charge based on the 2015 Biennial Review Order to refund revenues to customers ($20 million). \nNet revenue increased 3%, primarily reflecting:\nIn November 2015, Dominion issued $400 million of private placement short-term notes that matured in May 2016 and bore interest at a variable rate. In December 2015, Dominion issued an additional $200 million of the variable rate short-term notes that matured in May 2016. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.\n \u2022 Historical return analysis to determine long term historic returns as well as historic risk premiums for various asset classes; \n\n2016 VS. 2015\nDominion determines discount rates from analyses of AA/Aa rated bonds with cash flows matching the expected payments to be made under its plans. The discount rates used to calculate pension cost and other postretirement benefit cost ranged from 2.87% to 4.99% for pension plans and 3.56% to 4.94% for other postretirement benefit plans in 2016, were 4.40% in 2015,\nPresented below are operating statistics related to DVP's operations:\n \u2022 Extreme weather events and other natural disasters, including hurricanes, high winds, severe storms, earthquakes, flooding and changes in water temperatures and availability that can cause outages and property damage to facilities; \n \u2022 Risks associated with the operation of nuclear facilities, including costs associated with the disposal of spent nuclear fuel, decommissioning, plant maintenance and changes in existing regulations governing such facilities; \n \u2022 Changes in financial or regulatory accounting principles or policies imposed by governing bodies; \nInterest and related charges increased 12%, primarily due to higher long-term debt interest expense resulting from debt issuances in 2016 ($134 million), partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest associated with the Cove Point Liquefaction Project ($45 million).\n\n \u2022 A $46 million net increase due to services performed for Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Blue Racer. These expenses are billed to these entities and do not significantly impact net income; and \nDominion executed RCCs in connection with its issuance of the following hybrid securities:\nNet income increased 12%, primarily due to the new PJM capacity performance market effective June 2016, an increase in rate adjustment clause revenue and the absence of a write-off of deferred fuel costs associated with the Virginia legislation enacted in February 2015. These increases were partially offset by charges related to future ash pond and landfill closure costs at certain utility generation facilities.\nNet cash provided by Dominion's operating activities decreased $348 million, primarily due to higher operations and maintenance expenses, derivative activities, and increased payments for income taxes and interest. The decrease was partially offset with the benefit from the new PJM capacity performance market and higher deferred fuel cost recoveries and revenues from rate adjustment clauses in its Virginia jurisdiction.\n 57 \n \u2022 June 2009 hybrids.  In October 2014, Dominion redeemed all of the June 2009 hybrids. The redemption was conducted in compliance with the RCC.

At December 31, 2016, Dominion had established $135 million of valuation allowances.\n \u2022 An increase in depreciation, depletion, and amortization; \nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nNet income decreased 11%, primarily due to the absence of gains on the indirect sale of assets to Blue Racer, a decrease in income from NGL activities and higher interest expense, partially offset by increased gains from agreements to convey shale development rights underneath several natural gas storage fields.\n \u2022 Dominion \n \u2022 Timing and receipt of regulatory approvals necessary for planned construction or expansion projects and compliance with conditions associated with such regulatory approvals; \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nDominion is subject to costs resulting from a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect human health and the environment. These laws and regulations affect future planning and existing operations. They can result in increased capital, operating and other costs as a result of compliance, remediation, containment and monitoring obligations.\nACCOUNTING FOR REGULATED OPERATIONS\nImpairment testing for an individual or group of long-lived assets or for intangible assets with definite lives is required when circumstances indicate those assets may be impaired. When an asset's carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered impaired to the extent that the asset's fair value is less than its carrying amount. Performing an impairment test on long-lived assets involves judgment in areas such as identifying if circumstances indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets, and developing the undiscounted and discounted estimated future cash flows (used to estimate fair value in the absence of market-based value) associated with the asset, including probability weighting such cash flows to reflect expectations about possible variations in their amounts or timing, expectations about operating the long-lived assets and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. When determining whether an asset or asset group has been impaired, management groups assets at the lowest level that has identifiable cash flows. Although cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. For example, estimates of future cash flows would contemplate factors which may change over time, such as the expected use of the asset, including future production and sales levels, expected fluctuations of prices of commodities sold and consumed and expected proceeds from dispositions. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of impairments related to certain long-lived assets.\nIn September 2016, Dominion borrowed $1.2 billion under a term loan agreement that bore interest at a variable rate. The net proceeds were used to finance the Dominion Questar Combination. In December 2016, the loan was repaid with cash received from Dominion Midstream in connection with the contribution of Questar Pipeline. The loan would have otherwise matured in September 2017. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nFUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS\n \u2022 A $38 million decrease in planned outage costs primarily due to a decrease in scheduled outage days at certain non-nuclear utility generation facilities. \n \u2022 A $43 million increase from regulated natural gas distribution operations, primarily due to an increase in AMR and PIR program revenues ($24 million) and various expansion projects placed into service ($22 million); partially offset by \n \u2022 Forward-Looking Statements \n (2) Represents the portion of earnings attributable to Dominion Midstream's public unitholders.

Until the states have developed implementation plans for these standards, the impact on Dominion's facilities that emit NOX and SO2 is uncertain. Additionally, the impact of permit limits for implementing NAAQS on Dominion's facilities is uncertain at this time.\nDOMINION GAS\nPresented below are the Corporate and Other segment's after-tax results:\nAnalysis of Consolidated Operations\n\nIn April 2016, the labor contract between Dominion and Local 69 expired. In August 2016, the parties reached a tentative agreement for a new labor contract, however, the agreement was not submitted to members of Local 69 for approval. In September 2016, following a temporary lock out of union members, Local 69 agreed to not strike at DTI and Hope at least through April 1, 2017. In exchange, DTI and Hope agreed to recall the union members to work and not lock them out during that period. Contract negotiations resumed in October 2016 and are continuing. Local 69 represents approximately 760 DTI employees in West Virginia, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Virginia and approximately 150 Hope employees in West Virginia.\n \u2022 A $97 million decrease in planned outage costs primarily due to a decrease in scheduled outage days at certain merchant generation facilities ($59 million) and non-nuclear utility generation facilities ($38 million); and \n (3) Primarily consists of operating leases. \nIncome tax expense increased 20%, primarily reflecting higher pre-tax income.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet revenue increased 10%, primarily reflecting:\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016, Dominion Midstream received $482 million of proceeds from the issuance of common units and $490 million of proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred units. The net proceeds were primarily used to finance a portion of the acquisition of Questar Pipeline from Dominion.

In addition, Dominion's credit agreements contain various terms and conditions that could affect its ability to borrow under these facilities. They include maximum debt to total capital ratios and cross-default provisions.\nDominion expects to fund its capital expenditures with cash from operations and a combination of securities issuances and short-term borrowings. Planned capital expenditures include capital projects that are subject to approval by regulators and the Board of Directors.\n2015 VS. 2014\nEnvironmental Matters\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nLIABILITY MANAGEMENT\n \u2022 A $30 million increase from regulated natural gas transmission operations, primarily reflecting: \n \u2022 A $78 million decrease in gains from agreements to convey shale development rights underneath several natural gas storage fields; and \n \u2022 A $225 million electric capacity benefit, primarily due to the new PJM capacity performance market effective June 2016 ($155 million) and the expiration of non-utility generator contracts in 2015 ($58 million); \nIn 2016, 2015 and 2014, Dominion recognized $104 million, $93 million and $81 million, respectively, of accretion, and expects to recognize $117 million in 2017. Dominion records accretion and depreciation associated with utility nuclear decommissioning AROs and regulated pipeline replacement\n \u2022 A $26 million decrease in bad debt expense at regulated natural gas distribution operations primarily related to low income assistance programs. These bad debt expenses are recovered through rates and do not impact net income.  Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased 12%, primarily due to various expansion projects being placed into service.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n 45 \nDominion believes that its operations provide a stable source of cash flow to contribute to planned levels of capital expenditures and maintain or grow the dividend on common shares. In December 2016, Dominion's Board of Directors established an annual dividend rate for 2017 of $3.02 per share of common stock, a 7.9% increase over the 2016 rate. Dividends are subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. In January 2017, Dominion's Board of Directors declared dividends payable in March 2017 of 75.5 cents per share of common stock.\n2016 VS. 2015\nalternative plans that represent plausible compliance strategies with the rule as proposed, and which include additional coal unit retirements and additional low or zero-carbon resources. The final rule has been challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. In February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay of the Clean Power Plan until the disposition of the petitions challenging the rule now before the Court of Appeals, and, if such petitions are filed in the future, before the U.S. Supreme Court. Dominion does not know whether these legal challenges will impact the submittal deadlines for the state implementation plans. In June 2016, the Governor of Virginia signed an executive order directing the Virginia Natural Resources Secretary to convene a workgroup charged with recommending concrete steps to reduce carbon pollution which include the Clean Power Plan as an option. Unless the rule survives the court challenges and until the state plans are developed and the EPA approves the plans, Dominion cannot predict the potential financial statement impacts but believes the potential expenditures to comply could be material.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nItem 7.

The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes and to repay short-term debt, including commercial paper. \nIncome tax expense increased 100%, primarily reflecting higher pre-tax income.\n \u2022 Changes in implementation and enforcement practices of regulators relating to environmental standards and litigation exposure for remedial activities; \nAs part of borrowing funds and issuing debt (both short-term and long-term) or preferred securities, Dominion must enter into enabling agreements. These agreements contain covenants that, in the event of default, could result in the acceleration of principal and interest payments; restrictions on distributions related to capital stock, including dividends, redemptions, repurchases, liquidation payments or guarantee payments; and in some cases, the termination of credit commitments unless a waiver of such requirements is agreed to by the lenders/security holders. These provisions are customary, with each agreement specifying which covenants apply. These provisions are not necessarily unique to Dominion.\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\n (1) Includes Dominion Questar effective September 2016. \n (2) The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 10% of the total net credit exposure. \n (3) Includes Dominion Questar customer accounts for the entire year. \nDuring 2016, Dominion issued the following long-term public debt:\n Dominion monitors these debt covenants on a regular basis in order to ensure that events of default will not occur. As of December 31, 2016, there have been no events of default under Dominion's debt covenants.\nIncome tax expense decreased 15% primarily reflecting lower pre-tax income.\n \u2022 In March 2016 and May 2016, Dominion successfully remarketed the $550 million 2013 Series A 1.07% RSNs due 2021 and the $550 million 2013 Series B 1.18% RSNs due 2019, respectively, pursuant to the terms of the related 2013 Equity Units. In connection with the remarketings, the interest rates on the Series A and Series B junior subordinated notes were reset to 4.104% and 2.962%, respectively. Dominion did not receive any proceeds from the remarketings.

The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes and to repay short-term debt, including commercial paper.  During 2016, Dominion also remarketed the following long-term debt:\n (4) Amounts exclude open purchase orders for services that are provided on demand, the timing of which cannot be determined. \n \u2022 Adverse outcomes in litigation matters or regulatory proceedings; and \n \u2022 An increase from rate adjustment clauses ($225 million); \nCREDIT RISK\n2016 issuance of $1.3 billion of senior notes, (3) September 2016 borrowing of $1.2 billion under a term loan agreement, which was repaid with cash received from Dominion Midstream in connection with the contribution of Questar Pipeline and (4) $500 million of the proceeds from the April 2016 issuance of common stock.\n \u2022 An increase from rate adjustment clauses ($225 million); \nGiven the uncertainty and judgment involved in the determination and filing of income taxes, there are standards for recognition and measurement in financial statements of positions taken or expected to be taken by an entity in its income tax returns. Positions taken by an entity in its income tax returns that are recognized in the financial statements must satisfy a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, assuming that the position will be examined by tax authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information. At December 31, 2016, Dominion had $64 million of unrecognized tax benefits. Changes in these unrecognized tax benefits may result from remeasurement of amounts expected to be realized, settlements with tax authorities and expiration of statutes of limitations.\n Overview\n \u2022 A $47 million net increase due to services performed for Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Blue Racer.

The financial accounting treatment of the lease agreement will be impacted by the new accounting standard issued in February 2016. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Dominion will be considered the owner of the leased property for tax purposes, and as a result, will be entitled to tax deductions for depreciation and interest expense.\nIn March 2016, Fitch and Standard & Poor's changed the rating for Dominion's junior subordinated debt securities to account for its inability to defer interest payments on the remarketed 2013 Series A RSNs. Subsequently, junior subordinated debt securities without an interest deferral feature are rated one notch higher by Fitch and Standard & Poor's (BBB) than junior subordinated debt securities with an interest deferral feature (BBB-). See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the remarketed notes.\n2015 VS. 2014\nIn July 2016, Dominion signed an agreement with a lessor to construct and lease a new corporate office property in Richmond, Virginia. The lessor is providing equity and has obtained financing commitments from debt investors, totaling $365 million, to fund the estimated project costs. The project is expected to be completed by mid-2019. Dominion has been appointed to act as the construction agent for the lessor, during which time Dominion will request cash draws from the lessor and debt investors to fund all project costs, which totaled $46 million as of December 31, 2016. If the project is terminated under certain events of default, Dominion could be required to pay up to 89.9% of the then funded amount. For specific full recourse events, Dominion could be required to pay up to 100% of the then funded amount.\n \u2022 An increase in sales to retail customers, primarily due to a net increase in cooling degree days ($38 million); and \n \u2022 Fluctuations in the value of investments held in nuclear decommissioning trusts by Dominion and Virginia Power and in benefit plan trusts by Dominion and Dominion Gas; \n \u2022 Compliance with collateral minimums or requirements related to mortgage bonds; and \nSee Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on Dominion's employee benefit plans.\n \u2022 Unusual weather conditions and their effect on energy sales to customers and energy commodity prices; \nOther operations and maintenance increased 18%, primarily reflecting:\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOther operations and maintenance decreased 15%, primarily reflecting:\nJudgment and the use of estimates are required in developing the provision for income taxes and reporting of tax-related assets and liabilities. The interpretation of tax laws involves uncertainty, since tax authorities may interpret the laws differently. Ultimate resolution of income tax matters may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income and cash flows, and adjustments to tax-related assets and liabilities could be material.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act was enacted into law in July 2010 in an effort to improve regulation of financial markets. The CEA, as amended by Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, requires certain over-the counter derivatives, or swaps, to be cleared through a derivatives clearing organization and, if the swap is subject to a clearing requirement, to be executed on a designated contract market or swap execution facility. Non-financial entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk, often referred to as end users, may elect the end-user exception to the CEA's clearing requirements. Dominion has elected to exempt its swaps from the CEA's clearing requirements. The CFTC may continue to adopt final rules and implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act through its ongoing rulemaking process, including rules regarding margin requirements for non-cleared swaps. If, as a result of the rulemaking process, Dominion's derivative activities are not exempted from clearing, exchange trading or margin requirements, it could be subject to higher costs due to decreased market liquidity or increased margin payments. In addition, Dominion's swap dealer counterparties may attempt to pass-through additional trading costs in connection with the implementation of, and compliance with, Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. Due to the evolving rulemaking process, Dominion is currently unable to assess the potential impact of the Dodd-Frank Act's derivative-related provisions on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n2016 VS. 2015\n (1) Primarily represents absence of a gain from the sale of the Northern System. \nNet cash used in Dominion's investing activities increased $4.2 billion, primarily due to the Dominion Questar Combination and higher capital expenditures, partially offset by the absence of Dominion's acquisition of DCG in 2015 and the acquisition of fewer solar development projects in 2016.\n \u2022 In February 2016, Dominion issued $500 million of 2.125% senior notes in a private placement. The notes mature in 2018. The proceeds were used to repay or repurchase short-term debt, including commercial paper and short-term notes, and for general corporate purposes. \nSee Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of potential restrictions on dividend payments by Dominion in connection with the deferral of interest payments and contract adjustment payments on certain junior subordinated notes and equity units, initially in the form of corporate units, which information is incorporated herein by reference.\n \u2022 A $20 million increase in services performed for Atlantic Coast Pipeline. These expenses are billed to Atlantic Coast Pipeline and do not significantly impact net income; and \nDominion has identified the following accounting policies, including certain inherent estimates, that as a result of the judgments, uncertainties, uniqueness and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved, could result in material changes to its financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different assumptions. Dominion has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these policies with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\n \u2022 The inclusion of operations acquired from Dominion Questar for the entire year; \nIn January 2017, Dominion issued $400 million of 1.875% senior notes and $400 million of 2.75% senior notes that mature in 2019 and 2022, respectively.\nNet revenue increased 11%, primarily reflecting:\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nACCOUNTING MATTERS\n \u2022 An $85 million write-off of deferred fuel costs associated with Virginia legislation enacted in February 2015; \nDominion develops assumptions, which are then compared to the forecasts of an independent investment advisor to ensure reasonableness. An internal committee selects the final assumptions. Dominion calculated its pension cost using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption of 8.75% for 2016, 2015 and 2014. For 2017, the expected long-term rate of return for pension cost assumption is 8.75%. Dominion calculated its other postretirement benefit cost using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption of 8.50% for 2016, 2015 and 2014. For 2017, the expected long-term rate of return for other postretirement benefit cost assumption is 8.50%. The rate used in calculating other postretirement benefit cost is lower than the rate used in calculating pension cost because of differences in the relative amounts of various types of investments held as plan assets.\n \u2022 The absence of $370 million in charges associated with Virginia legislation enacted in April 2014 relating to the development of a third nuclear unit located at North Anna and offshore wind facilities; and \n2015 VS. 2014\n \u2022 An $18 million increase in AMR and PIR program revenues; and \n \u2022 Organizational design initiative costs ($32 million).

In addition, capital expenditures related to environmental controls were $191 million, $94 million, and $101 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These expenditures are expected to be approximately $185 million and $115 million for 2017 and 2018, respectively.\n \u2022 Lower power prices and an additional planned refueling outage at Millstone; \n Presented below, on an after-tax basis, are the key factors impacting Dominion Generation's net income contribution:\n \u2022 A $225 million electric capacity benefit, primarily due to the new PJM capacity performance market effective June 2016 ($155 million) and the expiration of non-utility generator contracts in 2015 ($58 million); \nother liabilities, amounts are based upon contract terms, including fixed and minimum quantities to be purchased at fixed or market-based prices. Actual cash payments will be based upon actual quantities purchased and prices paid and will likely differ from amounts presented below. The table excludes all amounts classified as current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than current maturities of long-term debt, interest payable and certain derivative instruments. The majority of Dominion's current liabilities will be paid in cash in 2017.\nInterest and related charges increased $46 million, primarily due to higher long-term debt interest expense resulting from debt issuances in December 2014.\n \u2022 The absence of losses related to the retail electric energy marketing business which was sold in the first quarter of 2014 ($129 million); \nFUTURE ISSUES AND OTHER MATTERS\n \u2022 Liquidity and Capital Resources-Dominion \nAnalysis of Consolidated Operations\n \u2022 A decrease in rate adjustment clause revenue related to low income assistance programs ($26 million); and \n \u2022 A $33 million net increase in other revenue primarily due to services performed for Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Blue Racer ($47 million), partially offset by a decrease in non-regulated gas sales ($8 million) and decreased farm-out revenues ($6 million). \n \u2022 The absence of a gain on the sale of Dominion's electric retail energy marketing business in March 2014 ($100 million), net of a $31 million write-off of goodwill; \nject to the provisions of FASB guidance that dictate a guarantor's accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others.

Presented below is a summary of Dominion's credit exposure as of December 31, 2016 for these activities. Gross credit exposure for each counterparty is calculated as outstanding receivables plus any unrealized on- or off-balance sheet exposure, taking into account contractual netting rights.\n \u2022 Expected future risk premiums, asset volatilities and correlations; \n \u2022 Cost of environmental compliance, including those costs related to climate change; \nDominion's strategy is to continue focusing on its regulated businesses while maintaining upside potential in well-positioned nonregulated businesses. The goals of this strategy are to provide EPS growth, a growing dividend and to maintain a stable credit profile. Dominion expects 80% to 90% of earnings from its primary operating segments to come from regulated and long-term contracted businesses.\n \u2022 An increase in gains from agreements to convey shale development rights underneath several natural gas storage fields ($63 million); \n 56 \nA significant portion of Dominion's AROs relates to the future decommissioning of its merchant and utility nuclear facilities. These nuclear decommissioning AROs are reported in the Dominion Generation segment. At December 31, 2016, Dominion's nuclear decommissioning AROs totaled $1.5 billion, representing approximately 60% of its total AROs. Based on their significance, the following discussion of critical assumptions inherent in determining the fair value of AROs relates to those associated with Dominion's nuclear decommissioning obligations.\n An analysis of Dominion Gas' results of operations follows:\nDominion currently meets the definition of a well-known seasoned issuer under SEC rules governing the registration, communications and offering processes under the Securities Act of 1933. The rules provide for a streamlined shelf registration process to provide registrants with timely access to capital. This allows Dominion to use automatic shelf registration statements to register any offering of securities, other than those for exchange offers or business combination transactions.\n \u2022 A $50 million increase in storm damage and service restoration costs, including $23 million for Hurricane Matthew; \n \u2022 A $21 million increase in services performed for Atlantic Coast Pipeline; and \nDominion primarily enters into guarantee arrangements on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries. These arrangements are not sub-\n In addition to the effects on cost, at December 31, 2016, a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase Dominion's projected pension benefit obligation by $287 million and its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $43 million, while a 1.00% increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would increase its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $152 million.\nVS. 2015\nranged from 5.20% to 5.30% for pension plans and 4.20% to 5.10% for other postretirement benefit plans in 2014. Dominion selected a discount rate ranging from 3.31% to 4.50% for pension plans and ranging from 3.92% to 4.47% for other postretirement benefit plans for determining its December 31, 2016 projected benefit obligations.\n \u2022 A $34 million decrease from regulated natural gas transmission operations, primarily reflecting: \n\n 49 \n \u2022 A $17 million decrease in NGL activities, due to decreased prices ($15 million) and volumes ($2 million); partially offset by \n \u2022 Risks of operating businesses in regulated industries that are subject to changing regulatory structures; \n \u2022 A $9 million decrease in other revenue primarily due to a decrease in pooling and metering activities ($3 million), a decrease in Blue Racer management fees ($3 million) and a decrease in gathering activities ($2 million); partially offset by \n \u2022 The timely payment of principal and interest; \n\nDominion recognizes liabilities for the expected cost of retiring tangible long-lived assets for which a legal obligation exists and the ARO can be reasonably estimated. These AROs are recognized at fair value as incurred and are capitalized as part of the cost of the related long-lived assets. In the absence of quoted market prices, Dominion estimates the fair value of its AROs using present value techniques, in which it makes various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, credit-adjusted risk free rates and cost escalation rates. The impact on measurements of new AROs or remeasurements of existing AROs, using different cost escalation rates in the future, may be significant. When Dominion revises any assumptions used to calculate the fair value of existing AROs, it adjusts the carrying amount of both the ARO liability and the related long-lived asset for assets that are in service; for assets that have ceased operations, Dominion adjusts the carrying amount of the ARO liability with such changes recognized in income. Dominion accretes the ARO liability to reflect the passage of time. In 2016, Dominion recorded an increase in AROs of $449 million primarily related to future ash pond and landfill closure costs at certain utility generation facilities and the Dominion Questar Combination. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nPresented below are selected amounts related to Virginia Power's results of operations:\nFrom time to time, Dominion may reduce its outstanding debt and level of interest expense through redemption of debt securities prior to maturity and repurchases in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, through tender offers or otherwise.\n 53 \nThe Companies' forward-looking statements are based on beliefs and assumptions using information available at the time the statements are made. The Companies caution the reader not to place undue reliance on their forward-looking statements because the assumptions, beliefs, expectations and projections about future events may, and often do, differ materially from actual results. The Companies undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect developments occurring after the statement is made.\nMortality rates are developed from actual and projected plan experience for postretirement benefit plans. Dominion's actuary conducts an experience study periodically as part of the process to select its best estimate of mortality. Dominion considers both standard mortality tables and improvement factors as well as the plans' actual experience when selecting a best estimate.

Under certain collateral arrangements, Dominion may satisfy these requirements by electing to either deposit cash, post letters of credit or, in some cases, utilize other forms of security. From time to time, Dominion may vary the form of collateral provided to counterparties after weighing the costs and benefits of various factors associated with the different forms of collateral. These factors include short-term borrowing and short-term investment rates, the spread over these short-term rates at which Dominion can issue commercial paper, balance sheet impacts, the costs and fees of alternative collateral postings with these and other counterparties and overall liquidity management objectives.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nThis report contains statements concerning the Companies' expectations, plans, objectives, future financial performance and other statements that are not historical facts.

Dominion determines the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets for pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans by using a combination of:\n\nIn both April 2016 and July 2016, Dominion issued 8.5 million shares under the related stock purchase contract entered into as part of Dominion's 2013 Equity Units and received $1.1 billion of total proceeds. Additionally, Dominion completed a market issuance of equity in April 2016 of 10.2 million shares and received proceeds of $756 million through a registered underwritten public offering. A portion of the net proceeds was used to finance the Dominion Questar Combination. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\ninvested in Dominion's common stock. These shares may either be newly issued or purchased on the open market with proceeds contributed to these plans. In January 2014, Dominion began purchasing its common stock on the open market for these plans. In April 2014, Dominion began issuing new common shares for these direct stock purchase plans.\nInterest and related charges increased 29%, primarily due to higher interest expense resulting from the issuances of senior notes in November 2015 and the second quarter of 2016 ($28 million), partially offset by an increase in deferred rate adjustment clause interest expense ($7 million).\nSome of the typical covenants include:\n \u2022 Changes in technology, particularly with respect to new, developing or alternative sources of generation and smart grid technologies; \n \u2022 A $62 million decrease from NGL activities, primarily due to decreased prices; partially offset by \nNet revenue increased 1%, primarily reflecting:\nIn accordance with the terms of the Dominion Questar Combination, at closing, each share of issued and outstanding Dominion Questar common stock was converted into the right to receive $25.00 per share in cash. The total consideration was $4.4 billion based on 175.5 million shares of Dominion Questar outstanding at closing. Dominion also acquired Dominion Questar's outstanding debt of approximately $1.5 billion.

The strategic target asset allocation for Dominion's pension funds is 28% U.S. equity, 18% non-U.S. equity, 35% fixed income, 3% real estate and 16% other alternative investments, such as private equity investments.  Strategic investment policies are established for Dominion's prefunded benefit plans based upon periodic asset/liability studies. Factors considered in setting the investment policy include those mentioned above such as employee demographics, liability growth rates, future discount rates, the funded status of the plans and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Deviations from the plans' strategic allocation are a function of Dominion's assessments regarding short-term risk and reward opportunities in the capital markets and/or short-term market movements which result in the plans' actual asset allocations varying from the strategic target asset allocations. Through periodic rebalancing, actual allocations are brought back in line with the target. Future asset/liability studies will focus on strategies to further reduce pension and other postretirement plan risk, while still achieving attractive levels of returns.\nSee DVP, Dominion Generation and Dominion Energy-Properties in Item 1. Business for a discussion of Dominion's expansion plans.\nAt December 31, 2016, the termination dates and covered debt under the RCCs associated with Dominion's hybrids were as follows:\nBoth quantitative (financial strength) and qualitative (business or operating characteristics) factors are considered by the credit rating agencies in establishing an individual company's credit rating. Credit ratings should be evaluated independently and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. The credit ratings for Dominion are affected by its financial profile, mix of regulated and nonregulated businesses and respective cash flows, changes in methodologies used by the rating agencies and event risk, if applicable, such as major acquisitions or dispositions.\nNet revenue increased 10%, primarily reflecting:\n \u2022 An increase in sales to retail customers, primarily due to a net increase in cooling degree days ($38 million); and \n \u2022 Results of Operations \n \u2022 Changes in rating agency requirements or credit ratings and their effect on availability and cost of capital; \nDominion evaluates whether or not recovery of its regulatory assets through future rates is probable and makes various assumptions in its analysis. The expectations of future recovery are generally based on orders issued by regulatory commissions, legislation or historical experience, as well as discussions with applicable regulatory authorities and legal counsel. If recovery of a regulatory asset is determined to be less than probable, it will be written off in the period such assessment is made. See Notes 12 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nDominion Questar's revolving multi-year and 364-day credit facilities with limits of $500 million and $250 million, respectively, were terminated in October 2016.\n \u2022 The timing and execution of Dominion Midstream's growth strategy; \nIn February 2016, Standard & Poor's lowered the following ratings for Dominion: issuer to BBB+ from A-, senior unsecured debt securities to BBB from BBB+ and junior/remarketable subordinated debt securities to BBB- from BBB. In addition, Standard & Poor's affirmed Dominion's commercial paper rating of A-2 and revised its outlook to stable from negative.\nAir\n 44 \nPresented below is a summary of Virginia Power's consolidated results:\nOutlook\n \u2022 Performance obligations, audits/inspections, continuation of the basic nature of business, restrictions on certain matters related to merger or consolidation and restrictions on disposition of all or substantially all assets; \nACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE\n \u2022 A $148 million increase due to the Dominion Questar Combination, including $58 million of transaction and transition costs; \nDominion maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.\n \u2022 Forecasts of an independent investment advisor; \n \u2022 Organizational design initiative costs ($64 million); \nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting standards.\n \u2022 A $53 million increase in utility nuclear refueling outage costs primarily due to the amortization of outage costs that were previously deferred pursuant to Virginia legislation enacted in April 2014.  Other income decreased 27%, primarily reflecting lower tax recoveries associated with contributions in aid of construction.\nDepreciation and amortization increased 10% primarily due to various expansion projects placed into service.\nDVP\n \u2022 The inability to complete planned construction, conversion or expansion projects at all, or with the outcomes or within the terms and time frames initially anticipated; \n \u2022 Domestic terrorism and other threats to the Companies' physical and intangible assets, as well as threats to cybersecurity; \nThe accounting for Dominion's regulated electric and gas operations differs from the accounting for nonregulated operations in that Dominion is required to reflect the effect of rate regulation in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For regulated businesses subject to federal or state cost-of-service rate regulation, regulatory practices that assign costs to accounting periods may differ from accounting methods generally applied by nonregulated companies. When it is probable that regulators will permit the recovery of current costs through future rates charged to customers, these costs that otherwise would be expensed by nonregulated companies are deferred as regulatory assets. Likewise, regulatory liabilities are recognized when it is probable that regulators will require customer refunds through future rates or when revenue is collected from customers for expenditures that have yet to be incurred. Generally, regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into income over the period authorized by the regulator.\nIn April of each year, Dominion tests its goodwill for potential impairment, and performs additional tests more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change in the interim that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The 2016, 2015 and 2014 annual tests and any interim tests did not result in the recognition of any goodwill impairment.\n (2) In January 2016, this facility limit was increased from $4.0 billion to $5.0 billion. \nDominion's 2017 results are expected to be negatively impacted by the following:\nDominion sponsors noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for eligible active employees, retirees and qualifying dependents. The projected costs of providing benefits under these plans are dependent, in part, on historical information such as employee demographics, the level of contributions made to the plans and earnings on plan assets. Assumptions about the future, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates applied to benefit obligations, mortality rates and the anticipated rate of increase in healthcare costs and participant compensation, also have a significant impact on employee benefit costs. The impact of changes in these factors, as well as differences between Dominion's\nAROs as an adjustment to the regulatory liabilities related to these items.\nThese estimates are based on a capital expenditures plan reviewed and endorsed by Dominion's Board of Directors in late 2016 and are subject to continuing review and adjustment and actual capital expenditures may vary from these estimates. Dominion may also choose to postpone or cancel certain planned capital expenditures in order to mitigate the need for future debt financings and equity issuances.\n \u2022 Impacts of acquisitions, including the recently completed Dominion Questar Combination, divestitures, transfers of assets to joint ventures or Dominion Midstream, including the recently completed contribution of Questar Pipeline to Dominion Midstream, and retirements of assets based on asset portfolio reviews; \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nDominion uses derivative contracts such as physical and financial forwards, futures, swaps, options and FTRs to manage commodity, interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks of its business operations. Derivative contracts, with certain exceptions, are reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Accounting requirements for derivatives and related hedging activities are complex and may be subject to further clarification by standard-setting bodies. The majority of investments held in Dominion's nuclear decommissioning and rabbi trusts and pension and other postretirement funds are also subject to fair value accounting. See Notes 6 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these fair value measurements.\n \u2022 The impact of operational hazards, including adverse developments with respect to pipeline and plant safety or integrity, equipment loss, malfunction or failure, operator error, and other catastrophic events.  Additionally, other risks that could cause actual results to differ from predicted results are set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n \u2022 A $26 million decrease in bad debt expense at regulated natural gas distribution operations primarily related to low income assistance programs. These bad debt expenses are recovered through rates and do not impact net income.  Other income increased $10 million, primarily due to a gain on the sale of 0.65% of the noncontrolling partnership interest in Iroquois ($5 million) and an increase in AFUDC associated with rate-regulated projects ($5 million).\n \u2022 Share dilution.  Additionally, in 2017, Dominion expects to focus on meeting new and developing environmental requirements, including making investments in utility-scale solar generation, particularly in Virginia. In 2018, Dominion is expected to experience an increase in net income on a per share basis as compared to 2017 primarily due to the Liquefaction Project being in service for the full year.\n \u2022 In December 2016, SBL Holdco borrowed $405 million under a term loan agreement that bears interest at a variable rate. The term loan amortizes over an 18-year period and matures in December 2023. The debt is nonrecourse to Dominion and is secured by SBL Holdco's interest in certain merchant solar facilities. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.  During 2016, Dominion repaid $1.8 billion of short-term notes and repaid and repurchased $1.6 billion of long-term debt.\n \u2022 A $36 million decrease in gas transportation and storage activities, primarily due to decreased demand charges ($28 million), increased fuel costs ($13 million), contract rate changes ($11 million) and decreased revenue from gathering and extraction services ($8 million), partially offset by increased regulated gas sales ($16 million) and expansion projects placed in service ($9 million); and \nOther income increased 28%, primarily due to an increase in earnings from equity method investments ($55 million) and an increase in AFUDC associated with rate-regulated projects ($12 million), partially offset by lower realized gains (net of investment income) on nuclear decommissioning trust funds ($19 million).\nENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND MONITORING EXPENDITURES\n \u2022 An $85 million write-off of deferred fuel costs associated with Virginia legislation enacted in February 2015; \nCREDIT FACILITIES AND SHORT-TERM DEBT\nSHORT-TERM NOTES\n \u2022 Fluctuations in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates; \n \u2022 In December 2016, Dominion Midstream borrowed $300 million under a term loan agreement that matures in December 2019 and bears interest at a variable rate. The net proceeds were used to finance a portion of the acquisition of Questar Pipeline from Dominion. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. \nDominion is party to numerous contracts and arrangements obligating it to make cash payments in future years. These contracts include financing arrangements such as debt agreements and leases, as well as contracts for the purchase of goods and services and financial derivatives. Presented below is a table summarizing cash payments that may result from contracts to which Dominion is a party as of December 31, 2016. For purchase obligations and\nDominion's commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding, as well as capacity available under credit facilities, were as follows:\n2015 VS. 2014\n (1) Represents noncontrolling interest related to merchant solar partnerships.  2015 VS.\n \u2022 A $38 million increase from regulated natural gas distribution operations, primarily due to an increase in rate adjustment clause revenue related to low income assistance programs ($12 million), an increase in AMR and PIR program revenues ($24 million) and various expansion projects placed into service ($22 million); partially offset by a decrease in gathering revenues ($9 million); and \n (1) Period average.  Presented below, on an after-tax basis, are the key factors impacting DVP's net income contribution:\nNet income increased 27%, primarily due to the absence of charges associated with Virginia legislation enacted in April 2014 relating to the development of a third nuclear unit located at North Anna and offshore wind facilities.\nCONTENTS OF MD&A\n \u2022 An increase from rate adjustment clauses ($183 million); and \n 2016. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes and to repay short-term debt, including commercial paper. \nNet income attributable to Dominion increased 12%, primarily due to higher renewable energy investment tax credits and the new PJM capacity performance market effective June 2016. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in gains from agreements to convey shale development rights underneath several natural gas storage fields and charges related to future ash pond and landfill closure costs at certain utility generation facilities.\nMD&A discusses Dominion's results of operations and general financial condition and Virginia Power's and Dominion Gas' results of operations. MD&A should be read in conjunction with Item 1. Business and the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Virginia Power and Dominion Gas meet the conditions to file under the reduced disclosure format, and therefore have omitted certain sections of MD&A.\nNet revenue decreased 3%, primarily reflecting:\n \u2022 Competition in the development, construction and ownership of certain electric transmission facilities in Virginia Power's service territory in connection with FERC Order 1000; \n \u2022 The absence of charges associated with Virginia legislation enacted in April 2014 relating to the development of a third nuclear unit located at North Anna and offshore wind facilities ($370 million); \n \u2022 A $305 million increase due to the Dominion Questar Combination.  These increases were partially offset by:\nLEASING ARRANGEMENT\n \u2022 Difficulty in anticipating mitigation requirements associated with environmental and other regulatory approvals; \nINCOME TAXES\n \u2022 Risks associated with Virginia Power's membership and participation in PJM, including risks related to obligations created by the default of other participants; \nIn December 2015, the Paris Agreement was formally adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The accord establishes a universal framework for addressing GHG emissions involving actions by all nations through the concept of nationally determined contributions in which each nation defines the GHG commitment it can make and sets in place a process for increasing those commitments every five years. It also contains a global goal of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to aim to reach global peaking of GHG emissions as soon as possible.\nSEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nPURCHASE OF DOMINION MIDSTREAM UNITS\n (7) Includes interest rate and foreign currency swap agreements.  PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES\nFair value is based on actively-quoted market prices, if available. In the absence of actively-quoted market prices, management seeks indicative price information from external sources, including broker quotes and industry publications. When evaluating pricing information provided by brokers and other pricing services, Dominion considers whether the broker is willing and able to trade at the quoted price, if the broker quotes are based on an active market or an inactive market and the extent to which brokers are utilizing a particular model if pricing is not readily available. If pricing information from external sources is not available, or if Dominion believes that observable pricing information is not indicative of fair value, judgment is required to develop the estimates of fair value. In those cases, Dominion must estimate prices based on available historical and near-term future price information and use of statistical methods, including regression analysis, that reflect its market assumptions.\n 2015 VS. 2014\n \u2022 Receipt of approvals for, and timing of, closing dates for acquisitions and divestitures; \n \u2022 An $80 million increase in certain electric transmission-related expenditures.

Known as the Clean Power Plan, the rule uses a set of measures for reducing emissions from existing sources that includes efficiency improvements at coal plants, displacing coal-fired generation with increased utilization of natural gas combined cycle units and expanding renewable resources. The new rule requires states to impose standards of performance limits for existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units or equivalent statewide intensity-based or mass-based CO2 binding goals or limits. States are required to submit final plans identifying how they will comply with the rule by September 2018. The EPA also issued a proposed federal plan and model trading rule that states can adopt or that would be put in place if, in response to the final guidelines, a state either does not submit a state plan or its plan is not approved by the EPA.

Although Dominion has consistently applied the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates that underlie the fair value calculations, such as estimates of future cash flows, and based those estimates on relevant information available at the time, such cash flow estimates are highly uncertain by nature and may vary significantly from actual results. If the estimates of future cash flows used in the most recent tests had been 10% lower, the resulting fair values would have still been greater than the carrying values of each of those reporting units tested, indicating that no impairment was present.\nDominion maintains Dominion Direct\u00ae and a number of employee savings plans through which contributions may be\n \u2022 A $14 million decrease in gas transportation and storage activities, primarily due to decreased demand charges ($28 million), increased fuel costs ($13 million), contract rate changes ($11 million) and decreased revenue from gathering and extraction services ($8 million), partially offset by expansion projects placed in service ($18 million) and increased regulated gas sales ($20 million); and \n (1) Designations as investment grade are based upon minimum credit ratings assigned by Moody's and Standard & Poor's.

Dominion believes that its current credit ratings provide sufficient access to the capital markets. However, disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to Dominion may affect its ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors. Dominion's credit ratings affect its liquidity, cost of borrowing under credit facilities and collateral posting requirements under commodity contracts, as well as the rates at which it is able to offer its debt securities.\nThe CAA is a comprehensive program utilizing a broad range of regulatory tools to protect and preserve the nation's air quality.

In addition, if the defaulting company is Virginia Power, Dominion's obligations to repay any outstanding borrowing under the credit facilities could also be accelerated and the lenders' commitments to Dominion could terminate.\n \u2022 Future Issues and Other Matters-Dominion \n2016 VS. 2015\nPresented below are operating statistics related to Dominion Generation's operations:\nIn March 2016, as part of its Climate Action Plan, the EPA began development of regulations for reducing methane emissions\n \u2022 Results of Operations \n \u2022 Changes to regulated electric rates collected by Virginia Power and regulated gas distribution, transportation and storage rates, including LNG storage, collected by Dominion and Dominion Gas; \n \u2022 A $12 million increase in other revenues, primarily due to an increase in services performed for Atlantic Coast Pipeline ($21 million), partially offset by decreased amortization of deferred revenue associated with conveyed shale development rights ($4 million); and \n \u2022 A decrease in capacity related expenses ($33 million); partially offset by \nDominion establishes the healthcare cost trend rate assumption based on analyses of various factors including the specific provisions of its medical plans, actual cost trends experienced and projected, and demographics of plan participants. Dominion's healthcare cost trend rate assumption as of December 31, 2016 was 7.00% and is expected to gradually decrease to 5.00% by 2021 and continue at that rate for years thereafter.\nDominion uses short-term debt to fund working capital requirements and as a bridge to long-term debt financings. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly during the course of the year, depending upon the timing and amount of cash requirements not satisfied by cash from operations. In January 2016, Dominion expanded its short-term funding resources through a $1.0 billion increase to one of its joint revolving credit facility limits. In addition, Dominion utilizes cash and letters of credit to fund collateral requirements. Collateral requirements are impacted by commodity prices, hedging levels, Dominion's credit ratings and the credit quality of its counterparties.\nGUARANTEES\nCorporate and Other includes specific items attributable to Dominion's primary operating segments that are not included in profit measures evaluated by executive management in assessing the segments' performance or in allocating resources. See Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of these items in more detail. Corporate and other also includes specific items attributable to the Corporate and Other segment. In 2016, this primarily included $53 million of after-tax transaction and transition costs associated with the Dominion Questar Combination. In 2014, this primarily included $174 million of after-tax charges associated with Dominion's Liability Management Exercise.\n2016 VS. 2015\n (1) Based on stated maturity dates rather than the earlier redemption dates that could be elected by instrument holders. \nDominion relies on capital markets as significant sources of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by cash provided by its operations. As discussed in Credit Ratings, Dominion's ability to borrow funds or issue securities and the return demanded by investors are affected by credit ratings. In addition, the raising of external capital is subject to certain regulatory requirements, including registration with the SEC for certain issuances.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the calculated total debt to total capital ratio, pursuant to the terms of the agreements, was as follows:\nDominion's planned capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $5.8 billion, $5.0 billion and $5.2 billion in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. Dominion's planned expenditures are expected to include construction and expansion of electric generation and natural gas transmission and storage facilities, construction improvements and expansion of electric transmission and distribution assets, purchases of nuclear fuel, maintenance and the construction of the Liquefaction Project and Dominion's portion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline.\nAnalysis of Consolidated Operations\n \u2022 A decrease in sales to customers due to the effect of changes in customer usage and other factors ($24 million); and \n \u2022 The absence of gains on the sale of assets to Blue Racer ($59 million); \n \u2022 An increase from rate adjustment clauses ($183 million); and \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\n \u2022 A $98 million increase in charges related to future ash pond and landfill closure costs at certain utility generation facilities; \nIn general, Dominion estimates the fair value of its reporting units by using a combination of discounted cash flows and other valuation techniques that use multiples of earnings for peer group companies and analyses of recent business combinations involving peer group companies. Fair value estimates are dependent on subjective factors such as Dominion's estimate of future cash flows, the selection of appropriate discount and growth rates, and the selection of peer group companies and recent transactions. These underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time; subsequent modifications, particularly changes in\n \u2022 A $61 million increase in gas transportation and storage activities, primarily due to the addition of DCG ($62 million), decreased fuel costs ($24 million) and various expansion projects placed into service ($24 million), partially offset by decreased regulated gas sales ($46 million); and \nAt December 31, 2016, Dominion had $2.3 billion of unused capacity under its credit facilities. See additional discussion below under Credit Facilities and Short-Term Debt.\n \u2022 A $159 million increase from electric utility operations, primarily reflecting: \n \u2022 Expected inflation and risk-free interest rate assumptions; \n \u2022 An increase in gains from agreements to convey shale development rights underneath several natural gas storage fields ($63 million). \nDominion's operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that may negatively impact the timing or amounts of operating cash flows, and which are discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n 43 \nPresented below is a summary of Dominion Gas' consolidated results:\n \u2022 A $544 million increase from electric utility operations, primarily reflecting: \n \u2022 Changes in operating, maintenance and construction costs; \nThe Companies make forward-looking statements with full knowledge that risks and uncertainties exist that may cause actual results to differ materially from predicted results. Factors that may cause actual results to differ are often presented with the forward-looking statements themselves. Additionally, other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward-looking statement. These factors include but are not limited to:\n2015 VS. 2014\nREPURCHASE OF COMMON STOCK\nPresented below, on an after-tax basis, are the key factors impacting Dominion Energy's net income contribution:\nACQUISITION OF DOMINION QUESTAR\n\n An analysis of Virginia Power's results of operations follows:\n \u2022 Decreased charges related to future ash pond and landfill closure costs at certain utility generation facilities; \nDominion obtains from third-party specialists periodic site-specific base year cost studies in order to estimate the nature, cost and timing of planned decommissioning activities for its nuclear plants. These cost studies are based on relevant information available at the time they are performed; however, estimates of future cash flows for extended periods of time are by nature highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. In addition, Dominion's cost estimates include cost escalation rates that are applied to the base year costs. Dominion determines cost escalation rates, which represent projected cost increases over time due to both general inflation and increases in the cost of specific decommissioning activities, for each nuclear facility. The selection of these cost escalation rates is dependent on subjective factors which are considered to be critical assumptions.\n 41 \nEMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\nIn December 2012, the EPA issued a final rule that set a more stringent annual air quality standard for fine particulate matter. The EPA issued final attainment/nonattainment designations in January 2015. Until states develop their implementation plans, Dominion cannot determine whether or how facilities located in areas designated nonattainment for the standard will be impacted, but does not expect such impacts to be material.\n \u2022 Changes in rules for RTOs and ISOs in which Dominion and Virginia Power participate, including changes in rate designs, changes in FERC's interpretation of market rules and new and evolving capacity models; \nFinancing Cash Flows and Liquidity\nA downgrade in an individual company's credit rating does not necessarily restrict its ability to raise short-term and long-term financing as long as its credit rating remains investment grade, but it could result in an increase in the cost of borrowing. Dominion works closely with Fitch, Moody's and Standard & Poor's with the objective of achieving its targeted credit ratings. Dominion may find it necessary to modify its business plan to maintain or achieve appropriate credit ratings and such changes may adversely affect growth and EPS.\n \u2022 Segment Results of Operations \nfrom existing sources in the oil and natural gas sectors. In November 2016, the EPA issued an Information Collection Request to collect information on existing sources upstream of local distribution companies in this sector. Depending on the results of this Information Collection Request, the EPA may propose new regulations on existing sources. Dominion cannot currently estimate the potential impacts on results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows related to this matter.\nNet cash provided by Dominion's financing activities increased $3.9 billion, primarily reflecting higher net debt issuances and higher issuances of common stock and Dominion Midstream common and convertible preferred units in connection with the Dominion Questar Combination.\n (4) The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 16% of the total net credit exposure. \nNet income attributable to Dominion increased 45%, primarily due to the absence of charges associated with Virginia legislation enacted in April 2014 relating to the development of a third nuclear unit located at North Anna and offshore wind facilities, the absence of losses related to the repositioning of Dominion's producer services business in the first quarter of 2014, and the absence of charges related to Dominion's Liability Management Exercise. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on legislation related to North Anna and offshore wind facilities. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information on the Liability Management Exercise.\n \u2022 A decrease due to a charge based on the 2015 Biennial Review Order to refund revenues to customers ($20 million). \nNet revenue increased 3%, primarily reflecting:\nIn November 2015, Dominion issued $400 million of private placement short-term notes that matured in May 2016 and bore interest at a variable rate. In December 2015, Dominion issued an additional $200 million of the variable rate short-term notes that matured in May 2016. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.\n \u2022 Historical return analysis to determine long term historic returns as well as historic risk premiums for various asset classes; \n\n2016 VS. 2015\nDominion determines discount rates from analyses of AA/Aa rated bonds with cash flows matching the expected payments to be made under its plans. The discount rates used to calculate pension cost and other postretirement benefit cost ranged from 2.87% to 4.99% for pension plans and 3.56% to 4.94% for other postretirement benefit plans in 2016, were 4.40% in 2015,\nPresented below are operating statistics related to DVP's operations:\n \u2022 Extreme weather events and other natural disasters, including hurricanes, high winds, severe storms, earthquakes, flooding and changes in water temperatures and availability that can cause outages and property damage to facilities; \n \u2022 Risks associated with the operation of nuclear facilities, including costs associated with the disposal of spent nuclear fuel, decommissioning, plant maintenance and changes in existing regulations governing such facilities; \n \u2022 Changes in financial or regulatory accounting principles or policies imposed by governing bodies; \nInterest and related charges increased 12%, primarily due to higher long-term debt interest expense resulting from debt issuances in 2016 ($134 million), partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest associated with the Cove Point Liquefaction Project ($45 million).\n\n \u2022 A $46 million net increase due to services performed for Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Blue Racer. These expenses are billed to these entities and do not significantly impact net income; and \nDominion executed RCCs in connection with its issuance of the following hybrid securities:\nNet income increased 12%, primarily due to the new PJM capacity performance market effective June 2016, an increase in rate adjustment clause revenue and the absence of a write-off of deferred fuel costs associated with the Virginia legislation enacted in February 2015. These increases were partially offset by charges related to future ash pond and landfill closure costs at certain utility generation facilities.\nNet cash provided by Dominion's operating activities decreased $348 million, primarily due to higher operations and maintenance expenses, derivative activities, and increased payments for income taxes and interest. The decrease was partially offset with the benefit from the new PJM capacity performance market and higher deferred fuel cost recoveries and revenues from rate adjustment clauses in its Virginia jurisdiction.\n 57 \n \u2022 June 2009 hybrids.  In October 2014, Dominion redeemed all of the June 2009 hybrids. The redemption was conducted in compliance with the RCC. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, including terms of the RCCs.\n \u2022 Construction and operation of growth projects in gas transmission and distribution. \n\nrealized. At December 31, 2016, Dominion had established $135 million of valuation allowances.\n \u2022 An increase in depreciation, depletion, and amortization; \nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nNet income decreased 11%, primarily due to the absence of gains on the indirect sale of assets to Blue Racer, a decrease in income from NGL activities and higher interest expense, partially offset by increased gains from agreements to convey shale development rights underneath several natural gas storage fields.\n \u2022 Dominion \n \u2022 Timing and receipt of regulatory approvals necessary for planned construction or expansion projects and compliance with conditions associated with such regulatory approvals; \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nDominion is subject to costs resulting from a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect human health and the environment. These laws and regulations affect future planning and existing operations. They can result in increased capital, operating and other costs as a result of compliance, remediation, containment and monitoring obligations.\nACCOUNTING FOR REGULATED OPERATIONS\nImpairment testing for an individual or group of long-lived assets or for intangible assets with definite lives is required when circumstances indicate those assets may be impaired. When an asset's carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered impaired to the extent that the asset's fair value is less than its carrying amount. Performing an impairment test on long-lived assets involves judgment in areas such as identifying if circumstances indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets, and developing the undiscounted and discounted estimated future cash flows (used to estimate fair value in the absence of market-based value) associated with the asset, including probability weighting such cash flows to reflect expectations about possible variations in their amounts or timing, expectations about operating the long-lived assets and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. When determining whether an asset or asset group has been impaired, management groups assets at the lowest level that has identifiable cash flows. Although cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. For example, estimates of future cash flows would contemplate factors which may change over time, such as the expected use of the asset, including future production and sales levels, expected fluctuations of prices of commodities sold and consumed and expected proceeds from dispositions. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of impairments related to certain long-lived assets.\nIn September 2016, Dominion borrowed $1.2 billion under a term loan agreement that bore interest at a variable rate. The net proceeds were used to finance the Dominion Questar Combination. In December 2016, the loan was repaid with cash received from Dominion Midstream in connection with the contribution of Questar Pipeline. The loan would have otherwise matured in September 2017. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nFUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS\n \u2022 A $38 million decrease in planned outage costs primarily due to a decrease in scheduled outage days at certain non-nuclear utility generation facilities. \n \u2022 A $43 million increase from regulated natural gas distribution operations, primarily due to an increase in AMR and PIR program revenues ($24 million) and various expansion projects placed into service ($22 million); partially offset by \n \u2022 Forward-Looking Statements \n (2) Represents the portion of earnings attributable to Dominion Midstream's public unitholders.

Until the states have developed implementation plans for these standards, the impact on Dominion's facilities that emit NOX and SO2 is uncertain. Additionally, the impact of permit limits for implementing NAAQS on Dominion's facilities is uncertain at this time.\nDOMINION GAS\nPresented below are the Corporate and Other segment's after-tax results:\nAnalysis of Consolidated Operations\n\nIn April 2016, the labor contract between Dominion and Local 69 expired. In August 2016, the parties reached a tentative agreement for a new labor contract, however, the agreement was not submitted to members of Local 69 for approval. In September 2016, following a temporary lock out of union members, Local 69 agreed to not strike at DTI and Hope at least through April 1, 2017. In exchange, DTI and Hope agreed to recall the union members to work and not lock them out during that period. Contract negotiations resumed in October 2016 and are continuing. Local 69 represents approximately 760 DTI employees in West Virginia, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Virginia and approximately 150 Hope employees in West Virginia.\n \u2022 A $97 million decrease in planned outage costs primarily due to a decrease in scheduled outage days at certain merchant generation facilities ($59 million) and non-nuclear utility generation facilities ($38 million); and \n (3) Primarily consists of operating leases. \nIncome tax expense increased 20%, primarily reflecting higher pre-tax income.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet revenue increased 10%, primarily reflecting:\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016, Dominion Midstream received $482 million of proceeds from the issuance of common units and $490 million of proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred units. The net proceeds were primarily used to finance a portion of the acquisition of Questar Pipeline from Dominion. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nDominion Energy\n (2) Securities have an interest deferral feature. \n \u2022 A higher effective tax rate, driven primarily by a decrease in investment tax credits; and \n \u2022 A $12 million decrease from regulated natural gas distribution operations, primarily due to a decrease in rate adjustment clause revenue related to low income assistance programs ($26 million) and a decrease in sales to customers due to a reduction in heating degree days ($6 million), partially offset by an increase in AMR and PIR program revenues ($18 million). \n \u2022 Additional competition in industries in which the Companies operate, including in electric markets in which Dominion's merchant generation facilities operate and potential competition from the development and deployment of alternative energy sources, such as self-generation and distributed generation technologies, and availability of market alternatives to large commercial and industrial customers; \n \u2022 A $53 million increase in utility nuclear refueling outage costs primarily due to the amortization of outage costs that were previously deferred pursuant to Virginia legislation enacted in April 2014; \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nAs of February 23, 2017, Fitch, Moody's, and Standard & Poor's maintained a stable outlook for their respective ratings of Dominion.\n \u2022 Decreased transaction and transition costs associated with the Dominion Questar Combination; \n \u2022 The absence of losses related to the repositioning of Dominion's producer services business in the first quarter of 2014, reflecting the termination of natural gas trading and certain energy marketing activities ($313 million); \nSee Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n \u2022 A decrease in sales to customers due to the effect of changes in customer usage and other factors ($24 million); and \n \u2022 Limitations on liens.  Dominion is required to pay annual commitment fees to maintain its credit facilities. In addition, Dominion's credit agreements contain various terms and conditions that could affect its ability to borrow under these facilities. They include maximum debt to total capital ratios and cross-default provisions.\nDominion expects to fund its capital expenditures with cash from operations and a combination of securities issuances and short-term borrowings. Planned capital expenditures include capital projects that are subject to approval by regulators and the Board of Directors.\n2015 VS. 2014\nEnvironmental Matters\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nLIABILITY MANAGEMENT\n \u2022 A $30 million increase from regulated natural gas transmission operations, primarily reflecting: \n \u2022 A $78 million decrease in gains from agreements to convey shale development rights underneath several natural gas storage fields; and \n \u2022 A $225 million electric capacity benefit, primarily due to the new PJM capacity performance market effective June 2016 ($155 million) and the expiration of non-utility generator contracts in 2015 ($58 million); \nIn 2016, 2015 and 2014, Dominion recognized $104 million, $93 million and $81 million, respectively, of accretion, and expects to recognize $117 million in 2017. Dominion records accretion and depreciation associated with utility nuclear decommissioning AROs and regulated pipeline replacement\n \u2022 A $26 million decrease in bad debt expense at regulated natural gas distribution operations primarily related to low income assistance programs. These bad debt expenses are recovered through rates and do not impact net income.  Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased 12%, primarily due to various expansion projects being placed into service.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n 45 \nDominion believes that its operations provide a stable source of cash flow to contribute to planned levels of capital expenditures and maintain or grow the dividend on common shares. In December 2016, Dominion's Board of Directors established an annual dividend rate for 2017 of $3.02 per share of common stock, a 7.9% increase over the 2016 rate. Dividends are subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. In January 2017, Dominion's Board of Directors declared dividends payable in March 2017 of 75.5 cents per share of common stock.\n2016 VS. 2015\nalternative plans that represent plausible compliance strategies with the rule as proposed, and which include additional coal unit retirements and additional low or zero-carbon resources. The final rule has been challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. In February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay of the Clean Power Plan until the disposition of the petitions challenging the rule now before the Court of Appeals, and, if such petitions are filed in the future, before the U.S. Supreme Court. Dominion does not know whether these legal challenges will impact the submittal deadlines for the state implementation plans. In June 2016, the Governor of Virginia signed an executive order directing the Virginia Natural Resources Secretary to convene a workgroup charged with recommending concrete steps to reduce carbon pollution which include the Clean Power Plan as an option. Unless the rule survives the court challenges and until the state plans are developed and the EPA approves the plans, Dominion cannot predict the potential financial statement impacts but believes the potential expenditures to comply could be material.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n Dominion Generation\n \u2022 Forward-looking return expectations derived from the yield on long-term bonds and the expected long-term returns of major stock market indices; and \nVS. 2015\nDuring 2016, Dominion issued 4.2 million shares of common stock totaling $314 million through employee savings plans, direct stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plans and other employee and director benefit plans. Dominion received cash proceeds of $295 million from the issuance of 4.0 million of such shares through Dominion Direct\u00ae and employee savings plans.\n \u2022 An $18 million decrease from NGL activities, due to decreased prices ($16 million) and volumes ($2 million); partially offset by \nAs of December 31, 2016, Dominion reported $6.4 billion of goodwill in its Consolidated Balance Sheet. A significant portion resulted from the acquisition of the former CNG in 2000 and the Dominion Questar Combination in 2016.\n (1) Securities do not have an interest deferral feature. \n \u2022 In December 2016, Questar Gas issued $50 million of 3.62% private placement senior notes, and $50 million of 3.67% private placement senior notes, that mature in 2046 and 2051, respectively. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. \nLegal Matters\n\n \u2022 A $2 million increase in gas transportation and storage activities, primarily due to decreased fuel costs ($24 million) and various expansion projects placed into service ($24 million), partially offset by decreased regulated gas sales ($46 million); and \n \u2022 Political and economic conditions, including inflation and deflation; \n \u2022 A decrease due to a charge based on the 2015 Biennial Review Order to refund revenues to customers ($20 million). \nInterest and related charges decreased 24%, primarily as a result of the absence of charges associated with Dominion's Liability Management Exercise in 2014.\nDominion\nassumptions and actual experience, is generally recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the remaining average service period of plan participants, rather than immediately.\nCredit Ratings\nMD&A consists of the following information:\nA key element of the initial U.S. nationally determined contributions of achieving a 26% to 28% reduction below 2005 levels by 2025 is the implementation of the Clean Power Plan, which establishes interim emission reduction targets for fossil fuel-fired electric generating units over the period 2022 through 2029 with final targets to be achieved by 2030. The EPA estimates that the Clean Power Plan will result in a nationwide reduction in CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units of 32% from 2005 levels by 2030.\n \u2022 Federal, state and local legislative and regulatory developments, including changes in federal and state tax laws and regulations; \n \u2022 A $50 million increase in storm damage and service restoration costs, including $23 million for Hurricane Matthew; \n (4) Excludes 511 thousand average retail electric energy marketing customer accounts due to the sale of this business in March 2014. \nASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS\n \u2022 A $22 million increase due to the acquisition of DCG.

The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes and to repay short-term debt, including commercial paper. \nIncome tax expense increased 100%, primarily reflecting higher pre-tax income.\n \u2022 Changes in implementation and enforcement practices of regulators relating to environmental standards and litigation exposure for remedial activities; \nAs part of borrowing funds and issuing debt (both short-term and long-term) or preferred securities, Dominion must enter into enabling agreements. These agreements contain covenants that, in the event of default, could result in the acceleration of principal and interest payments; restrictions on distributions related to capital stock, including dividends, redemptions, repurchases, liquidation payments or guarantee payments; and in some cases, the termination of credit commitments unless a waiver of such requirements is agreed to by the lenders/security holders. These provisions are customary, with each agreement specifying which covenants apply. These provisions are not necessarily unique to Dominion.\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\n (1) Includes Dominion Questar effective September 2016. \n (2) The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 10% of the total net credit exposure. \n (3) Includes Dominion Questar customer accounts for the entire year. \nDuring 2016, Dominion issued the following long-term public debt:\n Dominion monitors these debt covenants on a regular basis in order to ensure that events of default will not occur. As of December 31, 2016, there have been no events of default under Dominion's debt covenants.\nIncome tax expense decreased 15% primarily reflecting lower pre-tax income.\n \u2022 In March 2016 and May 2016, Dominion successfully remarketed the $550 million 2013 Series A 1.07% RSNs due 2021 and the $550 million 2013 Series B 1.18% RSNs due 2019, respectively, pursuant to the terms of the related 2013 Equity Units. In connection with the remarketings, the interest rates on the Series A and Series B junior subordinated notes were reset to 4.104% and 2.962%, respectively. Dominion did not receive any proceeds from the remarketings. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. \nCredit ratings as of February 23, 2017 follow:\nDominion's 2017 net income is expected to remain substantially consistent on a per share basis as compared to 2016.\nDominion did not repurchase any shares in 2016 and does not plan to repurchase shares during 2017, except for shares tendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations on vested restricted stock, which does not count against its stock repurchase authorization.\n\n \u2022 A $19 million decrease from regulated natural gas transmission operations, primarily due to: \nPresented below are selected amounts related to Dominion's results of operations:\nIncome tax expense decreased 24% primarily reflecting lower pre-tax income.\n TOTAL SPECIFIC ITEMS\n \u2022 June 2006 hybrids; \nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n \u2022 A $61 million decrease from NGL activities, primarily due to decreased prices.  Other operations and maintenance decreased 6%, primarily reflecting:\n \u2022 A $47 million decrease from merchant generation operations, primarily due to lower realized prices at certain merchant generation facilities ($64 million) and an increase in planned and unplanned outage days in 2016 ($26 million), partially offset by additional solar generating facilities placed into service ($37 million); \n Overview\n \u2022 In December 2016, Dominion issued $250 million of private placement 1.875% senior notes that mature in 2018. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes and to repay short-term debt, including commercial paper.  During 2016, Dominion also remarketed the following long-term debt:\n (4) Amounts exclude open purchase orders for services that are provided on demand, the timing of which cannot be determined. \n \u2022 Adverse outcomes in litigation matters or regulatory proceedings; and \n \u2022 An increase from rate adjustment clauses ($225 million); \nCREDIT RISK\n2016 issuance of $1.3 billion of senior notes, (3) September 2016 borrowing of $1.2 billion under a term loan agreement, which was repaid with cash received from Dominion Midstream in connection with the contribution of Questar Pipeline and (4) $500 million of the proceeds from the April 2016 issuance of common stock.\n \u2022 An increase from rate adjustment clauses ($225 million); \nGiven the uncertainty and judgment involved in the determination and filing of income taxes, there are standards for recognition and measurement in financial statements of positions taken or expected to be taken by an entity in its income tax returns. Positions taken by an entity in its income tax returns that are recognized in the financial statements must satisfy a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, assuming that the position will be examined by tax authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information.

investment tax credits and the new PJM capacity performance market. \n\n- Operating revenue increased 1% in 2016 compared to 2015 for Dominion, driven by an increase from rate adjustment clauses and higher regulated electric sales.\n\n- Capital expenditures are expected to total $5.8 billion in 2017 and $5.0 billion in 2018, primarily for construction and expansion of electric generation and gas facilities, electric transmission and distribution assets, and the Cove Point Liquefaction project.  \n\n- Net income increased 27% for Virginia Power in 2016 compared to 2015, mainly due to the absence of charges associated with previous Virginia legislation related to a nuclear unit and offshore wind facilities.\n\n- Net income decreased 14% for Dominion Gas in 2016 versus 2015, largely due to lower gains from agreements to convey shale development rights.\n\n- Goodwill totaled $6.4 billion at December 31, 2016, with a significant portion from the acquisition of CNG in 2000 and the Dominion Questar Combination in 2016. \n\n- Debt covenants related to maximum debt levels and other terms were in compliance and did not restrict dividend payments as of December 31, 2016.\n\n- Credit rating agencies maintained a stable outlook for Dominion's ratings in 2016. \n\nIn summary, the MD&A discusses Dominion's 2016 financial performance, capital spending plans, regulatory and legal matters, credit profile, and outlook for 2017. Key operational and financial metrics are provided for Dominion's business segments."}
