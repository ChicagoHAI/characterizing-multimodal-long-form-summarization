Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Item 6 - Selected Financial Data\u201d and the accompanying consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. The forward-looking statements are dependent upon events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, market prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs, production volumes, estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves, mineral acquisition capital, economic and competitive conditions, regulatory changes and other uncertainties, as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d all of which are difficult to predict. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed may not occur. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements except as otherwise required by applicable law.\nOverview\nBrigham Minerals was formed to acquire and actively manage a portfolio of mineral and royalty interests in the core of what we view as the most active, highly economic, liquids-rich resource plays across the continental United States. Our primary business objective is to maximize risk-adjusted total return to our shareholders through (i) the growth of our free cash flow generated from our existing portfolio of approximately 86,285 net royalty acres, and (ii) the continued sourcing and execution of accretive mineral acquisitions in the core of highly economic, liquids-rich resource plays. As of December 31, 2020, we owned 86,285 net royalty acres across 37 counties within the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico, the SCOOP/\nSTACK plays in the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma, the DJ Basin in Colorado and Wyoming and the Williston Basin in North Dakota.\nFinancial and Operational Overview:\n\u2022Our production volumes increased 28%, to 9,483 Boe/d (72% liquids, 53% oil), for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the prior year.\n\u2022Our mineral and royalty revenues composed of crude oil, natural gas and NGL sales decreased 12%, to $86.2 million, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the prior year.\n\u2022Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $58.0 million. Adjusted Net Income was $7.1 million, excluding an after-tax impairment to oil and gas properties of $65.1 million. Our net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was $21.6 million, while Adjusted Net Income was $27.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ex lease bonus decreased 17% to $65.0 million, and 20% to $59.6 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the prior year. Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ex lease bonus are non-GAAP financial measures. For a definition of Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ex lease bonus and a reconciliation to our most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, please read \"How We Evaluate Our Operations-Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Ex Lease Bonus.\"\n\u2022On February 19, 2021, the Board of Directors of Brigham Minerals declared a dividend of $0.26 per share of Class A common stock payable on March 26, 2021 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 19, 2021.This brings the total capital returned to shareholders related to financial results from fiscal year 2020 to $1.01 per share.\n\u2022As of December 31, 2020, Brigham Minerals had a cash balance of $9.1 million and $115.0 million of capacity on our revolving credit facility, providing the Company with total liquidity of $124.1 million.\nMarket Environment and COVID-19\nThe ongoing global spread of a novel strain of coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2), which causes COVID-19, has caused a continuing disruption to the oil and natural gas industry and to our business by, among other things, contributing to a significant decrease in demand for crude oil and the price for oil beginning in the first quarter of 2020 and continuing through the fourth quarter of 2020. Additionally, in March 2020, Saudi Arabia and Russia failed to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls within OPEC and Russia. Subsequently, Saudi Arabia announced plans to increase production and reduce the prices at which they sell oil. While OPEC+ subsequently agreed to collectively decrease production, these events, combined with the macro-economic impact of the continued outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and declining availability of hydrocarbon storage, exacerbated the decline in commodity prices, including the historic, record low price of negative ($36.98) per barrel that occurred in April 2020. Additionally, in July 2020, OPEC+ agreed to begin easing production cuts starting in August 2020. Market volatility has continued, and we expect it will continue for the foreseeable future. Please see Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d for further discussion of these events.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the potential risk to our workforce and in compliance with stay at home orders, we successfully implemented policies and the technological infrastructure for all of our employees to work from home in the first quarter of 2020 and ceased all business travel. In compliance with the requirements for the re-opening of the Texas economy, we are currently operating our office at 75% capacity while continuing to support working from home for our employees that are considered high-risk pursuant to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines or have household members meeting the criteria of the guidelines. Due to these efforts, we have not experienced material disruptions to our operations or the health of our workforce.\nThe declining commodity prices have adversely affected the revenues we receive for our royalty interests and could affect our ability to access the capital markets on terms favorable to us. Additionally, in response to the declining commodity prices, many operators on our properties substantially reduced their capital expenditures during 2020 and have announced similarly reduced capital expenditures for 2021 and beyond, which has adversely affected the development of our properties and will continue to affect the development of our properties into 2021 and beyond. While these lower commodity prices initially resulted in some of the Company's operators shutting in or curtailing production from wells on its properties during the second quarter of 2020, the Company saw a majority of its operators resume production for previously curtailed and shut in wells in connection with the improvement of commodity prices in the third and fourth quarters of 2020. As a result of the shut-ins in the second quarter of 2020 and the depressed commodity prices, our revenues, cash flows from operations and dividend amounts\nwe are able to pay our stockholders have continued to be negatively impacted. We cannot predict the extent and duration of these and other impacts on our business from the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts to fight the pandemic and other market events.\nIn connection with the previously mentioned COVID-19 pandemic and resulting market and commodity price challenges experienced during 2020, we saw reduced levels of potential acquisition opportunities, which could potentially delay our ability to execute on our growth strategy. With an improvement in commodity prices along with our financial strength, we are well positioned to capture attractive opportunities in 2021 that will generate shareholder value. Given that our capital allocation is within our control, we believe that the liquidity provided by our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will provide us with sufficient capital to execute our current strategy.\nOperational Update\nMineral and Royalty Interest Ownership Update\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company completed 81 transactions acquiring 4,635 net royalty acres (standardized to a 1/8th royalty interest) for $66.5 million, in the Permian, SCOOP/STACK/Merge, Williston and DJ Basins. The Company deployed approximately 92% of its mineral acquisition capital in 2020 to the Permian Basin (70% Delaware and 22% Midland), 4% to the Anadarko Basin, 2% to the Williston Basin and 2% to the DJ Basin. The acquired minerals are expected to deliver near-term production and cash flow growth with the addition of 165 gross DUCs (0.6 net DUCs) and 97 gross permits (0.3 net permits) to our inventory counts. As of December 31, 2020, the Company owned roughly 86,285 net royalty acres, encompassing 13,496 gross (116.3 net) undeveloped horizontal locations, across 37 counties in what the Company views as the core of the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico, the SCOOP/STACK plays in the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma, the DJ Basin in Colorado and Wyoming and the Williston Basin in North Dakota.\nThe

the Company identified approximately 628 gross DUCs (4.7 net DUCs) converted to production, representing 70% of its gross DUC inventory (79% of its net DUCs) as of year-end 2019. 2020 conversions of gross wells by status are summarized in the graph below:\nDrilling Activity\nDuring 2020 the Company saw 381 gross (2.6 net) wells spud on its acreage. 54% of gross (70% net) wells spud were in the Permian Basin, with 35% gross (60% net) wells spud in the Delaware Basin and 19% gross (10% net) wells spud in the Midland Basin:\nDUC and Permit Inventory\nThe Company expects any near-term

Among the measures considered by management are the following:\n\u2022volumes of oil, natural gas and NGLs produced;\n\u2022number of rigs on location, permits, spuds, completions and wells turned-in-line;\n\u2022commodity prices; and\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ex lease bonus.\nVolumes of Oil, Natural Gas and NGLs Produced\nIn order to track and assess the performance of our assets, we monitor and analyze our production volumes from the various resource plays that comprise our portfolio of mineral and royalty interests. We also regularly compare projected volumes to actual reported volumes and investigate unexpected variances.\nNumber of Rigs on Location, Permits, Spuds, Completions and Wells Turned-In-Line\nIn order to track and assess the performance of our assets, we monitor and analyze the number of rigs currently drilling our properties. We also constantly monitor the number of permits, spuds, completions and wells on production that are applicable to our mineral and royalty interests in an effort to evaluate near-term production growth from the various basins and resource plays that comprise our asset base.\nCommodity Prices\nHistorically, oil, natural gas and NGL prices have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. During the past five years, the posted price for WTI has ranged from a historic, record low price of negative ($36.98) per barrel in April 2020 to a high of $77.41 per barrel in June 2018. The Henry Hub spot market price for natural gas has ranged from a low of $1.33 per MMBtu in September 2020 to a high of $6.24 per MMBtu in January 2018. As of December 31, 2020, the posted price for oil was $48.35 per barrel and the Henry Hub spot market price of natural gas was $2.36 per MMBtu. Lower prices may not only decrease our revenues, but also potentially the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs that our operators can produce economically.\nThe prices we receive for oil, natural gas and NGLs vary by geographical area. The relative prices of these products are determined by factors affecting global and regional supply and demand dynamics, such as economic and geopolitical conditions, production levels, availability of transportation, weather cycles and other factors. In addition, realized prices are influenced by product quality and proximity to consuming and refining markets. Any differences between realized prices and NYMEX prices are referred to as differentials. All of our production is derived from properties located in the United States.\nOil. The substantial majority of our oil production is sold at prevailing market prices, which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of our control. NYMEX light sweet crude oil, commonly referred to as WTI, is the prevailing domestic oil pricing index. The majority of our oil production is priced at the prevailing market price with the final realized price affected by both quality and location differentials.\nThe chemical composition of crude oil plays an important role in its refining and subsequent sale as petroleum products. As a result, variations in chemical composition relative to the benchmark crude oil, usually WTI, will result in price adjustments, which are often referred to as quality differentials. The characteristics that most significantly affect quality differentials include the density of the oil, as characterized by its API gravity, and the presence and concentration of impurities, such as sulfur.\nLocation differentials generally result from transportation costs based on the produced oil's proximity to consuming and refining markets and major trading points.\nNatural Gas. The NYMEX price quoted at Henry Hub is a widely used benchmark for the pricing of natural gas in the United States. The actual volumetric prices realized from the sale of natural gas differ from the quoted NYMEX price as a result of quality and location differentials.\nQuality differentials result from the heating value of natural gas measured in Btus and the presence of impurities, such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide and nitrogen. Natural gas containing ethane and heavier hydrocarbons has a higher Btu value and will realize a higher volumetric price than natural gas that is predominantly methane, which has a lower Btu value. Natural gas with a higher concentration of impurities will realize a lower volumetric price due to the presence of the impurities in the natural gas when sold or the cost of treating the natural gas to meet pipeline quality specifications.\nNatural gas, which currently has a limited global transportation system, is subject to price variances based on local supply and demand conditions and the cost to transport natural gas to end-user markets.\nNGLs. NGL pricing is generally tied to the price of oil, but varies based on differences in liquid components and location.\nOil and Gas Properties\nUnder the full cost method of accounting, total capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated depletion and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount equal to the present value of future net revenues from proved reserves, discounted at 10% per annum (\"PV-10\"), plus the cost of unevaluated properties, less related income tax effects (full cost ceiling limitation). A write-down of the carrying value of the full cost pool (\"impairment charge\") is a noncash charge that reduces earnings and impacts equity in the period of occurrence and typically results in lower depletion expense in future periods. A ceiling limitation is calculated at each reporting period. The ceiling limitation calculation is prepared using an unweighted arithmetic average of oil prices (\"SEC oil price\") and natural gas prices (\"SEC gas price\") as of the first day of each month for the trailing 12-month period ended, as required under the guidelines established by the SEC. As of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the SEC oil prices were $39.57, $55.65, and $65.66, respectively, per barrel for oil, adjusted by area for energy content, transportation fees and regional price differentials, and the SEC gas prices were $2.00, $2.60, and $3.12, respectively, per MMBtu for natural gas, adjusted by area for energy content, transportation fees and regional price differentials. As a result of the decline in the SEC oil prices and the SEC gas prices during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, and taking into consideration certain reclassifications of proved undeveloped reserves to probable and possible reserves during the three months ended December 31, 2020, as a result of a slowdown in operator activity, the net book value of oil and natural gas properties exceeded the ceiling limitation, as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020, resulting in an impairment charge of $79.6 million to oil and gas properties, net during the year ended December 31, 2020. There were no impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nFurther declines in the SEC oil price or the SEC gas price could lead to additional impairment charges in the future and such impairment charges could be material. In addition to the impact of lower prices, any future changes to assumptions of drilling and completion activity, development timing, acquisitions or divestitures of oil and gas properties, proved undeveloped locations, and production and other estimates may require revisions to estimates of total proved reserves which would impact the amount of any impairment charge. Based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development activities, production data, economics and other factors, we may be required to write down the carrying value of our properties in future periods. The risk that we will be required to recognize impairments of our oil, natural gas and NGL properties increases during sustained periods of low commodity prices. In addition, impairments could occur if we were to experience sufficient downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or the present value of estimated future net revenues. If we incur impairment charges in the future, our results of operations for the periods in which such charges are taken may be materially and adversely affected.\nHedging\nWe may enter into certain derivative instruments to partially mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility on our cash flow generated from operations. From time to time, such instruments may include variable-to-fixed-price swaps, fixed-price contracts, costless collars and other contractual arrangements. The impact of these derivative instruments could affect the amount of cash flows we ultimately realize. Historically, we have only entered into minimal fixed-price swap contracts. Under fixed-price swap contracts, a counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price is less than the swap strike price. Conversely, we are required to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price is greater than the swap strike price. We may employ contractual arrangements other than fixed-price swap contracts in the future to mitigate the impact of price fluctuations. If commodity prices decline in the future, our hedging contracts may partially mitigate the effect of lower prices on our future revenue.\nOur revolving credit facility allows us to hedge up to 85% of our reasonably anticipated projected production from our proved reserves of oil and natural gas, calculated separately, for up to 60 months in the future. We did not have any natural gas or oil derivative contracts in place as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded a loss on commodity derivative instruments, net of $0.6 million and a gain of $0.4 million, respectively. See Note 5-Derivative Instruments\u201d to the consolidated and combined financial statements of Brigham Minerals included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Ex Lease Bonus\nAdjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ex lease bonus are non-GAAP supplemental financial measures used by our management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors, research analysts and others to assess the financial performance of our assets and their ability to sustain dividends over the long term without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis.\nWe define Adjusted Net Income as net income (loss) before impairment of oil and gas properties, after tax, and loss on extinguishment of debt, after tax. We define Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted Net Income before depreciation, depletion and amortization, share based compensation expense, interest expense, gain or loss on derivative instruments and income tax\nexpense, less other income, gain on sale of oil and gas properties and income tax benefit. We define Adjusted EBITDA ex lease bonus as Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted to eliminate the impacts of lease bonus revenue we receive due to the unpredictability of timing and magnitude of the revenue.\nAdjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ex lease bonus do not represent and should not be considered alternatives to, or more meaningful than, net income, income from operations, cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP as measures of our financial performance. Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ex lease bonus have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Our computation of Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ex lease bonus may differ from computations of similarly titled measures of other companies. For further discussion, please read Item 6 - Selected Financial Data-Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\nSources of Our Revenues\nOur revenues are primarily derived from the mineral and royalty payments we receive from our operators based on the sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs produced from our properties, as well as from lease bonus payments. Mineral and royalty revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in volumes of production sold by our operators, production mix and commodity prices. Lease bonus revenues vary from period to period as a result of leasing activity on our mineral interests.\nThe following table presents the breakdown of our revenues for the following periods:\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mineral and royalty revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Oil sales </td> <td>74 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>81 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>70 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas sales </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NGL sales </td> <td>9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total mineral and royalty revenues </td> <td>94 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>96 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>89 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease bonus revenue </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPrinciple Components of Our Cost Structure\nThe following is a description of the principle components of our cost structure. However, as an owner of mineral and royalty interests, we are not obligated to fund drilling and completion capital expenditures to bring a horizontal well on line, lease operating expenses to produce our oil, natural gas and NGLs nor the plugging and abandonment costs at the end of a well's economic life. All the aforementioned costs are borne entirely by the exploration and production companies that have leased our mineral and royalty interests.\nGathering, Transportation and Marketing Expenses\nGathering, transportation and marketing expenses include the costs to process and transport our production to applicable sales points. Generally, the terms of the lease governing the development of our properties permits the operator to pass through these expenses to us by deducting a pro rata portion of such expenses from our production revenues.\nSeverance and Ad Valorem Taxes\nSeverance taxes are paid on produced oil, natural gas or NGLs based on either a percentage of revenues from production sold or the number of units of production sold at fixed rates established by federal, state or local taxing authorities. In general, the production taxes we pay correlate to changes in our oil, natural gas and NGL revenues, which is driven by our production volumes and prices received for our oil, natural gas and NGLs. We are also subject to ad valorem taxes in some of the counties where our production is located. Ad valorem taxes are generally based on the state or local government's appraisal of the value of our oil, natural gas and NGL properties, which also trend with anticipated production, as well as oil, natural gas and NGL prices. Rates, methods of calculating property values and timing of payments vary across the different counties in which we own mineral and royalty interests.\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization ( DD&A\u201d) is the systematic expensing of the capitalized costs incurred to acquire evaluated oil and natural gas properties. We use the full cost method of accounting, and, as such, all acquisition-related costs to acquire evaluated properties are capitalized and amortized in aggregate based on the estimated economic productive lives of our properties. Depletion is the expense recorded based on the cost basis of our properties and the volume of hydrocarbons extracted during each respective period, calculated on a units-of-production basis. Estimates of proved reserves are a major component of our calculation of depletion. We adjust our depletion rates quarterly based upon the quarter-end internally generated reserve reports unless circumstances indicate that there has been a significant change in reserves or costs. The year-end reserve reports are audited by CG&A.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative ( G&A\u201d) expenses are costs incurred for overhead, including payroll and benefits for our staff, share-based compensation expense, costs of maintaining our headquarters, costs of managing our properties, audit and other fees for professional services and legal compliance. As a result of becoming a public company, we incurred incremental G&A expenses including, but not limited to, costs associated with hiring new personnel, implementation of compensation programs that are competitive with our public company peer group including share-based compensation, annual and quarterly reports to stockholders, tax return preparation, independent and internal auditor fees, investor relations activities, registrar and transfer agent fees, incremental director and officer liability insurance costs and independent director compensation. These incremental G&A expenses are not reflected in our historical financial statements before the IPO date.\nInterest Expense\nWe finance a portion of our working capital requirements and acquisitions with borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As a result, we incur interest expense that is affected by both fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions. We reflect interest paid to the lenders under our debt arrangements (currently, our revolving credit facility) in interest expense. In connection with the closing of our IPO, we fully repaid the outstanding borrowings under our Owl Rock credit facility. Please see Note 7-Long-Term Debt\u201d to the consolidated and combined financial statements of Brigham Minerals included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nIncome Tax Expense\nBrigham Minerals is subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes as a corporation. Texas imposes a franchise tax (commonly referred to as the Texas margin tax) at a rate of up to 1.00% on gross revenues less certain deductions, as specifically set forth in the Texas margin tax statute. A portion of our mineral and royalty interests are located in Texas basins. Our predecessor was treated as a flow-through entity, and is currently treated as a disregarded entity, for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, is generally not subject to U.S. federal income tax at the entity level.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nThe following table provides the components of our revenues and expenses

commodity derivative transactions on our average sales prices. Our calculation of such effects include realized gains and losses on cash settlements for commodity derivatives, which we do not designate for hedge accounting.\n*** A percentage calculation is not meaningful due to change in signs, zero-value denominator or a change greater than 300.\nRevenues\nTotal revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by 10%, or $9.8 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was attributable to a $11.6 million decrease in mineral and royalty revenues during the period, partially offset by a $1.8 million increase in lease bonus revenue. The decrease in mineral and royalty revenues was primarily the result of a decrease in realized commodity prices of 31% resulting in a $39.3 million decrease in mineral and royalty revenues. This was partially offset by an increase in drilling and completion activity on our mineral and royalty interests, and to a lesser degree by acquisitions of proved developed producing reserves, which resulted in a 28% increase in production volumes to 9,483 Boe/d and a corresponding increase in mineral and royalty revenues of $27.7 million.\nOil revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by 17%, or $14.1 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in oil revenues was primarily attributable to the 31% decrease in realized oil price to $37.26 per barrel resulting in a decrease in revenue of $30.8 million. This was partially offset by a 20% increase in oil production volumes to 4,980 barrels per day resulting in a $16.7 million increase in oil revenues. The increase in oil production volumes for the period was primarily attributable to increased drilling and completion activity on our properties in the Permian Basin.\nNatural gas revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by 7%, or $0.7 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in natural gas revenues was primarily attributable to the 23% increase in natural gas production volume to 15,871 Mcf/d resulting in a $2.3 million increase in natural gas sales. The increase in natural gas production volumes for the period was primarily attributable to increased drilling and completion activity on our properties in the Permian Basin. This was partially offset by a 13% decrease in realized natural gas price to $1.80 per Mcf resulting in a decrease in revenue of $1.6 million.\nNGL revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by 29%, or $1.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in NGL revenues was primarily attributable to the 67% increase in NGL volumes to 1,858 Boe/d resulting in a $4.1 million increase in NGL sales was primarily attributable to increased drilling and completion activities on our properties in the Permian Basin. This was partially offset by a 23% decrease in NGL prices to $11.61 per barrel resulting in a decrease in revenue of $2.3 million.\nLease bonus revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by 51%, or $1.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in leasing activity on our interests in Texas, partially offset by a decrease in leasing activity in Colorado and Oklahoma. Other revenues include payments for right-of-way and surface damages and were not a significant portion of the overall amount.\nOperating and other expenses\nGathering, transportation, and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by 40%, or $2.0 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, which was largely driven by the 28% increase in our production volumes as well as an increase in gathering, transportation and marketing rates.\nSeverance and ad valorem taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by 13%, or $0.8 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the 12% decrease in mineral and royalty revenues.\nDD&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by 56%, or $17.3 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, which was primarily due to an increase in depletion expense of $17.0 million. Higher production volumes increased our depletion expense by $8.6 million, and a higher depletion rate increased our depletion expense by $8.4 million. The depletion rate was $13.63 per Boe and $11.22 per Boe for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in the depletion rate was a result of recent acquisition efforts focused on largely de-risked acreage with an increased likelihood of near-term production and development, as well as reclassification of proved undeveloped reserves to probable and possible reserves due to changes in assumptions of the development timing as a result of reduced activity by our operators. We adjust our depletion rates quarterly based upon the quarter-end internally generated reserve reports.\nAs of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020, the net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceeded the full cost ceiling limitation primarily due to the decline in oil and gas prices and reclassification of proved undeveloped reserves to probable and possible reserves during the three months ended December 31, 2020 as a result of a slowdown in operator activity. As a result, we recorded impairments of our oil and gas properties, net of $79.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nIn determining the full cost ceiling impairment at December 31, 2020, we estimated the PV-10 of our total proved oil and natural gas reserves using the SEC oil price and the SEC gas price of $39.57 per Bbl and $2.00 per MMBtu, respectively, which is a decrease of 29% and 23%, respectively, from the December 31, 2019 SEC oil price and SEC gas price of $55.65 per Bbl and $2.60 per MMBtu, respectively. No impairment charge was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nG&A for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by 18%, or $2.2 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Increases to G&A expense are a result of: (i) $0.7 million in incremental legal, professional, audit, and tax fees as a result of the Company's June 2020 Secondary Offering and September 2020 Secondary Offering, (ii) $0.5 million in additional rent expense, (iii) $0.4 million of incremental directors and officers insurance expenses, and (iv) $0.3 million of additional salaries due to an increase in headcount.\nShare-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by 25%, or $2.5 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in share-based compensation expense was due to a cumulative effect adjustment of $5.2 million pertaining to the period from the grant date to the IPO, which consists of a $2.0 million cumulative effect adjustment related to the estimated fair value of the Incentive Units and a $3.2 million cumulative effect adjustment related to the estimated fair value of the RSAs, partially offset by share-based compensation expense related to awards granted during the year ended December 31, 2020. Brigham Minerals capitalizes a portion of the share-based compensation cost incurred after the IPO.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, our weighted average debt outstanding on our revolving credit facility was $2.8 million compared to our weighted average debt outstanding on our Owl Rock credit facility and revolving credit facility combined of $55.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our weighted average interest was 1.91% and 7.29% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In May 2019, a portion of the net proceeds received from the IPO were used to fully repay the outstanding borrowings under the Owl Rock credit facility. In December 2019, a portion of the net proceeds received from the December 2019 Offering were used to fully repay the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility.

As a result of the full repayment of the outstanding balance of the Owl Rock credit facility of $200.0 million in May 2019, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $6.9 million for the\nyear ended December 31, 2019. The loss on extinguishment of debt consisted of a $4.0 million write-off of capitalized debt issuance costs, a $2.1 million prepayment fee and legal fees of $0.8 million.

Brigham Minerals did not have any derivative contracts in place as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Prior to December 31, 2019, we had certain oil swap contracts based on the NYMEX futures index. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized a loss on derivative instruments, net of $0.6 million, which is attributable to oil derivative instruments. We realized $0.5 million of gains on our settled derivative instruments during the year ended December 31, 2019.

Our calculation of such effects include realized gains and losses on cash settlements for commodity derivatives, which we do not designate for hedge accounting.\n*** A percentage calculation is not meaningful due to change in signs, zero-value denominator or a change greater than 300.\nRevenues\nTotal revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 increased by 51%, or $34.2 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was attributable to a $38.1 million increase in mineral and royalty revenues during the period, partially offset by a $3.9 million decrease in lease bonus revenue. The increase in mineral and royalty revenues was primarily the result of increased drilling and completion activity on our mineral and royalty interests, which resulted in a 91% increase in production volumes to 7,414 Boe/d and a corresponding increase in revenue of $54.4 million. Realized commodity prices decreased 14% resulting in an additional $16.3 million decrease in mineral and royalty revenues.\nOil revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by 74%, or $35.0 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Oil production volumes increased 95% to 4,151 barrels per day resulting in a $44.7 million increase in oil revenues. The increase in oil production volumes for the period was primarily attributable to increased drilling and completion activity on our properties in Texas, Oklahoma, North Dakota and New Mexico. Realized oil prices decreased 11% to $54.16 per barrel resulting in a decrease in revenue of $9.7 million.\nNatural gas revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by 39%, or $2.7 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Natural gas production volumes increased 88% to 12,896 Mcf/d resulting in a $6.1 million increase in natural gas sales. The increase in natural gas production volumes for the period was primarily attributable to increased drilling and completion activity on our properties in Oklahoma, Colorado, North Dakota, Texas and New Mexico. Realized natural gas prices decreased by 26% to $2.07 per Mcf resulting in a decrease in revenue of $3.4 million.\nNGL revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by 7%, or $0.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. NGL production volumes increased by 83% to 1,114 Boe/d resulting in a $4.8 million increase in NGL sales, while realized NGL prices decreased by 42% to $15.03 per barrel resulting in a decrease in revenue of $4.4 million.\nLease bonus revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased by 52%, or $3.9 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in leasing activity on our interests in Oklahoma, partially offset by an increase in leasing activity in Texas. Other revenues include payments for right-of-way and surface damages and were not a significant portion of the overall amount.\nOperating and other expenses\nGathering, transportation and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by 26%, or $1.0 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, which was largely driven by the increase in our production volumes, partially offset by lower gathering, transportation and marketing rates.\nSeverance and ad valorem taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by 81%, or $2.9 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, which was primarily due to higher severance taxes associated with oil revenue as a result of higher oil production volumes and higher oil prices, as well as higher ad valorem taxes in Texas.\nDD&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by 122%, or $17.0 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, which was primarily due to an increase in depletion expense of $17.1 million. Higher production volumes increased our depletion expense by $12.1 million, and a higher depletion rate increased our depletion expense by $5.0 million.\nGeneral and administrative expense (before share-based compensation expense) for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by 79%, or $5.3 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Increases to G&A expense are a result of: (i) $0.7 million of incremental audit and tax fees, (ii) $0.7 million of additional salaries due to increase in headcount, (iii) $1.1 million of incremental D&O insurance expenses, (iv) $1.1 million of legal and professional fees and (v) $1.7 million of other incremental expenses as a result of becoming a publicly traded company.\nShare-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $10.0 million net of $3.8 million of share-based compensation cost capitalized to unevaluated property. At IPO, we recognized a cumulative effect adjustment of $2.0 million of share-based compensation cost related to the Incentive Units, pertaining to the period from the grant date through the IPO. Additionally, in April of 2019, in connection with the IPO, we adopted the Brigham Minerals, Inc. 2019 LTIP and granted restricted stock awards (\"RSAs\"), restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and performance-based vesting units (\"PSUs\") to our employees and executives. Certain of the RSAs vested immediately and we recognized $3.2 million of share-based compensation cost related to the RSAs. Also, subsequent to the IPO and prior to December 31, 2019, we recognized an additional $8.6 million of share-based compensation cost related to the Incentive Units and the awards granted under the LTIP. No share-based compensation expenses were recognized prior to the IPO because the IPO was not considered probable. See Note 10-Share-Based Compensation\u201d to the consolidated and combined financial statements of Brigham Minerals, Inc. as of December 31, 2019 included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased by $1.8 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 due to lower average outstanding borrowings and lower average interest rates. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our weighted average debt outstanding on our Owl Rock credit facility and revolving credit facility combined was $55.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our weighted average debt outstanding on our Owl Rock credit facility and prior revolving credit facility combined was $86.9 million. Our weighted average interest was 7.29% and 8.10% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In July 2018, proceeds from the Owl Rock credit facility were used to fully repay the outstanding balance of the prior revolving credit facility. In May 2019, a portion of the net proceeds received from the\nIPO were used to fully repay the outstanding borrowings under the Owl Rock credit facility. In December 2019, a portion of the net proceeds received from the December 2019 Offering were used to fully repay the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. See Note 7-Long-Term Debt\u201d and Note 1-Business and Basis of Presentation\u201d to the consolidated and combined financial statements of Brigham Minerals, Inc. as of December 31, 2019 included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion of this transaction.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt. As a result of the full repayment of the outstanding balance of the Owl Rock credit facility of $200.0 million in May 2019, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $6.9 million. The loss on extinguishment of debt consisted of a $4.0 million write-off of capitalized debt issuance costs, a $2.1 million prepayment fee and legal fees of $0.8 million. See Note 7-Long-Term Debt\u201d to the consolidated and combined financial statements of Brigham Minerals, Inc. as of December 31, 2019 included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion of these transactions.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized a loss on derivative instruments, net of $0.6 million, which is attributable to oil derivative instruments. We realized $0.5 million of gains on our settled derivative instruments during the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized a net gain on derivative instruments of $0.4 million, which is attributable to derivative instruments based on the price of oil. We realized $0.8 million of losses on our settled derivative instruments during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nFactors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations to Our Historical Results of Operations\nOur future results of operations may not be comparable to our historical results of operations for the periods presented, primarily for the reasons described below.\nCorporate Reorganization and Transactions\nThe historical consolidated and combined financial statements included in this Annual Report for periods on or before April 23, 2019 are based on the financial statements of our predecessor and Brigham Minerals prior to our corporate reorganization consummated in connection with our IPO. As a result, such historical consolidated and combined financial data may not give you an accurate indication of what our actual results would have been if the corporate reorganization had been completed at the beginning of the periods presented or of what our future results of operations are likely to be.\nIn April 2019, Brigham Minerals completed the IPO of 16,675,000 shares of Class A common stock at a price to the public of $18.00 per share. As a result of the IPO, Brigham Minerals became a holding company whose sole material asset consisted of a 43.3% interest in Brigham LLC, which wholly owns Brigham Resources. Brigham Resources continues to wholly own the Minerals Subsidiaries, which own all of Brigham Resources' operating assets. In connection with the IPO, Brigham Minerals became the sole managing member of Brigham LLC and is responsible for all operational, management and administrative decisions relating to Brigham LLC's business and consolidates the financial results of Brigham LLC and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Brigham Resources.\nOn December 16, 2019, Brigham Minerals completed an offering of 12,650,000 shares of its Class A common stock (the \"December 2019 Offering\"), including 6,000,000 shares issued and sold by Brigham Minerals and an aggregate of 6,650,000 shares sold by certain shareholders of the Company, of which 5,496,813 represents shares issued upon redemption of an equivalent number of their Brigham LLC units, at a price to the public of $18.10 per share.\nOn June 12, 2020, Brigham Minerals completed an offering of 6,600,000 shares of its Class A common stock (the \"June 2020 Secondary Offering\"), all of which were sold by certain shareholders of the Company (the June 2020 Selling Shareholders\u201d), and 4,872,669 of which represented shares issued upon redemption of an equivalent number of the June 2020 Selling Shareholders' Brigham LLC Units (together with a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock in Brigham Minerals), at a price to the public of $13.75 per share. Brigham Minerals did not sell any shares of its common stock in the June 2020 Secondary Offering and did not receive any proceeds pursuant to the June 2020 Secondary Offering.\nOn September 15, 2020, Brigham Minerals completed an offering of 5,021,140 shares of its Class A common stock, including 654,931 shares issued pursuant to the option granted to the underwriter to purchase additional shares to cover over-allotments (the \"September 2020 Secondary Offering\"), all of which were sold by certain shareholders of the Company (the \"September 2020 Selling Shareholders\"), and 3,062,011 of which represented shares issued upon redemption of an equivalent number of the September 2020 Selling Shareholders' Brigham LLC Units (together with a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock in Brigham Minerals), at a price to the public of $8.20 per share. Brigham Minerals did not sell any\nshares of its Class A common stock in the September 2020 Secondary Offering and did not receive any proceeds pursuant to the September 2020 Secondary Offering. In addition, in connection with the September 2020 Secondary Offering, Brigham Minerals repurchased 436,630 shares of its Class A common stock from the September 2020 Selling Shareholders in a privately negotiated transaction at a price equal to the price per share at which the underwriter purchased shares from the September 2020 Selling Shareholders in the September 2020 Secondary Offering (and Brigham LLC redeemed a corresponding number of Brigham LLC Units held by Brigham Minerals). The repurchased shares are presented in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet as Treasury Stock, at cost.\nFollowing the completion of the September 2020 Secondary Offering and as of December 31, 2020, Brigham Minerals owned a 76.8% interest in Brigham LLC and the Original Owners owned 23.2% of the outstanding voting stock of Brigham Minerals. Certain other entities affiliated with Yorktown Partners LLC and Pine Brook Road Advisors, LP, which are a subset of the Company's Original Owners, collectively owned 16.9% of the outstanding voting stock of Brigham Minerals as of December 31, 2020.\nThe corporate reorganization that was completed contemporaneously with the closing of the IPO provided a mechanism by which the Brigham LLC Units to be allocated amongst the Original Owners, including the holders of our management incentive units, was determined. As a result, the satisfaction of all conditions relating to the vesting of certain management incentive units held in Brigham Equity Holdings, LLC ( Brigham Equity Holdings\u201d) by our management and employees became probable. Accordingly, at IPO, we recognized a cumulative effect adjustment to share-based compensation cost of approximately $2.0 million pertaining to the period from the grant date through the IPO date, related to the estimated fair value of the Incentive Units (as defined in Note 10-Share-based Compensation-LLC Incentive Units\u201d to the consolidated and combined financial statements of Brigham Minerals included elsewhere in this Annual Report) at grant, all of which was non-cash.\nIncome Taxes\nBrigham Minerals is subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes as a corporation. Our predecessor was treated as a flow-through entity, and is currently treated as a disregarded entity, for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, is generally not subject to U.S. federal income tax at the entity level. Rather, the tax liability with respect to its taxable income is passed through to its members, including Brigham Minerals. Accordingly, the financial data of our predecessor contains no provision for U.S. federal income taxes or income taxes in any state or locality (other than franchise tax in the State of Texas).\nCapital Requirements and Sources of Liquidity\nPrior to our IPO, our primary sources of liquidity were capital contributions from our Original Owners, borrowings under our debt arrangements and cash flows from operations. Subsequent to our IPO, our current primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and proceeds from any primary issuances of equity securities. Future sources of liquidity may also include other credit facilities we may enter into in the future and additional issuances of debt or equity securities. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the decline in commodities prices, coupled with many of our operators announcing significant reductions in projected capital expenditures in 2020 and beyond, our revenues and cash flows from operations have been and may continue to be negatively impacted and we may not have access to capital markets on terms favorable to us or at all.\nOur primary uses of capital are for the payment of dividends to our stockholders and for investing in our business, specifically the acquisition of additional mineral and royalty interests. In connection with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the announced reductions in projected capital expenditures by our operators, our cash flows from operations have been and may continue to be negatively impacted, and as a result, the dividend amount we are able to pay our stockholders has been and may also continue to be negatively impacted.\nAs a mineral and royalty interest owner, we incur the initial cost to acquire our interests, but thereafter do not incur any development capital expenditures or lease operating expenses, which are entirely borne by the operator. As a result, the vast majority of our capital expenditures are related to our acquisition of additional mineral and royalty interests. The amount and allocation of future acquisition-related capital expenditures will depend upon a number of factors, including the number and size of acquisition opportunities, our cash flows from operations, investing and financing activities and our ability to assimilate acquisitions. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we deployed approximately $72.7 million for acquisition-related capital expenditures, inclusive of a $6.1 million capitalized share-based compensation cost. We periodically assess changes in current and projected free cash flows, acquisition and divestiture activities, debt requirements and other factors to determine the effects\non our liquidity. Based upon our current oil, natural gas and NGL price expectations for the year ended December 31, 2021, we believe that our cash flow from operations and additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility will provide us with sufficient liquidity to execute our current strategy. However, our ability to generate cash is subject to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including commodity prices, weather and general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors. If we require additional capital for acquisitions or other reasons, we may seek such capital through additional borrowings, joint venture partnerships, asset sales, offerings of equity and debt securities or other means. If we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms, we may not be able to complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our liquidity was as follows:\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving credit facility availability </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>115.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Liquidity </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>124.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWorking Capital\nOur working capital, which we define as current assets minus current liabilities, totaled $22.6 million as of December 31, 2020, as compared to $71.6 million at December 31, 2019. Our collection of receivables has historically been timely, and losses associated with uncollectible receivables have historically not been significant.\nWhen new wells are turned to sales, our collection of receivables has lagged approximately six months from initial production as operators complete the division order process, at which point we are paid in arrears and then kept current. Our cash and cash equivalents balance totaled $9.1 million and $51.1 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to acquisitions made and payment of dividends to our stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2020 . See \"Note 4-Acquisitions and Divestitures\" to the consolidated and combined financial statements of Brigham Minerals included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion. We expect that our cash flows from operations and additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs. We expect that the pace of our operators' drilling and completion of our undeveloped locations, production volumes, commodity prices and differentials to WTI and Henry Hub prices for our oil, natural gas and NGL production will be the largest variables affecting our working capital.\nDividends\nThe following table sets forth information with respect to cash dividends and distributions declared by our board of directors during 2020:\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Declaration Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Record Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Payment Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Dividend Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> Dividends paid\n(in thousands) (1) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>February 27, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>March 12, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>March 19, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.38 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,969 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>May 11, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>May 27, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>June 3, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>0.37 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,803 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>August 6, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>August 27, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>September 3, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>0.14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,567 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>November 4, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>November 30, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 7, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>0.24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,877 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total: </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,216 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Dividends paid to holders of Class A common stock.\nThe decision to pay any future dividends is solely within the discretion of, and subject to approval by, our board of directors. Our board of directors' determination with respect to any such dividends, including the record date, the payment date and the actual amount of the dividend, will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors that the board deems relevant at the time of such determination. See \"Item 5 - Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities-Dividend Policy\" for further discussion of our dividend policy.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75,260 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69,025 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,444 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(65,425) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(216,832) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(195,268) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in)/provided by financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(51,824) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>166,481 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>189,397 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAnalysis of Cash Flow Changes Between the Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nNet cash provided by operating activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities is primarily affected by production volumes, the prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs, lease bonus revenue and changes in working capital. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 is primarily due to improved collections of receivables and reduced payments for interest and income taxes, partly offset by increased payments for operating expenses.\nThe increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily due to: (i) a 91% increase in production volumes and the 14% decrease in realized prices during the year ended December 31, 2019 discussed above; (ii) increases in operating expenses; and (iii) lower lease bonus revenues.\nNet cash used in investing activities\nNet cash used in investing activities is primarily composed of acquisitions of mineral and royalty interests, net of dispositions. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our net cash used in investing activities was primarily a result of acquisitions of mineral and royalty interests totaling $66.5 million and other fixed assets totaling $0.5 million, offset by sales of mineral and royalty interests totaling $1.6 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our net cash used in investing activities was primarily a result of acquisitions of mineral and royalty interests totaling $219.5 million and additions to other fixed assets of $0.4 million, offset by sales of mineral and royalty interests totaling $3.1 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, our net cash used in investing activities was primarily a result of acquisitions of mineral and royalty interests totaling $195.6 million and additions to other fixed assets of $0.7 million. Our cash flows from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 also reflects $0.9 million of proceeds from the sale of equity securities.\nNet cash (used in)/provided by financing activities\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily a result of dividends paid to holders of our Class A common stock of $42.2 million, distributions to holders of temporary equity of $24.7 million, the repurchase of shares of our Class A common stock from the September 2020 Selling Shareholders for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $3.5 million, and payment related to employee tax withholding for settlement of share-based compensation awards of $1.2 million. This was partially offset by borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $20.0 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 included the combined net proceeds generated from the IPO and December 2019 Offering of $379.8 million offset by the combined full repayment of the outstanding balances of the Owl Rock credit facility and revolving credit facility of $175.0 million (net of additional borrowings of $105.0 million incurred during the year), dividends paid to holders of our Class A common stock of $14.7 million, distributions to holders of temporary equity of $20.1 million, payment of debt extinguishment fees of $2.1 million and payment of loan closing costs of $1.3 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 included $46.0 million in net capital contributions from the Original Owners and $213.4 million in additional borrowings under our prior revolving credit facility and the Owl Rock credit facility combined, net of $4.6 million in associated loan closing costs. This was partially offset by payment of $70.0 million to pay off and terminate the prior revolving credit facility on July 28, 2018 using funds from the new term loan facility.\nOwl Rock Credit Facility\nOn July 27, 2018, we entered into a credit agreement with Owl Rock Capital Corporation, as administrative agent and collateral agent (our Owl Rock credit facility\u201d). Our Owl Rock credit facility was subject to customary fees, guarantees of subsidiaries, restrictions and covenants, including certain restricted payments, and was collateralized by certain of our royalty and mineral properties.\nOur Owl Rock credit facility provided for a $125.0 million initial term loan and a $75.0 million delayed draw term loan ( DDTL\u201d). Also, a $10.0 million revolving credit facility was available for general corporate purposes, which was undrawn as of May 7, 2019. Our Owl Rock credit facility bore interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, (a) the base rate plus 4.50%, or (b) the adjusted LIBOR rate for such interest period (subject to a 1.00% floor) plus 5.50%. We used a portion of the proceeds from the IPO to repay the outstanding borrowings under the term loan portion and DDTL portion of our Owl Rock credit facility and terminated the Owl Rock credit facility on May 7, 2019. See Note 7-Long-Term Debt\u201d to the consolidated and combined financial statements of Brigham Minerals included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion.\nPrior Revolving Credit Facility\nPrior to entering into our Owl Rock credit facility (which was terminated in May 2019), we maintained a revolving credit facility (our prior revolving credit facility\u201d) with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain lenders party thereto with commitments of $150.0 million (subject to a borrowing base). We repaid the $70.0 million outstanding balance under our prior revolving credit facility with proceeds from our Owl Rock credit facility and terminated the prior revolving credit facility. The borrowing base at the time of termination was $70.0 million.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn May 16, 2019 (the closing date\u201d), Brigham Resources entered into a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent for the various lenders from time to time party thereto, providing for a revolving credit facility (our revolving credit facility\u201d). Our revolving credit facility is guaranteed by Brigham Resources' domestic subsidiaries and is collateralized by a lien on substantial portion of Brigham Resources and its domestic subsidiaries' assets, including substantial portion of their respective royalty and mineral properties.\nAvailability under our revolving credit facility is governed by a borrowing base, which is subject to redetermination in May and November of each year. In addition, lenders holding two-thirds of the aggregate commitments may request one additional redetermination each year. Brigham Resources can also request one additional redetermination each year, and such other redeterminations as appropriate when significant acquisition opportunities arise. The borrowing base is subject to further adjustments for asset dispositions, material title deficiencies, certain terminations of hedge agreements and issuances of permitted additional indebtedness. Increases to the borrowing base require unanimous approval of the lenders, while decreases only require approval of lenders holding two-thirds of the aggregate commitments at such time. As of December 31, 2020, the borrowing base on our revolving credit facility was $135.0 million, with outstanding borrowings of $20.0 million, resulting in $115.0 million availability for future borrowings.\nOur revolving credit facility bears interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, the adjusted base rate or the adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on utilization of our revolving credit facility and ranges from (a) in the case of adjusted base rate loans, 0.750% to 1.750% and (b) in the case of adjusted LIBOR rate loans, 1.750% to 2.750%. Brigham Resources may elect an interest period of one, two, three, six, or if available to all lenders, twelve months. Interest is payable in arrears at the end of each interest period, but no less frequently than quarterly. A commitment fee is payable quarterly in arrears on the daily undrawn available commitments under our revolving credit facility in an amount ranging from 0.375% to 0.500% based on utilization of our revolving credit facility. Our revolving credit facility is subject to other customary fee, interest and expense reimbursement provisions.\nOur revolving credit facility matures on May 16, 2024. Loans drawn under our revolving credit facility may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty (other than customary LIBOR breakage) and must be prepaid in the event that exposure exceeds the lesser of the borrowing base and the elected availability at such time. The principal amount of loans that are prepaid are required to be accompanied by accrued and unpaid interest and fees on such amounts. Loans that are prepaid may be reborrowed. In addition, Brigham Resources may permanently reduce or terminate in full the commitments under our revolving credit facility prior to maturity. Any excess exposure resulting from such permanent reduction or termination must be prepaid. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our revolving credit facility, the administrative agent acting at the direction of the lenders holding a majority of the aggregate commitments at such time may accelerate outstanding loans and terminate all\ncommitments under our revolving credit facility, provided that such acceleration and termination occurs automatically upon the occurrence of a bankruptcy or insolvency event of default.\nContractual Obligations\nA summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 is provided in the following table:\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>By Year </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>2025 </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations (1) (2) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office lease </td> <td> </td> <td>1,272 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,347 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,383 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,419 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,251 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,982 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,272 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,347 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,383 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,419 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,251 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,982 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) As of December 31, 2020, the borrowing base on our revolving credit facility was $135.0 million, with outstanding borrowings of $20.0 million, resulting in $115.0 million availability for future borrowings.\n(2) Does not include future unutilized fees, amortization of deferred financing costs, interest expense or other fees related to our revolving credit facility because we cannot determine with accuracy the timing of future loan advances, repayments or future interest rates to be charged.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated and combined financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated and combined financial statements requires it to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Changes in facts and circumstances or additional information may result in revised estimates, and actual results may differ from these estimates.\nA complete list of our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our audited consolidated and combined financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated and combined financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated and combined financial statements and accompanying notes. Although management believes these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are recorded prospectively.\nOur consolidated and combined financial statements are based on a number of significant estimates including quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves that are the basis for the calculations of DD&A and impairment of oil and natural gas properties. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas and there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, reserve estimates may differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. Our reserve estimates are audited by CG&A, an independent petroleum engineering firm. Other items subject to significant estimates and assumptions include the carrying amount of oil and natural gas properties, valuation of derivative instruments and revenue accruals.\nReceivables\nReceivables consist of mineral and royalty income due from operators for oil and gas sales to purchasers. Those purchasers remit payment for production to the operator of the properties and the operator, in turn, remits payment to us. Receivables from third parties for which we did not receive actual information, either due to timing delays or due to the unavailability of data at the time when revenues are recognized, are estimated. Volume estimates for wells with available historical actual data are based upon (i) the historical actual data for the months the data is available, or (ii) engineering estimates for the months the historical actual data is not available. We do not recognize revenues for wells with no historical actual data because we cannot conclude that it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in future periods. Pricing estimates are based upon actual prices realized in an area by adjusting the market price for the average basis differential from market on a basin-by-basin basis.\nWe routinely review outstanding balances, assess the financial strength of our operators and record a reserve for amounts not expected to be fully recovered. We recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of $0.3 million, $0.6 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOil and Gas Properties\nWe use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties. Under this method, all acquisition costs incurred for the purpose of acquiring mineral and royalty interests and certain related employee costs are capitalized into a full cost pool. Costs associated with general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred.\nCapitalized costs are amortized using the units-of-production method. Under this method, the provision for depletion is calculated by multiplying total production for the period by a depletion rate. The depletion rate is determined by dividing the total unamortized cost base by the net equivalent proved reserves at the beginning of the period.\nCosts associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the amortizable cost base until a determination has been made as to the existence of proved reserves. Unevaluated properties are reviewed periodically to determine whether the costs incurred should be reclassified to the full cost pool and subjected to amortization. The costs associated with unevaluated properties primarily consist of acquisition and leasehold costs and capitalized interest. Unevaluated properties are assessed for impairment on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant. The assessment includes consideration of the following factors, among others: expectation of future drilling activity; past drilling results and activity; geological and geophysical evaluations; the assignment of proved reserves; and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned. During any period in which these factors indicate an impairment, the cumulative acquisition costs incurred to date for such property are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to amortization. There was no impairment recorded for unevaluated properties for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nSales and abandonments of oil and natural gas properties being amortized are accounted for as adjustments to the full cost pool, with no gain or loss recognized unless the adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves. A significant alteration would not ordinarily be expected to occur upon the sale of reserves involving less than 25% of the reserve quantities of a cost center.\nNatural gas volumes are converted to Boe at the rate of six thousand Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of oil. This convention is not an equivalent price basis and there may be a large difference in value between an equivalent volume of oil versus an equivalent volume of natural gas.\nUnder the full cost method of accounting, total capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated depletion and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount equal to the present value of future net revenues from proved reserves, discounted at 10% per annum (\"PV-10\"), plus the cost of unevaluated properties, less related income tax effects (full cost ceiling limitation). A write-down of the carrying value of the full cost pool (\"impairment charge\") is a noncash charge that reduces earnings and impacts equity in the period of occurrence and typically results in lower depletion expense in future periods. A ceiling limitation is calculated at each reporting period. The ceiling limitation calculation is prepared using the unweighted arithmetic average of oil price (\"SEC oil price\") and natural gas price (\"SEC gas price\") as of the first day of each month for the trailing 12-month period ended, as required under the guidelines established by the SEC. As of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the SEC oil prices were $39.57, $55.65, and $65.66, respectively, per barrel for oil, further adjusted by area for energy content, transportation fees and regional price differentials and the SEC gas prices were $2.00, $2.60, and $3.12, respectively, per MMBtu for natural gas, further adjusted by area for energy content, transportation fees and regional price differentials. As a result of the decline in the SEC oil prices and SEC gas prices during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, and taking into consideration certain reclassification of proved undeveloped reserves to probable and possible reserves during the three months ended December 31, 2020, as a result of a slowdown in operator activity, the net book value of oil and natural gas properties exceeded the ceiling limitation as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020, resulting in an impairment charge of $79.6 million to oil and gas properties, net during the year ended December 31, 2020. There were no impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nFuture declines in the unweighted arithmetic average SEC oil prices used in the full cost ceiling test may result in additional impairment charges in the future and such impairments could be material. In addition to the impact of lower prices, any future changes to assumptions of drilling and completion activity, development timing, acquisitions or divestitures of oil and gas properties, proved undeveloped locations, and production and other estimates may require revisions to estimates of total proved reserves which would impact the amount of any impairment charge.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, Brigham Minerals reduced its proved undeveloped reserves by 8,209 MBoe primarily due to a reclassification of 7,036 MBoe from proved undeveloped reserves to probable and possible reserves, as a result of decreased rig activity, a 29% reduction in SEC oil prices over the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, and conversion from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves. The reduction in rig activity led to changes in the development timing and a reduction of the number of proved undeveloped locations that Brigham Minerals expects will be developed within five years after the date of booking.\nWe engage CG&A, our independent petroleum engineering firm, to audit our total estimated proved, probable and possible reserves. We expect proved, probable and possible reserve estimates will change as additional information becomes available and as commodity prices and costs change. We evaluate and estimate our proved, probable and possible reserves internally each quarter and CG&A audits our proved, probable and possible reserves annually. Reserve estimates are inherently imprecise. Accordingly, the estimates are expected to change as more current information becomes available. The estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves are based upon the use of technical and economic data including, but not limited to, well logs, geologic maps, seismic data, well test data, production data, historical price and cost information, historical and future operator development plans, and property ownership interests. Standard engineering and geoscience methods, such as reservoir modeling, performance analysis, volumetric analysis and analogy, which are considered to be appropriate and necessary to establish reserve quantities and reserve categorization that conform to SEC definitions and rules and regulations, are also used. As in all aspects of oil and natural gas evaluation, there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of engineering and geoscience data; therefore, these estimates necessarily represent only informed professional judgment.\nIt is possible that, because of changes in market conditions or the inherent imprecision of reserve estimates, the estimates of future cash inflows, future gross revenue, the amount of oil and natural gas reserves, the remaining estimated lives of oil and natural gas properties or any combination of the above may be increased or reduced. Increases in recoverable economic volumes generally reduce per unit depletion rates while decreases in recoverable economic volumes generally increase per unit depletion rates.\nIt should not be assumed that the standardized measure included in this report as of December 31, 2020 is the current market value of our estimated proved reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we based the 2020 standardized measure on the SEC oil price and SEC gas price as of December 31, 2020, and prevailing costs on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs utilized in the estimate. See Item 1 - Business-Oil, Natural Gas, and NGLs Data-Proved, Probable and Possible Reserves\u201d and Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d for additional information regarding estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nIn 2019, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (\"ASC 606\") using the modified retrospective approach, which only applied to contracts that were in effect as of the date of adoption. The adoption did not require an adjustment to opening retained earnings for the cumulative effect adjustment and did not impact our previously reported results of operations, nor our ongoing consolidated and combined balance sheets, statements of cash flow or statements of changes in shareholders' and members' equity. Overall, there were no material changes in the timing of the satisfaction of our performance obligations or the allocation of the transaction price to our performance obligations in applying the guidance in ASC 606 as compared to legacy U.S. GAAP.\nOil and natural gas sales\nOil, natural gas and NGLs sales revenues are generally recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer, the performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with customers are satisfied and collectability is reasonably assured. As a non-operator, we have limited visibility into the timing of when new wells start producing and production statements may not be received for 30 to 90 days or more after the date production is delivered. As a result, we are required to estimate the amount of production delivered to the purchaser and the price that we will receive for the sale of the product. The expected sales volumes and prices for these properties are estimated and recorded within the Accounts receivable line item in the accompanying consolidated and combined balance sheets. The difference between our estimates and the actual amounts received for oil and natural gas sales is recorded in the month that payment is received from the third party.\nLease bonus and other income\nWe earn revenue from lease bonuses, delay rentals, and right-of-way payments. We generate lease bonus revenue by leasing our mineral interests to exploration and production companies. A lease agreement represents our contract with a customer and generally transfers the rights to any oil or natural gas discovered, grants us a right to a specified royalty interest, and requires that drilling and completion operations commence within a specified time period. We recognize lease bonus revenues when the lease agreement has been executed, payment has been received, and we have no further obligation to refund the payment. At the time we execute the lease agreement, we expect to receive the lease bonus payment within a reasonable\ntime, though in no case more than one year, such that we have not adjusted the expected amount of consideration for the effects of any significant financing component per the practical expedient in ASC 606.\nShare-Based Compensation\nBrigham Minerals accounts for its share-based compensation, including grants of the Incentive Units, restricted stock awards, time-based restricted stock units and performance-based stock units, in the condensed consolidated and combined statements of operations based on their estimated fair values at grant date. Brigham Minerals uses a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the fair value of performance-based stock units. Brigham Minerals recognizes expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the respective grant, which is generally the requisite service period. Brigham Minerals capitalizes a portion of the share-based compensation cost to oil and gas properties on the consolidated and combined balance sheets. Share-based compensation expense is included in general and administrative expenses in Brigham Minerals' consolidated and combined statements of operations included within this Annual Report. There was approximately $17.0 million of unamortized compensation expense relating to outstanding awards at December 31, 2020, a portion of which will be capitalized. The unrecognized compensation expense will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining vesting periods of the awards. Brigham Minerals accounts for forfeitures as they occur.\nIncome Taxes\nBrigham Minerals accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated by applying existing tax laws and the rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe periodically assess whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets, including net operating losses. In making this determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions. We consider, among other things, our deferred tax liabilities, the overall business environment, our historical earnings and losses, current industry trends and our outlook for future years.\nTemporary Equity\nBrigham Minerals accounts for the Original Owners' 23.2% interest in Brigham LLC (as of December 31, 2020) as temporary equity as a result of certain redemption rights held by the Original Owners as discussed in Note 9-Temporary Equity\u201d to the consolidated and combined financial statements of Brigham Minerals included elsewhere in this Annual Report. As such, Brigham Minerals adjusts temporary equity to its maximum redemption amount at the balance sheet date, if higher than the carrying amount. The redemption amount is based on the 10-day volume-weighted average closing price ( VWAP\u201d) of Class A shares at the end of the reporting period. Changes in the redemption value are recognized immediately as they occur, as if the end of the reporting period was also the redemption date for the instrument, with an offsetting entry to additional paid-in capital. Temporary equity is reclassified to permanent equity (i) upon Conversion of Class B common stock (and an equivalent number of Brigham LLC Units) to Class A common stock, or (ii) when holders of Class B common stock no longer control a majority of the votes of the board of directors through direct representation on the board of directors, and no longer control the determination of whether to make a cash payment upon a Brigham Unit Holder's exercise of its Redemption Right.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2-Significant Accounting Policies-Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\u201d in our consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.\nWe are an emerging growth company,\u201d under the JOBS Act, which allows us to take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act.\nInternal Controls and Procedures\nUpon becoming a public company, we were required to comply with the SEC's rules implementing Section 302 and Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires our management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports, and, for the year ended December 31, 2020, provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, we will be required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 beginning with our first annual report subsequent to our ceasing to be an emerging growth company\u201d within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2020, we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.", "item_7_truncated": "\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75,260 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69,025 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,444 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(65,425) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(216,832) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(195,268) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in)/provided by financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(51,824) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>166,481 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>189,397 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nyear ended December 31, 2019.

See Note 7-Long-Term Debt\u201d to the consolidated and combined financial statements of Brigham Minerals included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion of these transactions.\nIn order to track and assess the performance of our assets, we monitor and analyze the number of rigs currently drilling our properties. We also constantly monitor the number of permits, spuds, completions and wells on production that are applicable to our mineral and royalty interests in an effort to evaluate near-term production growth from the various basins and resource plays that comprise our asset base.\nOn May 16, 2019 (the closing date\u201d), Brigham Resources entered into a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent for the various lenders from time to time party thereto, providing for a revolving credit facility (our revolving credit facility\u201d). Our revolving credit facility is guaranteed by Brigham Resources' domestic subsidiaries and is collateralized by a lien on substantial portion of Brigham Resources and its domestic subsidiaries' assets, including substantial portion of their respective royalty and mineral properties.\nCommodity Prices\nAs of December 31, 2020, our liquidity was as follows:\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>By Year </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>2025 </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations (1) (2) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office lease </td> <td> </td> <td>1,272 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,347 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,383 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,419 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,251 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,982 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,272 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,347 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,383 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,419 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,251 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,982 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur revolving credit facility bears interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, the adjusted base rate or the adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on utilization of our revolving credit facility and ranges from (a) in the case of adjusted base rate loans, 0.750% to 1.750% and (b) in the case of adjusted LIBOR rate loans, 1.750% to 2.750%. Brigham Resources may elect an interest period of one, two, three, six, or if available to all lenders, twelve months. Interest is payable in arrears at the end of each interest period, but no less frequently than quarterly. A commitment fee is payable quarterly in arrears on the daily undrawn available commitments under our revolving credit facility in an amount ranging from 0.375% to 0.500% based on utilization of our revolving credit facility.

revenues we receive for our royalty interests and could affect our ability to access the capital markets on terms favorable to us. Additionally, in response to the declining commodity prices, many operators on our properties substantially reduced their capital expenditures during 2020 and have announced similarly reduced capital expenditures for 2021 and beyond, which has adversely affected the development of our properties and will continue to affect the development of our properties into 2021 and beyond. While these lower commodity prices initially resulted in some of the Company's operators shutting in or curtailing production from wells on its properties during the second quarter of 2020, the Company saw a majority of its operators resume production for previously curtailed and shut in wells in connection with the improvement of commodity prices in the third and fourth quarters of 2020.

Also, a $10.0 million revolving credit facility was available for general corporate purposes, which was undrawn as of May 7, 2019. Our Owl Rock credit facility bore interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, (a) the base rate plus 4.50%, or (b) the adjusted LIBOR rate for such interest period (subject to a 1.00% floor) plus 5.50%. We used a portion of the proceeds from the IPO to repay the outstanding borrowings under the term loan portion and DDTL portion of our Owl Rock credit facility and terminated the Owl Rock credit facility on May 7, 2019. See Note 7-Long-Term Debt\u201d to the consolidated and combined financial statements of Brigham Minerals included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion.\non our liquidity. Based upon our current oil, natural gas and NGL price expectations for the year ended December 31, 2021, we believe that our cash flow from operations and additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility will provide us with sufficient liquidity to execute our current strategy. However, our ability to generate cash is subject to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including commodity prices, weather and general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors. If we require additional capital for acquisitions or other reasons, we may seek such capital through additional borrowings, joint venture partnerships, asset sales, offerings of equity and debt securities or other means. If we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms, we may not be able to complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us.\nSeverance and ad valorem taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by 13%, or $0.8 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the 12% decrease in mineral and royalty revenues.\nOil and Gas Properties\nThe increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily due to: (i) a 91% increase in production volumes and the 14% decrease in realized prices during the year ended December 31, 2019 discussed above; (ii) increases in operating expenses; and (iii) lower lease bonus revenues.\nCapitalized costs are amortized using the units-of-production method. Under this method, the provision for depletion is calculated by multiplying total production for the period by a depletion rate. The depletion rate is determined by dividing the total unamortized cost base by the net equivalent proved reserves at the beginning of the period.\nNumber of Rigs on Location, Permits, Spuds, Completions and Wells Turned-In-Line\nNGL revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by 7%, or $0.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. NGL production volumes increased by 83% to 1,114 Boe/d resulting in a $4.8 million increase in NGL sales, while realized NGL prices decreased by 42% to $15.03 per barrel resulting in a decrease in revenue of $4.4 million.\nBrigham Minerals accounts for its share-based compensation, including grants of the Incentive Units, restricted stock awards, time-based restricted stock units and performance-based stock units, in the condensed consolidated and combined statements of operations based on their estimated fair values at grant date. Brigham Minerals uses a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the fair value of performance-based stock units. Brigham Minerals recognizes expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the respective grant, which is generally the requisite service period. Brigham Minerals capitalizes a portion of the share-based compensation cost to oil and gas properties on the consolidated and combined balance sheets. Share-based compensation expense is included in general and administrative expenses in Brigham Minerals' consolidated and combined statements of operations included within this Annual Report. There was approximately $17.0 million of unamortized compensation expense relating to outstanding awards at December 31, 2020, a portion of which will be capitalized. The unrecognized compensation expense will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining vesting periods of the awards. Brigham Minerals accounts for forfeitures as they occur.\nBrigham Minerals is subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes as a corporation. Our predecessor was treated as a flow-through entity, and is currently treated as a disregarded entity, for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, is generally not subject to U.S. federal income tax at the entity level. Rather, the tax liability with respect to its taxable income is passed through to its members, including Brigham Minerals. Accordingly, the financial data of our predecessor contains no provision for U.S. federal income taxes or income taxes in any state or locality (other than franchise tax in the State of Texas).\nWe use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties. Under this method, all acquisition costs incurred for the purpose of acquiring mineral and royalty interests and certain related employee costs are capitalized into a full cost pool. Costs associated with general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred.\nIt should not be assumed that the standardized measure included in this report as of December 31, 2020 is the current market value of our estimated proved reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we based the 2020 standardized measure on the SEC oil price and SEC gas price as of December 31, 2020, and prevailing costs on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs utilized in the estimate. See Item 1 - Business-Oil, Natural Gas, and NGLs Data-Proved, Probable and Possible Reserves\u201d and Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d for additional information regarding estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves.\nPrior Revolving Credit Facility\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated and combined financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated and combined financial statements requires it to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Changes in facts and circumstances or additional information may result in revised estimates, and actual results may differ from these estimates.\n*** A percentage calculation is not meaningful due to change in signs, zero-value denominator or a change greater than 300.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Item 6 - Selected Financial Data\u201d and the accompanying consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nHistorically, oil, natural gas and NGL prices have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. During the past five years, the posted price for WTI has ranged from a historic, record low price of negative ($36.98) per barrel in April 2020 to a high of $77.41 per barrel in June 2018. The Henry Hub spot market price for natural gas has ranged from a low of $1.33 per MMBtu in September 2020 to a high of $6.24 per MMBtu in January 2018. As of December 31, 2020, the posted price for oil was $48.35 per barrel and the Henry Hub spot market price of natural gas was $2.36 per MMBtu. Lower prices may not only decrease our revenues, but also potentially the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs that our operators can produce economically.\n\nWe use a variety of operational and financial measures to assess our performance. Among the measures considered by management are the following:\nShare-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by 25%, or $2.5 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in share-based compensation expense was due to a cumulative effect adjustment of $5.2 million pertaining to the period from the grant date to the IPO, which consists of a $2.0 million cumulative effect adjustment related to the estimated fair value of the Incentive Units and a $3.2 million cumulative effect adjustment related to the estimated fair value of the RSAs, partially offset by share-based compensation expense related to awards granted during the year ended December 31, 2020. Brigham Minerals capitalizes a portion of the share-based compensation cost incurred after the IPO. See table below and \"Note 10-Share-Based Compensation\" to the consolidated and combined financial statements of Brigham Minerals included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased by $1.8 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 due to lower average outstanding borrowings and lower average interest rates. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our weighted average debt outstanding on our Owl Rock credit facility and revolving credit facility combined was $55.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our weighted average debt outstanding on our Owl Rock credit facility and prior revolving credit facility combined was $86.9 million. Our weighted average interest was 7.29% and 8.10% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In July 2018, proceeds from the Owl Rock credit facility were used to fully repay the outstanding balance of the prior revolving credit facility. In May 2019, a portion of the net proceeds received from the\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nNGLs. NGL pricing is generally tied to the price of oil, but varies based on differences in liquid components and location.\nIncome Taxes\nOperating Activity Update\nGathering, transportation and marketing expenses include the costs to process and transport our production to applicable sales points. Generally, the terms of the lease governing the development of our properties permits the operator to pass through these expenses to us by deducting a pro rata portion of such expenses from our production revenues.\nWe finance a portion of our working capital requirements and acquisitions with borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As a result, we incur interest expense that is affected by both fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions. We reflect interest paid to the lenders under our debt arrangements (currently, our revolving credit facility) in interest expense. In connection with the closing of our IPO, we fully repaid the outstanding borrowings under our Owl Rock credit facility. Please see Note 7-Long-Term Debt\u201d to the consolidated and combined financial statements of Brigham Minerals included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n\u2022On February 19, 2021, the Board of Directors of Brigham Minerals declared a dividend of $0.26 per share of Class A common stock payable on March 26, 2021 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 19, 2021.This brings the total capital returned to shareholders related to financial results from fiscal year 2020 to $1.01 per share.\nLocation differentials generally result from transportation costs based on the produced oil's proximity to consuming and refining markets and major trading points.\nOperating and other expenses\nWhen new wells are turned to sales, our collection of receivables has lagged approximately six months from initial production as operators complete the division order process, at which point we are paid in arrears and then kept current. Our cash and cash equivalents balance totaled $9.1 million and $51.1 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to acquisitions made and payment of dividends to our stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2020. See \"Note 4-Acquisitions and Divestitures\" to the consolidated and combined financial statements of Brigham Minerals included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion. We expect that our cash flows from operations and additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs. We expect that the pace of our operators' drilling and completion of our undeveloped locations, production volumes, commodity prices and differentials to WTI and Henry Hub prices for our oil, natural gas and NGL production will be the largest variables affecting our working capital.\nDD&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by 56%, or $17.3 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, which was primarily due to an increase in depletion expense of $17.0 million. Higher production volumes increased our depletion expense by $8.6 million, and a higher depletion rate increased our depletion expense by $8.4 million. The depletion rate was $13.63 per Boe and $11.22 per Boe for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in the depletion rate was a result of recent acquisition efforts focused on largely de-risked acreage with an increased likelihood of near-term production and development, as well as reclassification of proved undeveloped reserves to probable and possible reserves due to changes in assumptions of the development timing as a result of reduced activity by our operators. We adjust our depletion rates quarterly based upon the quarter-end internally generated reserve reports.\nSeverance and ad valorem taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by 81%, or $2.9 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, which was primarily due to higher severance taxes associated with oil revenue as a result of higher oil production volumes and higher oil prices, as well as higher ad valorem taxes in Texas.\nTemporary Equity\ncommitments under our revolving credit facility, provided that such acceleration and termination occurs automatically upon the occurrence of a bankruptcy or insolvency event of default.\nFactors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations to Our Historical Results of Operations\ntime, though in no case more than one year, such that we have not adjusted the expected amount of consideration for the effects of any significant financing component per the practical expedient in ASC 606.\nGathering, transportation, and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by 40%, or $2.0 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, which was largely driven by the 28% increase in our production volumes as well as an increase in gathering, transportation and marketing rates.\nUpon becoming a public company, we were required to comply with the SEC's rules implementing Section 302 and Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires our management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports, and, for the year ended December 31, 2020, provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, we will be required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 beginning with our first annual report subsequent to our ceasing to be an emerging growth company\u201d within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act.\nThe following table sets forth information with respect to cash dividends and distributions declared by our board of directors during 2020:\nNatural Gas. The NYMEX price quoted at Henry Hub is a widely used benchmark for the pricing of natural gas in the United States. The actual volumetric prices realized from the sale of natural gas differ from the quoted NYMEX price as a result of quality and location differentials.\nInterest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by 84%, or $4.7 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 due to lower average outstanding borrowings and lower average interest rates. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our weighted average debt outstanding on our revolving credit facility was $2.8 million compared to our weighted average debt outstanding on our Owl Rock credit facility and revolving credit facility combined of $55.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our weighted average interest was 1.91% and 7.29% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In May 2019, a portion of the net proceeds received from the IPO were used to fully repay the outstanding borrowings under the Owl Rock credit facility. In December 2019, a portion of the net proceeds received from the December 2019 Offering were used to fully repay the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. See table below and Note 7-Long-Term Debt\u201d and Note 1-Business and Basis of Presentation\u201d to the consolidated and combined financial statements of Brigham Minerals included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion of this transaction.\nA summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 is provided in the following table:\nNet cash used in investing activities\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. The forward-looking statements are dependent upon events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, market prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs, production volumes, estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves, mineral acquisition capital, economic and competitive conditions, regulatory changes and other uncertainties, as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d all of which are difficult to predict. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed may not occur. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements except as otherwise required by applicable law.\nThe chemical composition of crude oil plays an important role in its refining and subsequent sale as petroleum products. As a result, variations in chemical composition relative to the benchmark crude oil, usually WTI, will result in price adjustments, which are often referred to as quality differentials. The characteristics that most significantly affect quality differentials include the density of the oil, as characterized by its API gravity, and the presence and concentration of impurities, such as sulfur.\n\nOn December 16, 2019, Brigham Minerals completed an offering of 12,650,000 shares of its Class A common stock (the \"December 2019 Offering\"), including 6,000,000 shares issued and sold by Brigham Minerals and an aggregate of 6,650,000 shares sold by certain shareholders of the Company, of which 5,496,813 represents shares issued upon redemption of an equivalent number of their Brigham LLC units, at a price to the public of $18.10 per share.\nDD&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by 122%, or $17.0 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, which was primarily due to an increase in depletion expense of $17.1 million. Higher production volumes increased our depletion expense by $12.1 million, and a higher depletion rate increased our depletion expense by $5.0 million.\nInterest Expense\n(2) Does not include future unutilized fees, amortization of deferred financing costs, interest expense or other fees related to our revolving credit facility because we cannot determine with accuracy the timing of future loan advances, repayments or future interest rates to be charged.\n\u2022Our production volumes increased 28%, to 9,483 Boe/d (72% liquids, 53% oil), for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the prior year.\nOur consolidated and combined financial statements are based on a number of significant estimates including quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves that are the basis for the calculations of DD&A and impairment of oil and natural gas properties. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas and there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, reserve estimates may differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. Our reserve estimates are audited by CG&A, an independent petroleum engineering firm. Other items subject to significant estimates and assumptions include the carrying amount of oil and natural gas properties, valuation of derivative instruments and revenue accruals.\nTotal revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 increased by 51%, or $34.2 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was attributable to a $38.1 million increase in mineral and royalty revenues during the period, partially offset by a $3.9 million decrease in lease bonus revenue. The increase in mineral and royalty revenues was primarily the result of increased drilling and completion activity on our mineral and royalty interests, which resulted in a 91% increase in production volumes to 7,414 Boe/d and a corresponding increase in revenue of $54.4 million. Realized commodity prices decreased 14% resulting in an additional $16.3 million decrease in mineral and royalty revenues.\nIn connection with the previously mentioned COVID-19 pandemic and resulting market and commodity price challenges experienced during 2020, we saw reduced levels of potential acquisition opportunities, which could potentially delay our ability to execute on our growth strategy. With an improvement in commodity prices along with our financial strength, we are well positioned to capture attractive opportunities in 2021 that will generate shareholder value. Given that our capital allocation is within our control, we believe that the liquidity provided by our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will provide us with sufficient capital to execute our current strategy.\nOil and Gas Properties\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nOn July 27, 2018, we entered into a credit agreement with Owl Rock Capital Corporation, as administrative agent and collateral agent (our Owl Rock credit facility\u201d). Our Owl Rock credit facility was subject to customary fees, guarantees of subsidiaries, restrictions and covenants, including certain restricted payments, and was collateralized by certain of our royalty and mineral properties.\nSeverance and Ad Valorem Taxes\nRevenues\n\nOil revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by 74%, or $35.0 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Oil production volumes increased 95% to 4,151 barrels per day resulting in a $44.7 million increase in oil revenues. The increase in oil production volumes for the period was primarily attributable to increased drilling and completion activity on our properties in Texas, Oklahoma, North Dakota and New Mexico. Realized oil prices decreased 11% to $54.16 per barrel resulting in a decrease in revenue of $9.7 million.\nOperating and other expenses\nOperational Update\nNet cash (used in)/provided by financing activities\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily a result of dividends paid to holders of our Class A common stock of $42.2 million, distributions to holders of temporary equity of $24.7 million, the repurchase of shares of our Class A common stock from the September 2020 Selling Shareholders for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $3.5 million, and payment related to employee tax withholding for settlement of share-based compensation awards of $1.2 million. This was partially offset by borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $20.0 million.\nThe Company expects any near-term production growth will be driven by the continued conversion of its DUC and permit inventory. Brigham's DUC and permit inventory as of December 31, 2020 by basin is outlined in the table below:\n\nThe following table provides the components of our revenues and expenses for the periods indicated, as well as each period's respective average prices and production volumes:\nPrinciple Components of Our Cost Structure\nGathering, transportation and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by 26%, or $1.0 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, which was largely driven by the increase in our production volumes, partially offset by lower gathering, transportation and marketing rates.\nGeneral and administrative ( G&A\u201d) expenses are costs incurred for overhead, including payroll and benefits for our staff, share-based compensation expense, costs of maintaining our headquarters, costs of managing our properties, audit and other fees for professional services and legal compliance. As a result of becoming a public company, we incurred incremental G&A expenses including, but not limited to, costs associated with hiring new personnel, implementation of compensation programs that are competitive with our public company peer group including share-based compensation, annual and quarterly reports to stockholders, tax return preparation, independent and internal auditor fees, investor relations activities, registrar and transfer agent fees, incremental director and officer liability insurance costs and independent director compensation. These incremental G&A expenses are not reflected in our historical financial statements before the IPO date.\nThe table below summarizes the Company's mineral and royalty interest ownership as of the dates indicated and changes in such ownership on an annual basis.\nDUC and Permit Inventory\nUse of Estimates\n\nIn April 2019, Brigham Minerals completed the IPO of 16,675,000 shares of Class A common stock at a price to the public of $18.00 per share. As a result of the IPO, Brigham Minerals became a holding company whose sole material asset consisted of a 43.3% interest in Brigham LLC, which wholly owns Brigham Resources. Brigham Resources continues to wholly own the Minerals Subsidiaries, which own all of Brigham Resources' operating assets. In connection with the IPO, Brigham Minerals became the sole managing member of Brigham LLC and is responsible for all operational, management and administrative decisions relating to Brigham LLC's business and consolidates the financial results of Brigham LLC and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Brigham Resources.\nMarket Environment and COVID-19\nOil and natural gas sales\nDividends\nDUC Conversions\nSources of Our Revenues\nMineral and Royalty Interest Ownership Update\nUnder the full cost method of accounting, total capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated depletion and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount equal to the present value of future net revenues from proved reserves, discounted at 10% per annum (\"PV-10\"), plus the cost of unevaluated properties, less related income tax effects (full cost ceiling limitation). A write-down of the carrying value of the full cost pool (\"impairment charge\") is a noncash charge that reduces earnings and impacts equity in the period of occurrence and typically results in lower depletion expense in future periods. A ceiling limitation is calculated at each reporting period. The ceiling limitation calculation is prepared using an unweighted arithmetic average of oil prices (\"SEC oil price\") and natural gas prices (\"SEC gas price\") as of the first day of each month for the trailing 12-month period ended, as required under the guidelines established by the SEC. As of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the SEC oil prices were $39.57, $55.65, and $65.66, respectively, per barrel for oil, adjusted by area for energy content, transportation fees and regional price differentials, and the SEC gas prices were $2.00, $2.60, and $3.12, respectively, per MMBtu for natural gas, adjusted by area for energy content, transportation fees and regional price differentials. As a result of the decline in the SEC oil prices and the SEC gas prices during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, and taking into consideration certain reclassifications of proved undeveloped reserves to probable and possible reserves during the three months ended December 31, 2020, as a result of a slowdown in operator activity, the net book value of oil and natural gas properties exceeded the ceiling limitation, as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020, resulting in an impairment charge of $79.6 million to oil and gas properties, net during the year ended December 31, 2020. There were no impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nLease bonus revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased by 52%, or $3.9 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in leasing activity on our interests in Oklahoma, partially offset by an increase in leasing activity in Texas. Other revenues include payments for right-of-way and surface damages and were not a significant portion of the overall amount.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt. As a result of the full repayment of the outstanding balance of the Owl Rock credit facility of $200.0 million in May 2019, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $6.9 million. The loss on extinguishment of debt consisted of a $4.0 million write-off of capitalized debt issuance costs, a $2.1 million prepayment fee and legal fees of $0.8 million. See Note 7-Long-Term Debt\u201d to the consolidated and combined financial statements of Brigham Minerals, Inc. as of December 31, 2019 included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion of these transactions.\nWorking Capital\nA complete list of our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our audited consolidated and combined financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nSales and abandonments of oil and natural gas properties being amortized are accounted for as adjustments to the full cost pool, with no gain or loss recognized unless the adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves. A significant alteration would not ordinarily be expected to occur upon the sale of reserves involving less than 25% of the reserve quantities of a cost center.\nWe periodically assess whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets, including net operating losses. In making this determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions. We consider, among other things, our deferred tax liabilities, the overall business environment, our historical earnings and losses, current industry trends and our outlook for future years.\nDuring 2020 the Company saw 381 gross (2.6 net) wells spud on its acreage. 54% of gross (70% net) wells spud were in the Permian Basin, with 35% gross (60% net) wells spud in the Delaware Basin and 19% gross (10% net) wells spud in the Midland Basin:\n\u2022commodity prices; and\nIn 2019, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (\"ASC 606\") using the modified retrospective approach, which only applied to contracts that were in effect as of the date of adoption. The adoption did not require an adjustment to opening retained earnings for the cumulative effect adjustment and did not impact our previously reported results of operations, nor our ongoing consolidated and combined balance sheets, statements of cash flow or statements of changes in shareholders' and members' equity. Overall, there were no material changes in the timing of the satisfaction of our performance obligations or the allocation of the transaction price to our performance obligations in applying the guidance in ASC 606 as compared to legacy U.S. GAAP.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our net cash used in investing activities was primarily a result of acquisitions of mineral and royalty interests totaling $219.5 million and additions to other fixed assets of $0.4 million, offset by sales of mineral and royalty interests totaling $3.1 million.\nFuture declines in the unweighted arithmetic average SEC oil prices used in the full cost ceiling test may result in additional impairment charges in the future and such impairments could be material. In addition to the impact of lower prices, any future changes to assumptions of drilling and completion activity, development timing, acquisitions or divestitures of oil and gas properties, proved undeveloped locations, and production and other estimates may require revisions to estimates of total proved reserves which would impact the amount of any impairment charge.\nLease bonus and other income\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nNGL revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by 29%, or $1.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in NGL revenues was primarily attributable to the 67% increase in NGL volumes to 1,858 Boe/d resulting in a $4.1 million increase in NGL sales was primarily attributable to increased drilling and completion activities on our properties in the Permian Basin. This was partially offset by a 23% decrease in NGL prices to $11.61 per barrel resulting in a decrease in revenue of $2.3 million.\nIn order to track and assess the performance of our assets, we monitor and analyze our production volumes from the various resource plays that comprise our portfolio of mineral and royalty interests. We also regularly compare projected volumes to actual reported volumes and investigate unexpected variances.\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ex lease bonus.\nShare-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $10.0 million net of $3.8 million of share-based compensation cost capitalized to unevaluated property. At IPO, we recognized a cumulative effect adjustment of $2.0 million of share-based compensation cost related to the Incentive Units, pertaining to the period from the grant date through the IPO. Additionally, in April of 2019, in connection with the IPO, we adopted the Brigham Minerals, Inc. 2019 LTIP and granted restricted stock awards (\"RSAs\"), restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and performance-based vesting units (\"PSUs\") to our employees and executives. Certain of the RSAs vested immediately and we recognized $3.2 million of share-based compensation cost related to the RSAs. Also, subsequent to the IPO and prior to December 31, 2019, we recognized an additional $8.6 million of share-based compensation cost related to the Incentive Units and the awards granted under the LTIP. No share-based compensation expenses were recognized prior to the IPO because the IPO was not considered probable. See Note 10-Share-Based Compensation\u201d to the consolidated and combined financial statements of Brigham Minerals, Inc. as of December 31, 2019 included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion.\nIn 2020, the Company identified approximately 628 gross DUCs (4.7 net DUCs) converted to production, representing 70% of its gross DUC inventory (79% of its net DUCs) as of year-end 2019. 2020 conversions of gross wells by status are summarized in the graph below:\nshares of its Class A common stock in the September 2020 Secondary Offering and did not receive any proceeds pursuant to the September 2020 Secondary Offering. In addition, in connection with the September 2020 Secondary Offering, Brigham Minerals repurchased 436,630 shares of its Class A common stock from the September 2020 Selling Shareholders in a privately negotiated transaction at a price equal to the price per share at which the underwriter purchased shares from the September 2020 Selling Shareholders in the September 2020 Secondary Offering (and Brigham LLC redeemed a corresponding number of Brigham LLC Units held by Brigham Minerals). The repurchased shares are presented in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet as Treasury Stock, at cost.\nOur working capital, which we define as current assets minus current liabilities, totaled $22.6 million as of December 31, 2020, as compared to $71.6 million at December 31, 2019. Our collection of receivables has historically been timely, and losses associated with uncollectible receivables have historically not been significant.\n\nNatural gas, which currently has a limited global transportation system, is subject to price variances based on local supply and demand conditions and the cost to transport natural gas to end-user markets.\nIPO were used to fully repay the outstanding borrowings under the Owl Rock credit facility. In December 2019, a portion of the net proceeds received from the December 2019 Offering were used to fully repay the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. See Note 7-Long-Term Debt\u201d and Note 1-Business and Basis of Presentation\u201d to the consolidated and combined financial statements of Brigham Minerals, Inc. as of December 31, 2019 included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion of this transaction.\n\u2022As of December 31, 2020, Brigham Minerals had a cash balance of $9.1 million and $115.0 million of capacity on our revolving credit facility, providing the Company with total liquidity of $124.1 million.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nQuality differentials result from the heating value of natural gas measured in Btus and the presence of impurities, such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide and nitrogen. Natural gas containing ethane and heavier hydrocarbons has a higher Btu value and will realize a higher volumetric price than natural gas that is predominantly methane, which has a lower Btu value. Natural gas with a higher concentration of impurities will realize a lower volumetric price due to the presence of the impurities in the natural gas when sold or the cost of treating the natural gas to meet pipeline quality specifications.\nNet cash provided by operating activities is primarily affected by production volumes, the prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs, lease bonus revenue and changes in working capital. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 is primarily due to improved collections of receivables and reduced payments for interest and income taxes, partly offset by increased payments for operating expenses.\nOn September 15, 2020, Brigham Minerals completed an offering of 5,021,140 shares of its Class A common stock, including 654,931 shares issued pursuant to the option granted to the underwriter to purchase additional shares to cover over-allotments (the \"September 2020 Secondary Offering\"), all of which were sold by certain shareholders of the Company (the \"September 2020 Selling Shareholders\"), and 3,062,011 of which represented shares issued upon redemption of an equivalent number of the September 2020 Selling Shareholders' Brigham LLC Units (together with a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock in Brigham Minerals), at a price to the public of $8.20 per share. Brigham Minerals did not sell any\nRevenues\nNatural gas revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by 7%, or $0.7 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in natural gas revenues was primarily attributable to the 23% increase in natural gas production volume to 15,871 Mcf/d resulting in a $2.3 million increase in natural gas sales. The increase in natural gas production volumes for the period was primarily attributable to increased drilling and completion activity on our properties in the Permian Basin. This was partially offset by a 13% decrease in realized natural gas price to $1.80 per Mcf resulting in a decrease in revenue of $1.6 million.\nLease bonus revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by 51%, or $1.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in leasing activity on our interests in Texas, partially offset by a decrease in leasing activity in Colorado and Oklahoma. Other revenues include payments for right-of-way and surface damages and were not a significant portion of the overall amount.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 included $46.0 million in net capital contributions from the Original Owners and $213.4 million in additional borrowings under our prior revolving credit facility and the Owl Rock credit facility combined, net of $4.6 million in associated loan closing costs. This was partially offset by payment of $70.0 million to pay off and terminate the prior revolving credit facility on July 28, 2018 using funds from the new term loan facility.\nVolumes of Oil, Natural Gas and NGLs Produced\nInternal Controls and Procedures\nOur revolving credit facility allows us to hedge up to 85% of our reasonably anticipated projected production from our proved reserves of oil and natural gas, calculated separately, for up to 60 months in the future. We did not have any natural gas or oil derivative contracts in place as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded a loss on commodity derivative instruments, net of $0.6 million and a gain of $0.4 million, respectively. See Note 5-Derivative Instruments\u201d to the consolidated and combined financial statements of Brigham Minerals included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nIn determining the full cost ceiling impairment at December 31, 2020, we estimated the PV-10 of our total proved oil and natural gas reserves using the SEC oil price and the SEC gas price of $39.57 per Bbl and $2.00 per MMBtu, respectively, which is a decrease of 29% and 23%, respectively, from the December 31, 2019 SEC oil price and SEC gas price of $55.65 per Bbl and $2.60 per MMBtu, respectively. No impairment charge was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, our net cash used in investing activities was primarily a result of acquisitions of mineral and royalty interests totaling $195.6 million and additions to other fixed assets of $0.7 million. Our cash flows from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 also reflects $0.9 million of proceeds from the sale of equity securities.\nThe following table presents the breakdown of our revenues for the following periods:\nThe following table provides the components of our revenues and expenses for the periods indicated, as well as each period's respective average prices and production volumes:\n\u2022volumes of oil, natural gas and NGLs produced;\nNatural gas volumes are converted to Boe at the rate of six thousand Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of oil. This convention is not an equivalent price basis and there may be a large difference in value between an equivalent volume of oil versus an equivalent volume of natural gas.\n\nPrior to entering into our Owl Rock credit facility (which was terminated in May 2019), we maintained a revolving credit facility (our prior revolving credit facility\u201d) with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain lenders party thereto with commitments of $150.0 million (subject to a borrowing base). We repaid the $70.0 million outstanding balance under our prior revolving credit facility with proceeds from our Owl Rock credit facility and terminated the prior revolving credit facility. The borrowing base at the time of termination was $70.0 million.\nFurther declines in the SEC oil price or the SEC gas price could lead to additional impairment charges in the future and such impairment charges could be material. In addition to the impact of lower prices, any future changes to assumptions of drilling and completion activity, development timing, acquisitions or divestitures of oil and gas properties, proved undeveloped locations, and production and other estimates may require revisions to estimates of total proved reserves which would impact the amount of any impairment charge. Based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development activities, production data, economics and other factors, we may be required to write down the carrying value of our properties in future periods. The risk that we will be required to recognize impairments of our oil, natural gas and NGL properties increases during sustained periods of low commodity prices. In addition, impairments could occur if we were to experience sufficient downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or the present value of estimated future net revenues. If we incur impairment charges in the future, our results of operations for the periods in which such charges are taken may be materially and adversely affected.\nBrigham Minerals is subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes as a corporation. Texas imposes a franchise tax (commonly referred to as the Texas margin tax) at a rate of up to 1.00% on gross revenues less certain deductions, as specifically set forth in the Texas margin tax statute. A portion of our mineral and royalty interests are located in Texas basins. Our predecessor was treated as a flow-through entity, and is currently treated as a disregarded entity, for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, is generally not subject to U.S. federal income tax at the entity level.\nReceivables consist of mineral and royalty income due from operators for oil and gas sales to purchasers. Those purchasers remit payment for production to the operator of the properties and the operator, in turn, remits payment to us. Receivables from third parties for which we did not receive actual information, either due to timing delays or due to the unavailability of data at the time when revenues are recognized, are estimated. Volume estimates for wells with available historical actual data are based upon (i) the historical actual data for the months the data is available, or (ii) engineering estimates for the months the historical actual data is not available. We do not recognize revenues for wells with no historical actual data because we cannot conclude that it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in future periods. Pricing estimates are based upon actual prices realized in an area by adjusting the market price for the average basis differential from market on a basin-by-basin basis.\nAdjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ex lease bonus do not represent and should not be considered alternatives to, or more meaningful than, net income, income from operations, cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP as measures of our financial performance. Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ex lease bonus have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Our computation of Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ex lease bonus may differ from computations of similarly titled measures of other companies. For further discussion, please read Item 6 - Selected Financial Data-Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\nWe engage CG&A, our independent petroleum engineering firm, to audit our total estimated proved, probable and possible reserves. We expect proved, probable and possible reserve estimates will change as additional information becomes available and as commodity prices and costs change. We evaluate and estimate our proved, probable and possible reserves internally each quarter and CG&A audits our proved, probable and possible reserves annually. Reserve estimates are inherently imprecise. Accordingly, the estimates are expected to change as more current information becomes available. The estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves are based upon the use of technical and economic data including, but not limited to, well logs, geologic maps, seismic data, well test data, production data, historical price and cost information, historical and future operator development plans, and property ownership interests. Standard engineering and geoscience methods, such as reservoir modeling, performance analysis, volumetric analysis and analogy, which are considered to be appropriate and necessary to establish reserve quantities and reserve categorization that conform to SEC definitions and rules and regulations, are also used. As in all aspects of oil and natural gas evaluation, there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of engineering and geoscience data; therefore, these estimates necessarily represent only informed professional judgment.\n\u2022Our mineral and royalty revenues composed of crude oil, natural gas and NGL sales decreased 12%, to $86.2 million, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the prior year.\nAdjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ex lease bonus are non-GAAP supplemental financial measures used by our management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors, research analysts and others to assess the financial performance of our assets and their ability to sustain dividends over the long term without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt. As a result of the full repayment of the outstanding balance of the Owl Rock credit facility of $200.0 million in May 2019, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $6.9 million for the\nWe routinely review outstanding balances, assess the financial strength of our operators and record a reserve for amounts not expected to be fully recovered. We recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of $0.3 million, $0.6 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nAvailability under our revolving credit facility is governed by a borrowing base, which is subject to redetermination in May and November of each year. In addition, lenders holding two-thirds of the aggregate commitments may request one additional redetermination each year. Brigham Resources can also request one additional redetermination each year, and such other redeterminations as appropriate when significant acquisition opportunities arise. The borrowing base is subject to further adjustments for asset dispositions, material title deficiencies, certain terminations of hedge agreements and issuances of permitted additional indebtedness. Increases to the borrowing base require unanimous approval of the lenders, while decreases only require approval of lenders holding two-thirds of the aggregate commitments at such time. As of December 31, 2020, the borrowing base on our revolving credit facility was $135.0 million, with outstanding borrowings of $20.0 million, resulting in $115.0 million availability for future borrowings.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company completed 81 transactions acquiring 4,635 net royalty acres (standardized to a 1/8th royalty interest) for $66.5 million, in the Permian, SCOOP/STACK/Merge, Williston and DJ Basins. The Company deployed approximately 92% of its mineral acquisition capital in 2020 to the Permian Basin (70% Delaware and 22% Midland), 4% to the Anadarko Basin, 2% to the Williston Basin and 2% to the DJ Basin. The acquired minerals are expected to deliver near-term production and cash flow growth with the addition of 165 gross DUCs (0.6 net DUCs) and 97 gross permits (0.3 net permits) to our inventory counts. As of December 31, 2020, the Company owned roughly 86,285 net royalty acres, encompassing 13,496 gross (116.3 net) undeveloped horizontal locations, across 37 counties in what the Company views as the core of the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico, the SCOOP/STACK plays in the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma, the DJ Basin in Colorado and Wyoming and the Williston Basin in North Dakota.\nWe earn revenue from lease bonuses, delay rentals, and right-of-way payments. We generate lease bonus revenue by leasing our mineral interests to exploration and production companies. A lease agreement represents our contract with a customer and generally transfers the rights to any oil or natural gas discovered, grants us a right to a specified royalty interest, and requires that drilling and completion operations commence within a specified time period. We recognize lease bonus revenues when the lease agreement has been executed, payment has been received, and we have no further obligation to refund the payment. At the time we execute the lease agreement, we expect to receive the lease bonus payment within a reasonable\nNet cash provided by operating activities\nOwl Rock Credit Facility\nResults of Operations\n(1) As of December 31, 2020, the borrowing base on our revolving credit facility was $135.0 million, with outstanding borrowings of $20.0 million, resulting in $115.0 million availability for future borrowings.\n(1) Hedge prices reflect the effect of our commodity derivative transactions on our average sales prices. Our calculation of such effects include realized gains and losses on cash settlements for commodity derivatives, which we do not designate for hedge accounting.\nOverview\nIncome Tax Expense\n\u2022Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $58.0 million. Adjusted Net Income was $7.1 million, excluding an after-tax impairment to oil and gas properties of $65.1 million. Our net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was $21.6 million, while Adjusted Net Income was $27.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ex lease bonus decreased 17% to $65.0 million, and 20% to $59.6 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the prior year. Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ex lease bonus are non-GAAP financial measures. For a definition of Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ex lease bonus and a reconciliation to our most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, please read \"How We Evaluate Our Operations-Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Ex Lease Bonus.\"\nOur revenues are primarily derived from the mineral and royalty payments we receive from our operators based on the sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs produced from our properties, as well as from lease bonus payments. Mineral and royalty revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in volumes of production sold by our operators, production mix and commodity prices. Lease bonus revenues vary from period to period as a result of leasing activity on our mineral interests.\nIt is possible that, because of changes in market conditions or the inherent imprecision of reserve estimates, the estimates of future cash inflows, future gross revenue, the amount of oil and natural gas reserves, the remaining estimated lives of oil and natural gas properties or any combination of the above may be increased or reduced. Increases in recoverable economic volumes generally reduce per unit depletion rates while decreases in recoverable economic volumes generally increase per unit depletion rates.\nNatural gas revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by 39%, or $2.7 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Natural gas production volumes increased 88% to 12,896 Mcf/d resulting in a $6.1 million increase in natural gas sales. The increase in natural gas production volumes for the period was primarily attributable to increased drilling and completion activity on our properties in Oklahoma, Colorado, North Dakota, Texas and New Mexico. Realized natural gas prices decreased by 26% to $2.07 per Mcf resulting in a decrease in revenue of $3.4 million.\n(1) Hedged prices reflect the effect of our commodity derivative transactions on our average sales prices. Our calculation of such effects include realized gains and losses on cash settlements for commodity derivatives, which we do not designate for hedge accounting.\nOil revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by 17%, or $14.1 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in oil revenues was primarily attributable to the 31% decrease in realized oil price to $37.26 per barrel resulting in a decrease in revenue of $30.8 million. This was partially offset by a 20% increase in oil production volumes to 4,980 barrels per day resulting in a $16.7 million increase in oil revenues. The increase in oil production volumes for the period was primarily attributable to increased drilling and completion activity on our properties in the Permian Basin.\nSTACK plays in the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma, the DJ Basin in Colorado and Wyoming and the Williston Basin in North Dakota.\nThe prices we receive for oil, natural gas and NGLs vary by geographical area. The relative prices of these products are determined by factors affecting global and regional supply and demand dynamics, such as economic and geopolitical conditions, production levels, availability of transportation, weather cycles and other factors. In addition, realized prices are influenced by product quality and proximity to consuming and refining markets. Any differences between realized prices and NYMEX prices are referred to as differentials. All of our production is derived from properties located in the United States.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\n(1) Dividends paid to holders of Class A common stock.\nPrior to our IPO, our primary sources of liquidity were capital contributions from our Original Owners, borrowings under our debt arrangements and cash flows from operations. Subsequent to our IPO, our current primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and proceeds from any primary issuances of equity securities. Future sources of liquidity may also include other credit facilities we may enter into in the future and additional issuances of debt or equity securities. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the decline in commodities prices, coupled with many of our operators announcing significant reductions in projected capital expenditures in 2020 and beyond, our revenues and cash flows from operations have been and may continue to be negatively impacted and we may not have access to capital markets on terms favorable to us or at all.\nGathering, Transportation and Marketing Expenses\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, Brigham Minerals reduced its proved undeveloped reserves by 8,209 MBoe primarily due to a reclassification of 7,036 MBoe from proved undeveloped reserves to probable and possible reserves, as a result of decreased rig activity, a 29% reduction in SEC oil prices over the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, and conversion from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves. The reduction in rig activity led to changes in the development timing and a reduction of the number of proved undeveloped locations that Brigham Minerals expects will be developed within five years after the date of booking.\n\n\nShare-Based Compensation\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 included the combined net proceeds generated from the IPO and December 2019 Offering of $379.8 million offset by the combined full repayment of the outstanding balances of the Owl Rock credit facility and revolving credit facility of $175.0 million (net of additional borrowings of $105.0 million incurred during the year), dividends paid to holders of our Class A common stock of $14.7 million, distributions to holders of temporary equity of $20.1 million, payment of debt extinguishment fees of $2.1 million and payment of loan closing costs of $1.3 million.\nGeneral and administrative expense (before share-based compensation expense) for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by 79%, or $5.3 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Increases to G&A expense are a result of: (i) $0.7 million of incremental audit and tax fees, (ii) $0.7 million of additional salaries due to increase in headcount, (iii) $1.1 million of incremental D&O insurance expenses, (iv) $1.1 million of legal and professional fees and (v) $1.7 million of other incremental expenses as a result of becoming a publicly traded company.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the potential risk to our workforce and in compliance with stay at home orders, we successfully implemented policies and the technological infrastructure for all of our employees to work from home in the first quarter of 2020 and ceased all business travel. In compliance with the requirements for the re-opening of the Texas economy, we are currently operating our office at 75% capacity while continuing to support working from home for our employees that are considered high-risk pursuant to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines or have household members meeting the criteria of the guidelines. Due to these efforts, we have not experienced material disruptions to our operations or the health of our workforce.\nOn June 12, 2020, Brigham Minerals completed an offering of 6,600,000 shares of its Class A common stock (the \"June 2020 Secondary Offering\"), all of which were sold by certain shareholders of the Company (the June 2020 Selling Shareholders\u201d), and 4,872,669 of which represented shares issued upon redemption of an equivalent number of the June 2020 Selling Shareholders' Brigham LLC Units (together with a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock in Brigham Minerals), at a price to the public of $13.75 per share. Brigham Minerals did not sell any shares of its common stock in the June 2020 Secondary Offering and did not receive any proceeds pursuant to the June 2020 Secondary Offering.\nBrigham Minerals was formed to acquire and actively manage a portfolio of mineral and royalty interests in the core of what we view as the most active, highly economic, liquids-rich resource plays across the continental United States. Our primary business objective is to maximize risk-adjusted total return to our shareholders through (i) the growth of our free cash flow generated from our existing portfolio of approximately 86,285 net royalty acres, and (ii) the continued sourcing and execution of accretive mineral acquisitions in the core of highly economic, liquids-rich resource plays. As of December 31, 2020, we owned 86,285 net royalty acres across 37 counties within the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico, the SCOOP/\nCash Flows\n(1) Individual amounts may not total due to rounding.\nLoss on derivative instruments, net. Brigham Minerals did not have any derivative contracts in place as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Prior to December 31, 2019, we had certain oil swap contracts based on the NYMEX futures index. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized a loss on derivative instruments, net of $0.6 million, which is attributable to oil derivative instruments. We realized $0.5 million of gains on our settled derivative instruments during the year ended December 31, 2019. See Note 5-Derivative Instruments\u201d to the consolidated and combined financial statements of Brigham Minerals included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion of these transactions.\nThe ongoing global spread of a novel strain of coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2), which causes COVID-19, has caused a continuing disruption to the oil and natural gas industry and to our business by, among other things, contributing to a significant decrease in demand for crude oil and the price for oil beginning in the first quarter of 2020 and continuing through the fourth quarter of 2020. Additionally, in March 2020, Saudi Arabia and Russia failed to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls within OPEC and Russia. Subsequently, Saudi Arabia announced plans to increase production and reduce the prices at which they sell oil. While OPEC+ subsequently agreed to collectively decrease production, these events, combined with the macro-economic impact of the continued outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and declining availability of hydrocarbon storage, exacerbated the decline in commodity prices, including the historic, record low price of negative ($36.98) per barrel that occurred in April 2020. Additionally, in July 2020, OPEC+ agreed to begin easing production cuts starting in August 2020. Market volatility has continued, and we expect it will continue for the foreseeable future. Please see Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d for further discussion of these events.\nTotal revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by 10%, or $9.8 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was attributable to a $11.6 million decrease in mineral and royalty revenues during the period, partially offset by a $1.8 million increase in lease bonus revenue. The decrease in mineral and royalty revenues was primarily the result of a decrease in realized commodity prices of 31% resulting in a $39.3 million decrease in mineral and royalty revenues. This was partially offset by an increase in drilling and completion activity on our mineral and royalty interests, and to a lesser degree by acquisitions of proved developed producing reserves, which resulted in a 28% increase in production volumes to 9,483 Boe/d and a corresponding increase in mineral and royalty revenues of $27.7 million.\nWe define Adjusted Net Income as net income (loss) before impairment of oil and gas properties, after tax, and loss on extinguishment of debt, after tax. We define Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted Net Income before depreciation, depletion and amortization, share based compensation expense, interest expense, gain or loss on derivative instruments and income tax\nIncome Taxes\nThe following is a description of the principle components of our cost structure. However, as an owner of mineral and royalty interests, we are not obligated to fund drilling and completion capital expenditures to bring a horizontal well on line, lease operating expenses to produce our oil, natural gas and NGLs nor the plugging and abandonment costs at the end of a well's economic life. All the aforementioned costs are borne entirely by the exploration and production companies that have leased our mineral and royalty interests.\nG&A for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by 18%, or $2.2 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Increases to G&A expense are a result of: (i) $0.7 million in incremental legal, professional, audit, and tax fees as a result of the Company's June 2020 Secondary Offering and September 2020 Secondary Offering, (ii) $0.5 million in additional rent expense, (iii) $0.4 million of incremental directors and officers insurance expenses, and (iv) $0.3 million of additional salaries due to an increase in headcount.\nReceivables\nCorporate Reorganization and Transactions\nOil. The substantial majority of our oil production is sold at prevailing market prices, which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of our control. NYMEX light sweet crude oil, commonly referred to as WTI, is the prevailing domestic oil pricing index. The majority of our oil production is priced at the prevailing market price with the final realized price affected by both quality and location differentials.\nWe are an emerging growth company,\u201d under the JOBS Act, which allows us to take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act.\nGeneral and Administrative\n\u2022number of rigs on location, permits, spuds, completions and wells turned-in-line;\nThe corporate reorganization that was completed contemporaneously with the closing of the IPO provided a mechanism by which the Brigham LLC Units to be allocated amongst the Original Owners, including the holders of our management incentive units, was determined. As a result, the satisfaction of all conditions relating to the vesting of certain management incentive units held in Brigham Equity Holdings, LLC ( Brigham Equity Holdings\u201d) by our management and employees became probable. Accordingly, at IPO, we recognized a cumulative effect adjustment to share-based compensation cost of approximately $2.0 million pertaining to the period from the grant date through the IPO date, related to the estimated fair value of the Incentive Units (as defined in Note 10-Share-based Compensation-LLC Incentive Units\u201d to the consolidated and combined financial statements of Brigham Minerals included elsewhere in this Annual Report) at grant, all of which was non-cash.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Ex Lease Bonus\nSeverance taxes are paid on produced oil, natural gas or NGLs based on either a percentage of revenues from production sold or the number of units of production sold at fixed rates established by federal, state or local taxing authorities. In general, the production taxes we pay correlate to changes in our oil, natural gas and NGL revenues, which is driven by our production volumes and prices received for our oil, natural gas and NGLs. We are also subject to ad valorem taxes in some of the counties where our production is located. Ad valorem taxes are generally based on the state or local government's appraisal of the value of our oil, natural gas and NGL properties, which also trend with anticipated production, as well as oil, natural gas and NGL prices. Rates, methods of calculating property values and timing of payments vary across the different counties in which we own mineral and royalty interests.\nNet cash used in investing activities is primarily composed of acquisitions of mineral and royalty interests, net of dispositions. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our net cash used in investing activities was primarily a result of acquisitions of mineral and royalty interests totaling $66.5 million and other fixed assets totaling $0.5 million, offset by sales of mineral and royalty interests totaling $1.6 million.\nwe are able to pay our stockholders have continued to be negatively impacted. We cannot predict the extent and duration of these and other impacts on our business from the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts to fight the pandemic and other market events.\nAs a mineral and royalty interest owner, we incur the initial cost to acquire our interests, but thereafter do not incur any development capital expenditures or lease operating expenses, which are entirely borne by the operator. As a result, the vast majority of our capital expenditures are related to our acquisition of additional mineral and royalty interests. The amount and allocation of future acquisition-related capital expenditures will depend upon a number of factors, including the number and size of acquisition opportunities, our cash flows from operations, investing and financing activities and our ability to assimilate acquisitions. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we deployed approximately $72.7 million for acquisition-related capital expenditures, inclusive of a $6.1 million capitalized share-based compensation cost. We periodically assess changes in current and projected free cash flows, acquisition and divestiture activities, debt requirements and other factors to determine the effects\nFollowing the completion of the September 2020 Secondary Offering and as of December 31, 2020, Brigham Minerals owned a 76.8% interest in Brigham LLC and the Original Owners owned 23.2% of the outstanding voting stock of Brigham Minerals. Certain other entities affiliated with Yorktown Partners LLC and Pine Brook Road Advisors, LP, which are a subset of the Company's Original Owners, collectively owned 16.9% of the outstanding voting stock of Brigham Minerals as of December 31, 2020.\nCosts associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the amortizable cost base until a determination has been made as to the existence of proved reserves. Unevaluated properties are reviewed periodically to determine whether the costs incurred should be reclassified to the full cost pool and subjected to amortization. The costs associated with unevaluated properties primarily consist of acquisition and leasehold costs and capitalized interest. Unevaluated properties are assessed for impairment on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant. The assessment includes consideration of the following factors, among others: expectation of future drilling activity; past drilling results and activity; geological and geophysical evaluations; the assignment of proved reserves; and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned. During any period in which these factors indicate an impairment, the cumulative acquisition costs incurred to date for such property are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to amortization. There was no impairment recorded for unevaluated properties for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nexpense, less other income, gain on sale of oil and gas properties and income tax benefit. We define Adjusted EBITDA ex lease bonus as Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted to eliminate the impacts of lease bonus revenue we receive due to the unpredictability of timing and magnitude of the revenue.\nAnalysis of Cash Flow Changes Between the Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nFinancial and Operational Overview:\nBrigham Minerals accounts for the Original Owners' 23.2% interest in Brigham LLC (as of December 31, 2020) as temporary equity as a result of certain redemption rights held by the Original Owners as discussed in Note 9-Temporary Equity\u201d to the consolidated and combined financial statements of Brigham Minerals included elsewhere in this Annual Report. As such, Brigham Minerals adjusts temporary equity to its maximum redemption amount at the balance sheet date, if higher than the carrying amount. The redemption amount is based on the 10-day volume-weighted average closing price ( VWAP\u201d) of Class A shares at the end of the reporting period. Changes in the redemption value are recognized immediately as they occur, as if the end of the reporting period was also the redemption date for the instrument, with an offsetting entry to additional paid-in capital. Temporary equity is reclassified to permanent equity (i) upon Conversion of Class B common stock (and an equivalent number of Brigham LLC Units) to Class A common stock, or (ii) when holders of Class B common stock no longer control a majority of the votes of the board of directors through direct representation on the board of directors, and no longer control the determination of whether to make a cash payment upon a Brigham Unit Holder's exercise of its Redemption Right.\nUnder the full cost method of accounting, total capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated depletion and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount equal to the present value of future net revenues from proved reserves, discounted at 10% per annum (\"PV-10\"), plus the cost of unevaluated properties, less related income tax effects (full cost ceiling limitation). A write-down of the carrying value of the full cost pool (\"impairment charge\") is a noncash charge that reduces earnings and impacts equity in the period of occurrence and typically results in lower depletion expense in future periods. A ceiling limitation is calculated at each reporting period. The ceiling limitation calculation is prepared using the unweighted arithmetic average of oil price (\"SEC oil price\") and natural gas price (\"SEC gas price\") as of the first day of each month for the trailing 12-month period ended, as required under the guidelines established by the SEC. As of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the SEC oil prices were $39.57, $55.65, and $65.66, respectively, per barrel for oil, further adjusted by area for energy content, transportation fees and regional price differentials and the SEC gas prices were $2.00, $2.60, and $3.12, respectively, per MMBtu for natural gas, further adjusted by area for energy content, transportation fees and regional price differentials. As a result of the decline in the SEC oil prices and SEC gas prices during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, and taking into consideration certain reclassification of proved undeveloped reserves to probable and possible reserves during the three months ended December 31, 2020, as a result of a slowdown in operator activity, the net book value of oil and natural gas properties exceeded the ceiling limitation as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020, resulting in an impairment charge of $79.6 million to oil and gas properties, net during the year ended December 31, 2020. There were no impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nContractual Obligations\nWe may enter into certain derivative instruments to partially mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility on our cash flow generated from operations. From time to time, such instruments may include variable-to-fixed-price swaps, fixed-price contracts, costless collars and other contractual arrangements. The impact of these derivative instruments could affect the amount of cash flows we ultimately realize. Historically, we have only entered into minimal fixed-price swap contracts. Under fixed-price swap contracts, a counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price is less than the swap strike price. Conversely, we are required to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price is greater than the swap strike price. We may employ contractual arrangements other than fixed-price swap contracts in the future to mitigate the impact of price fluctuations. If commodity prices decline in the future, our hedging contracts may partially mitigate the effect of lower prices on our future revenue.\nOur primary uses of capital are for the payment of dividends to our stockholders and for investing in our business, specifically the acquisition of additional mineral and royalty interests. In connection with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the announced reductions in projected capital expenditures by our operators, our cash flows from operations have been and may continue to be negatively impacted, and as a result, the dividend amount we are able to pay our stockholders has been and may also continue to be negatively impacted.\nBrigham Minerals accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated by applying existing tax laws and the rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe decision to pay any future dividends is solely within the discretion of, and subject to approval by, our board of directors. Our board of directors' determination with respect to any such dividends, including the record date, the payment date and the actual amount of the dividend, will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors that the board deems relevant at the time of such determination. See \"Item 5 - Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities-Dividend Policy\" for further discussion of our dividend policy.\n*** A percentage calculation is not meaningful due to change in signs, zero-value denominator or a change greater than 300.\nAs of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020, the net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceeded the full cost ceiling limitation primarily due to the decline in oil and gas prices and reclassification of proved undeveloped reserves to probable and possible reserves during the three months ended December 31, 2020 as a result of a slowdown in operator activity. As a result, we recorded impairments of our oil and gas properties, net of $79.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization ( DD&A\u201d) is the systematic expensing of the capitalized costs incurred to acquire evaluated oil and natural gas properties. We use the full cost method of accounting, and, as such, all acquisition-related costs to acquire evaluated properties are capitalized and amortized in aggregate based on the estimated economic productive lives of our properties. Depletion is the expense recorded based on the cost basis of our properties and the volume of hydrocarbons extracted during each respective period, calculated on a units-of-production basis. Estimates of proved reserves are a major component of our calculation of depletion. We adjust our depletion rates quarterly based upon the quarter-end internally generated reserve reports unless circumstances indicate that there has been a significant change in reserves or costs. The year-end reserve reports are audited by CG&A.\nOur revolving credit facility matures on May 16, 2024. Loans drawn under our revolving credit facility may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty (other than customary LIBOR breakage) and must be prepaid in the event that exposure exceeds the lesser of the borrowing base and the elected availability at such time. The principal amount of loans that are prepaid are required to be accompanied by accrued and unpaid interest and fees on such amounts. Loans that are prepaid may be reborrowed. In addition, Brigham Resources may permanently reduce or terminate in full the commitments under our revolving credit facility prior to maturity. Any excess exposure resulting from such permanent reduction or termination must be prepaid. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our revolving credit facility, the administrative agent acting at the direction of the lenders holding a majority of the aggregate commitments at such time may accelerate outstanding loans and terminate all\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized a loss on derivative instruments, net of $0.6 million, which is attributable to oil derivative instruments. We realized $0.5 million of gains on our settled derivative instruments during the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized a net gain on derivative instruments of $0.4 million, which is attributable to derivative instruments based on the price of oil. We realized $0.8 million of losses on our settled derivative instruments during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOil, natural gas and NGLs sales revenues are generally recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer, the performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with customers are satisfied and collectability is reasonably assured. As a non-operator, we have limited visibility into the timing of when new wells start producing and production statements may not be received for 30 to 90 days or more after the date production is delivered. As a result, we are required to estimate the amount of production delivered to the purchaser and the price that we will receive for the sale of the product. The expected sales volumes and prices for these properties are estimated and recorded within the Accounts receivable line item in the accompanying consolidated and combined balance sheets. The difference between our estimates and the actual amounts received for oil and natural gas sales is recorded in the month that payment is received from the third party.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations", "item_7_text": "\nyear ended December 31, 2019. The loss on extinguishment of debt consisted of a $4.0 million write-off of capitalized debt issuance costs, a $2.1 million prepayment fee and legal fees of $0.8 million. See Note 7-Long-Term Debt\u201d to the consolidated and combined financial statements of Brigham Minerals included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion of these transactions.\nIn order to track and assess the performance of our assets, we monitor and analyze the number of rigs currently drilling our properties. We also constantly monitor the number of permits, spuds, completions and wells on production that are applicable to our mineral and royalty interests in an effort to evaluate near-term production growth from the various basins and resource plays that comprise our asset base.\nOn May 16, 2019 (the closing date\u201d), Brigham Resources entered into a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent for the various lenders from time to time party thereto, providing for a revolving credit facility (our revolving credit facility\u201d). Our revolving credit facility is guaranteed by Brigham Resources' domestic subsidiaries and is collateralized by a lien on substantial portion of Brigham Resources and its domestic subsidiaries' assets, including substantial portion of their respective royalty and mineral properties.\nCommodity Prices\nAs of December 31, 2020, our liquidity was as follows:\nOur revolving credit facility bears interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, the adjusted base rate or the adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on utilization of our revolving credit facility and ranges from (a) in the case of adjusted base rate loans, 0.750% to 1.750% and (b) in the case of adjusted LIBOR rate loans, 1.750% to 2.750%. Brigham Resources may elect an interest period of one, two, three, six, or if available to all lenders, twelve months. Interest is payable in arrears at the end of each interest period, but no less frequently than quarterly. A commitment fee is payable quarterly in arrears on the daily undrawn available commitments under our revolving credit facility in an amount ranging from 0.375% to 0.500% based on utilization of our revolving credit facility. Our revolving credit facility is subject to other customary fee, interest and expense reimbursement provisions.\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization\nOur future results of operations may not be comparable to our historical results of operations for the periods presented, primarily for the reasons described below.\nSee Note 2-Significant Accounting Policies-Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\u201d in our consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.\nThe historical consolidated and combined financial statements included in this Annual Report for periods on or before April 23, 2019 are based on the financial statements of our predecessor and Brigham Minerals prior to our corporate reorganization consummated in connection with our IPO. As a result, such historical consolidated and combined financial data may not give you an accurate indication of what our actual results would have been if the corporate reorganization had been completed at the beginning of the periods presented or of what our future results of operations are likely to be.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nHedging\nDrilling Activity\nThe declining commodity prices have adversely affected the revenues we receive for our royalty interests and could affect our ability to access the capital markets on terms favorable to us. Additionally, in response to the declining commodity prices, many operators on our properties substantially reduced their capital expenditures during 2020 and have announced similarly reduced capital expenditures for 2021 and beyond, which has adversely affected the development of our properties and will continue to affect the development of our properties into 2021 and beyond. While these lower commodity prices initially resulted in some of the Company's operators shutting in or curtailing production from wells on its properties during the second quarter of 2020, the Company saw a majority of its operators resume production for previously curtailed and shut in wells in connection with the improvement of commodity prices in the third and fourth quarters of 2020. As a result of the shut-ins in the second quarter of 2020 and the depressed commodity prices, our revenues, cash flows from operations and dividend amounts\nAs of December 31, 2020, we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nThe preparation of consolidated and combined financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated and combined financial statements and accompanying notes. Although management believes these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are recorded prospectively.\nCapital Requirements and Sources of Liquidity\nOur Owl Rock credit facility provided for a $125.0 million initial term loan and a $75.0 million delayed draw term loan ( DDTL\u201d). Also, a $10.0 million revolving credit facility was available for general corporate purposes, which was undrawn as of May 7, 2019. Our Owl Rock credit facility bore interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, (a) the base rate plus 4.50%, or (b) the adjusted LIBOR rate for such interest period (subject to a 1.00% floor) plus 5.50%. We used a portion of the proceeds from the IPO to repay the outstanding borrowings under the term loan portion and DDTL portion of our Owl Rock credit facility and terminated the Owl Rock credit facility on May 7, 2019. See Note 7-Long-Term Debt\u201d to the consolidated and combined financial statements of Brigham Minerals included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion.\non our liquidity. Based upon our current oil, natural gas and NGL price expectations for the year ended December 31, 2021, we believe that our cash flow from operations and additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility will provide us with sufficient liquidity to execute our current strategy. However, our ability to generate cash is subject to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including commodity prices, weather and general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors. If we require additional capital for acquisitions or other reasons, we may seek such capital through additional borrowings, joint venture partnerships, asset sales, offerings of equity and debt securities or other means. If we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms, we may not be able to complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us.\nSeverance and ad valorem taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by 13%, or $0.8 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the 12% decrease in mineral and royalty revenues.\nOil and Gas Properties\nThe increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily due to: (i) a 91% increase in production volumes and the 14% decrease in realized prices during the year ended December 31, 2019 discussed above; (ii) increases in operating expenses; and (iii) lower lease bonus revenues.\nCapitalized costs are amortized using the units-of-production method. Under this method, the provision for depletion is calculated by multiplying total production for the period by a depletion rate. The depletion rate is determined by dividing the total unamortized cost base by the net equivalent proved reserves at the beginning of the period.\nNumber of Rigs on Location, Permits, Spuds, Completions and Wells Turned-In-Line\nNGL revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by 7%, or $0.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. NGL production volumes increased by 83% to 1,114 Boe/d resulting in a $4.8 million increase in NGL sales, while realized NGL prices decreased by 42% to $15.03 per barrel resulting in a decrease in revenue of $4.4 million.\nBrigham Minerals accounts for its share-based compensation, including grants of the Incentive Units, restricted stock awards, time-based restricted stock units and performance-based stock units, in the condensed consolidated and combined statements of operations based on their estimated fair values at grant date. Brigham Minerals uses a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the fair value of performance-based stock units. Brigham Minerals recognizes expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the respective grant, which is generally the requisite service period. Brigham Minerals capitalizes a portion of the share-based compensation cost to oil and gas properties on the consolidated and combined balance sheets. Share-based compensation expense is included in general and administrative expenses in Brigham Minerals' consolidated and combined statements of operations included within this Annual Report. There was approximately $17.0 million of unamortized compensation expense relating to outstanding awards at December 31, 2020, a portion of which will be capitalized. The unrecognized compensation expense will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining vesting periods of the awards. Brigham Minerals accounts for forfeitures as they occur.\nBrigham Minerals is subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes as a corporation. Our predecessor was treated as a flow-through entity, and is currently treated as a disregarded entity, for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, is generally not subject to U.S. federal income tax at the entity level. Rather, the tax liability with respect to its taxable income is passed through to its members, including Brigham Minerals. Accordingly, the financial data of our predecessor contains no provision for U.S. federal income taxes or income taxes in any state or locality (other than franchise tax in the State of Texas).\nWe use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties. Under this method, all acquisition costs incurred for the purpose of acquiring mineral and royalty interests and certain related employee costs are capitalized into a full cost pool. Costs associated with general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred.\nIt should not be assumed that the standardized measure included in this report as of December 31, 2020 is the current market value of our estimated proved reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we based the 2020 standardized measure on the SEC oil price and SEC gas price as of December 31, 2020, and prevailing costs on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs utilized in the estimate. See Item 1 - Business-Oil, Natural Gas, and NGLs Data-Proved, Probable and Possible Reserves\u201d and Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d for additional information regarding estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves.\nPrior Revolving Credit Facility\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated and combined financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated and combined financial statements requires it to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Changes in facts and circumstances or additional information may result in revised estimates, and actual results may differ from these estimates.\n*** A percentage calculation is not meaningful due to change in signs, zero-value denominator or a change greater than 300.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Item 6 - Selected Financial Data\u201d and the accompanying consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nHistorically, oil, natural gas and NGL prices have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. During the past five years, the posted price for WTI has ranged from a historic, record low price of negative ($36.98) per barrel in April 2020 to a high of $77.41 per barrel in June 2018. The Henry Hub spot market price for natural gas has ranged from a low of $1.33 per MMBtu in September 2020 to a high of $6.24 per MMBtu in January 2018. As of December 31, 2020, the posted price for oil was $48.35 per barrel and the Henry Hub spot market price of natural gas was $2.36 per MMBtu. Lower prices may not only decrease our revenues, but also potentially the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs that our operators can produce economically.\n\nWe use a variety of operational and financial measures to assess our performance. Among the measures considered by management are the following:\nShare-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by 25%, or $2.5 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in share-based compensation expense was due to a cumulative effect adjustment of $5.2 million pertaining to the period from the grant date to the IPO, which consists of a $2.0 million cumulative effect adjustment related to the estimated fair value of the Incentive Units and a $3.2 million cumulative effect adjustment related to the estimated fair value of the RSAs, partially offset by share-based compensation expense related to awards granted during the year ended December 31, 2020. Brigham Minerals capitalizes a portion of the share-based compensation cost incurred after the IPO. See table below and \"Note 10-Share-Based Compensation\" to the consolidated and combined financial statements of Brigham Minerals included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased by $1.8 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 due to lower average outstanding borrowings and lower average interest rates. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our weighted average debt outstanding on our Owl Rock credit facility and revolving credit facility combined was $55.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our weighted average debt outstanding on our Owl Rock credit facility and prior revolving credit facility combined was $86.9 million. Our weighted average interest was 7.29% and 8.10% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In July 2018, proceeds from the Owl Rock credit facility were used to fully repay the outstanding balance of the prior revolving credit facility. In May 2019, a portion of the net proceeds received from the\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nNGLs. NGL pricing is generally tied to the price of oil, but varies based on differences in liquid components and location.\nIncome Taxes\nOperating Activity Update\nGathering, transportation and marketing expenses include the costs to process and transport our production to applicable sales points. Generally, the terms of the lease governing the development of our properties permits the operator to pass through these expenses to us by deducting a pro rata portion of such expenses from our production revenues.\nWe finance a portion of our working capital requirements and acquisitions with borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As a result, we incur interest expense that is affected by both fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions. We reflect interest paid to the lenders under our debt arrangements (currently, our revolving credit facility) in interest expense. In connection with the closing of our IPO, we fully repaid the outstanding borrowings under our Owl Rock credit facility. Please see Note 7-Long-Term Debt\u201d to the consolidated and combined financial statements of Brigham Minerals included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n\u2022On February 19, 2021, the Board of Directors of Brigham Minerals declared a dividend of $0.26 per share of Class A common stock payable on March 26, 2021 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 19, 2021.This brings the total capital returned to shareholders related to financial results from fiscal year 2020 to $1.01 per share.\nLocation differentials generally result from transportation costs based on the produced oil's proximity to consuming and refining markets and major trading points.\nOperating and other expenses\nWhen new wells are turned to sales, our collection of receivables has lagged approximately six months from initial production as operators complete the division order process, at which point we are paid in arrears and then kept current. Our cash and cash equivalents balance totaled $9.1 million and $51.1 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to acquisitions made and payment of dividends to our stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2020. See \"Note 4-Acquisitions and Divestitures\" to the consolidated and combined financial statements of Brigham Minerals included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion. We expect that our cash flows from operations and additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs. We expect that the pace of our operators' drilling and completion of our undeveloped locations, production volumes, commodity prices and differentials to WTI and Henry Hub prices for our oil, natural gas and NGL production will be the largest variables affecting our working capital.\nDD&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by 56%, or $17.3 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, which was primarily due to an increase in depletion expense of $17.0 million. Higher production volumes increased our depletion expense by $8.6 million, and a higher depletion rate increased our depletion expense by $8.4 million. The depletion rate was $13.63 per Boe and $11.22 per Boe for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in the depletion rate was a result of recent acquisition efforts focused on largely de-risked acreage with an increased likelihood of near-term production and development, as well as reclassification of proved undeveloped reserves to probable and possible reserves due to changes in assumptions of the development timing as a result of reduced activity by our operators. We adjust our depletion rates quarterly based upon the quarter-end internally generated reserve reports.\nSeverance and ad valorem taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by 81%, or $2.9 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, which was primarily due to higher severance taxes associated with oil revenue as a result of higher oil production volumes and higher oil prices, as well as higher ad valorem taxes in Texas.\nTemporary Equity\ncommitments under our revolving credit facility, provided that such acceleration and termination occurs automatically upon the occurrence of a bankruptcy or insolvency event of default.\nFactors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations to Our Historical Results of Operations\ntime, though in no case more than one year, such that we have not adjusted the expected amount of consideration for the effects of any significant financing component per the practical expedient in ASC 606.\nGathering, transportation, and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by 40%, or $2.0 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, which was largely driven by the 28% increase in our production volumes as well as an increase in gathering, transportation and marketing rates.\nUpon becoming a public company, we were required to comply with the SEC's rules implementing Section 302 and Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires our management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports, and, for the year ended December 31, 2020, provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, we will be required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 beginning with our first annual report subsequent to our ceasing to be an emerging growth company\u201d within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act.\nThe following table sets forth information with respect to cash dividends and distributions declared by our board of directors during 2020:\nNatural Gas. The NYMEX price quoted at Henry Hub is a widely used benchmark for the pricing of natural gas in the United States. The actual volumetric prices realized from the sale of natural gas differ from the quoted NYMEX price as a result of quality and location differentials.\nInterest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by 84%, or $4.7 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 due to lower average outstanding borrowings and lower average interest rates. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our weighted average debt outstanding on our revolving credit facility was $2.8 million compared to our weighted average debt outstanding on our Owl Rock credit facility and revolving credit facility combined of $55.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our weighted average interest was 1.91% and 7.29% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In May 2019, a portion of the net proceeds received from the IPO were used to fully repay the outstanding borrowings under the Owl Rock credit facility. In December 2019, a portion of the net proceeds received from the December 2019 Offering were used to fully repay the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. See table below and Note 7-Long-Term Debt\u201d and Note 1-Business and Basis of Presentation\u201d to the consolidated and combined financial statements of Brigham Minerals included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion of this transaction.\nA summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 is provided in the following table:\nNet cash used in investing activities\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. The forward-looking statements are dependent upon events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, market prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs, production volumes, estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves, mineral acquisition capital, economic and competitive conditions, regulatory changes and other uncertainties, as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d all of which are difficult to predict. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed may not occur. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements except as otherwise required by applicable law.\nThe chemical composition of crude oil plays an important role in its refining and subsequent sale as petroleum products. As a result, variations in chemical composition relative to the benchmark crude oil, usually WTI, will result in price adjustments, which are often referred to as quality differentials. The characteristics that most significantly affect quality differentials include the density of the oil, as characterized by its API gravity, and the presence and concentration of impurities, such as sulfur.\n\nOn December 16, 2019, Brigham Minerals completed an offering of 12,650,000 shares of its Class A common stock (the \"December 2019 Offering\"), including 6,000,000 shares issued and sold by Brigham Minerals and an aggregate of 6,650,000 shares sold by certain shareholders of the Company, of which 5,496,813 represents shares issued upon redemption of an equivalent number of their Brigham LLC units, at a price to the public of $18.10 per share.\nDD&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by 122%, or $17.0 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, which was primarily due to an increase in depletion expense of $17.1 million. Higher production volumes increased our depletion expense by $12.1 million, and a higher depletion rate increased our depletion expense by $5.0 million.\nInterest Expense\n(2) Does not include future unutilized fees, amortization of deferred financing costs, interest expense or other fees related to our revolving credit facility because we cannot determine with accuracy the timing of future loan advances, repayments or future interest rates to be charged.\n\u2022Our production volumes increased 28%, to 9,483 Boe/d (72% liquids, 53% oil), for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the prior year.\nOur consolidated and combined financial statements are based on a number of significant estimates including quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves that are the basis for the calculations of DD&A and impairment of oil and natural gas properties. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas and there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, reserve estimates may differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. Our reserve estimates are audited by CG&A, an independent petroleum engineering firm. Other items subject to significant estimates and assumptions include the carrying amount of oil and natural gas properties, valuation of derivative instruments and revenue accruals.\nTotal revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 increased by 51%, or $34.2 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was attributable to a $38.1 million increase in mineral and royalty revenues during the period, partially offset by a $3.9 million decrease in lease bonus revenue. The increase in mineral and royalty revenues was primarily the result of increased drilling and completion activity on our mineral and royalty interests, which resulted in a 91% increase in production volumes to 7,414 Boe/d and a corresponding increase in revenue of $54.4 million. Realized commodity prices decreased 14% resulting in an additional $16.3 million decrease in mineral and royalty revenues.\nIn connection with the previously mentioned COVID-19 pandemic and resulting market and commodity price challenges experienced during 2020, we saw reduced levels of potential acquisition opportunities, which could potentially delay our ability to execute on our growth strategy. With an improvement in commodity prices along with our financial strength, we are well positioned to capture attractive opportunities in 2021 that will generate shareholder value. Given that our capital allocation is within our control, we believe that the liquidity provided by our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will provide us with sufficient capital to execute our current strategy.\nOil and Gas Properties\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nOn July 27, 2018, we entered into a credit agreement with Owl Rock Capital Corporation, as administrative agent and collateral agent (our Owl Rock credit facility\u201d). Our Owl Rock credit facility was subject to customary fees, guarantees of subsidiaries, restrictions and covenants, including certain restricted payments, and was collateralized by certain of our royalty and mineral properties.\nSeverance and Ad Valorem Taxes\nRevenues\n\nOil revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by 74%, or $35.0 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Oil production volumes increased 95% to 4,151 barrels per day resulting in a $44.7 million increase in oil revenues. The increase in oil production volumes for the period was primarily attributable to increased drilling and completion activity on our properties in Texas, Oklahoma, North Dakota and New Mexico. Realized oil prices decreased 11% to $54.16 per barrel resulting in a decrease in revenue of $9.7 million.\nOperating and other expenses\nOperational Update\nNet cash (used in)/provided by financing activities\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily a result of dividends paid to holders of our Class A common stock of $42.2 million, distributions to holders of temporary equity of $24.7 million, the repurchase of shares of our Class A common stock from the September 2020 Selling Shareholders for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $3.5 million, and payment related to employee tax withholding for settlement of share-based compensation awards of $1.2 million. This was partially offset by borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $20.0 million.\nThe Company expects any near-term production growth will be driven by the continued conversion of its DUC and permit inventory. Brigham's DUC and permit inventory as of December 31, 2020 by basin is outlined in the table below:\n\nThe following table provides the components of our revenues and expenses for the periods indicated, as well as each period's respective average prices and production volumes:\nPrinciple Components of Our Cost Structure\nGathering, transportation and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by 26%, or $1.0 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, which was largely driven by the increase in our production volumes, partially offset by lower gathering, transportation and marketing rates.\nGeneral and administrative ( G&A\u201d) expenses are costs incurred for overhead, including payroll and benefits for our staff, share-based compensation expense, costs of maintaining our headquarters, costs of managing our properties, audit and other fees for professional services and legal compliance. As a result of becoming a public company, we incurred incremental G&A expenses including, but not limited to, costs associated with hiring new personnel, implementation of compensation programs that are competitive with our public company peer group including share-based compensation, annual and quarterly reports to stockholders, tax return preparation, independent and internal auditor fees, investor relations activities, registrar and transfer agent fees, incremental director and officer liability insurance costs and independent director compensation. These incremental G&A expenses are not reflected in our historical financial statements before the IPO date.\nThe table below summarizes the Company's mineral and royalty interest ownership as of the dates indicated and changes in such ownership on an annual basis.\nDUC and Permit Inventory\nUse of Estimates\n\nIn April 2019, Brigham Minerals completed the IPO of 16,675,000 shares of Class A common stock at a price to the public of $18.00 per share. As a result of the IPO, Brigham Minerals became a holding company whose sole material asset consisted of a 43.3% interest in Brigham LLC, which wholly owns Brigham Resources. Brigham Resources continues to wholly own the Minerals Subsidiaries, which own all of Brigham Resources' operating assets. In connection with the IPO, Brigham Minerals became the sole managing member of Brigham LLC and is responsible for all operational, management and administrative decisions relating to Brigham LLC's business and consolidates the financial results of Brigham LLC and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Brigham Resources.\nMarket Environment and COVID-19\nOil and natural gas sales\nDividends\nDUC Conversions\nSources of Our Revenues\nMineral and Royalty Interest Ownership Update\nUnder the full cost method of accounting, total capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated depletion and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount equal to the present value of future net revenues from proved reserves, discounted at 10% per annum (\"PV-10\"), plus the cost of unevaluated properties, less related income tax effects (full cost ceiling limitation). A write-down of the carrying value of the full cost pool (\"impairment charge\") is a noncash charge that reduces earnings and impacts equity in the period of occurrence and typically results in lower depletion expense in future periods. A ceiling limitation is calculated at each reporting period. The ceiling limitation calculation is prepared using an unweighted arithmetic average of oil prices (\"SEC oil price\") and natural gas prices (\"SEC gas price\") as of the first day of each month for the trailing 12-month period ended, as required under the guidelines established by the SEC. As of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the SEC oil prices were $39.57, $55.65, and $65.66, respectively, per barrel for oil, adjusted by area for energy content, transportation fees and regional price differentials, and the SEC gas prices were $2.00, $2.60, and $3.12, respectively, per MMBtu for natural gas, adjusted by area for energy content, transportation fees and regional price differentials. As a result of the decline in the SEC oil prices and the SEC gas prices during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, and taking into consideration certain reclassifications of proved undeveloped reserves to probable and possible reserves during the three months ended December 31, 2020, as a result of a slowdown in operator activity, the net book value of oil and natural gas properties exceeded the ceiling limitation, as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020, resulting in an impairment charge of $79.6 million to oil and gas properties, net during the year ended December 31, 2020. There were no impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nLease bonus revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased by 52%, or $3.9 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in leasing activity on our interests in Oklahoma, partially offset by an increase in leasing activity in Texas. Other revenues include payments for right-of-way and surface damages and were not a significant portion of the overall amount.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt. As a result of the full repayment of the outstanding balance of the Owl Rock credit facility of $200.0 million in May 2019, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $6.9 million. The loss on extinguishment of debt consisted of a $4.0 million write-off of capitalized debt issuance costs, a $2.1 million prepayment fee and legal fees of $0.8 million. See Note 7-Long-Term Debt\u201d to the consolidated and combined financial statements of Brigham Minerals, Inc. as of December 31, 2019 included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion of these transactions.\nWorking Capital\nA complete list of our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our audited consolidated and combined financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nSales and abandonments of oil and natural gas properties being amortized are accounted for as adjustments to the full cost pool, with no gain or loss recognized unless the adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves. A significant alteration would not ordinarily be expected to occur upon the sale of reserves involving less than 25% of the reserve quantities of a cost center.\nWe periodically assess whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets, including net operating losses. In making this determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions. We consider, among other things, our deferred tax liabilities, the overall business environment, our historical earnings and losses, current industry trends and our outlook for future years.\nDuring 2020 the Company saw 381 gross (2.6 net) wells spud on its acreage. 54% of gross (70% net) wells spud were in the Permian Basin, with 35% gross (60% net) wells spud in the Delaware Basin and 19% gross (10% net) wells spud in the Midland Basin:\n\u2022commodity prices; and\nIn 2019, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (\"ASC 606\") using the modified retrospective approach, which only applied to contracts that were in effect as of the date of adoption. The adoption did not require an adjustment to opening retained earnings for the cumulative effect adjustment and did not impact our previously reported results of operations, nor our ongoing consolidated and combined balance sheets, statements of cash flow or statements of changes in shareholders' and members' equity. Overall, there were no material changes in the timing of the satisfaction of our performance obligations or the allocation of the transaction price to our performance obligations in applying the guidance in ASC 606 as compared to legacy U.S. GAAP.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our net cash used in investing activities was primarily a result of acquisitions of mineral and royalty interests totaling $219.5 million and additions to other fixed assets of $0.4 million, offset by sales of mineral and royalty interests totaling $3.1 million.\nFuture declines in the unweighted arithmetic average SEC oil prices used in the full cost ceiling test may result in additional impairment charges in the future and such impairments could be material. In addition to the impact of lower prices, any future changes to assumptions of drilling and completion activity, development timing, acquisitions or divestitures of oil and gas properties, proved undeveloped locations, and production and other estimates may require revisions to estimates of total proved reserves which would impact the amount of any impairment charge.\nLease bonus and other income\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nNGL revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by 29%, or $1.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in NGL revenues was primarily attributable to the 67% increase in NGL volumes to 1,858 Boe/d resulting in a $4.1 million increase in NGL sales was primarily attributable to increased drilling and completion activities on our properties in the Permian Basin. This was partially offset by a 23% decrease in NGL prices to $11.61 per barrel resulting in a decrease in revenue of $2.3 million.\nIn order to track and assess the performance of our assets, we monitor and analyze our production volumes from the various resource plays that comprise our portfolio of mineral and royalty interests. We also regularly compare projected volumes to actual reported volumes and investigate unexpected variances.\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ex lease bonus.\nShare-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $10.0 million net of $3.8 million of share-based compensation cost capitalized to unevaluated property. At IPO, we recognized a cumulative effect adjustment of $2.0 million of share-based compensation cost related to the Incentive Units, pertaining to the period from the grant date through the IPO. Additionally, in April of 2019, in connection with the IPO, we adopted the Brigham Minerals, Inc. 2019 LTIP and granted restricted stock awards (\"RSAs\"), restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and performance-based vesting units (\"PSUs\") to our employees and executives. Certain of the RSAs vested immediately and we recognized $3.2 million of share-based compensation cost related to the RSAs. Also, subsequent to the IPO and prior to December 31, 2019, we recognized an additional $8.6 million of share-based compensation cost related to the Incentive Units and the awards granted under the LTIP. No share-based compensation expenses were recognized prior to the IPO because the IPO was not considered probable. See Note 10-Share-Based Compensation\u201d to the consolidated and combined financial statements of Brigham Minerals, Inc. as of December 31, 2019 included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion.\nIn 2020, the Company identified approximately 628 gross DUCs (4.7 net DUCs) converted to production, representing 70% of its gross DUC inventory (79% of its net DUCs) as of year-end 2019. 2020 conversions of gross wells by status are summarized in the graph below:\nshares of its Class A common stock in the September 2020 Secondary Offering and did not receive any proceeds pursuant to the September 2020 Secondary Offering. In addition, in connection with the September 2020 Secondary Offering, Brigham Minerals repurchased 436,630 shares of its Class A common stock from the September 2020 Selling Shareholders in a privately negotiated transaction at a price equal to the price per share at which the underwriter purchased shares from the September 2020 Selling Shareholders in the September 2020 Secondary Offering (and Brigham LLC redeemed a corresponding number of Brigham LLC Units held by Brigham Minerals). The repurchased shares are presented in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet as Treasury Stock, at cost.\nOur working capital, which we define as current assets minus current liabilities, totaled $22.6 million as of December 31, 2020, as compared to $71.6 million at December 31, 2019. Our collection of receivables has historically been timely, and losses associated with uncollectible receivables have historically not been significant.\n\nNatural gas, which currently has a limited global transportation system, is subject to price variances based on local supply and demand conditions and the cost to transport natural gas to end-user markets.\nIPO were used to fully repay the outstanding borrowings under the Owl Rock credit facility. In December 2019, a portion of the net proceeds received from the December 2019 Offering were used to fully repay the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. See Note 7-Long-Term Debt\u201d and Note 1-Business and Basis of Presentation\u201d to the consolidated and combined financial statements of Brigham Minerals, Inc. as of December 31, 2019 included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion of this transaction.\n\u2022As of December 31, 2020, Brigham Minerals had a cash balance of $9.1 million and $115.0 million of capacity on our revolving credit facility, providing the Company with total liquidity of $124.1 million.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nQuality differentials result from the heating value of natural gas measured in Btus and the presence of impurities, such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide and nitrogen. Natural gas containing ethane and heavier hydrocarbons has a higher Btu value and will realize a higher volumetric price than natural gas that is predominantly methane, which has a lower Btu value. Natural gas with a higher concentration of impurities will realize a lower volumetric price due to the presence of the impurities in the natural gas when sold or the cost of treating the natural gas to meet pipeline quality specifications.\nNet cash provided by operating activities is primarily affected by production volumes, the prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs, lease bonus revenue and changes in working capital. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 is primarily due to improved collections of receivables and reduced payments for interest and income taxes, partly offset by increased payments for operating expenses.\nOn September 15, 2020, Brigham Minerals completed an offering of 5,021,140 shares of its Class A common stock, including 654,931 shares issued pursuant to the option granted to the underwriter to purchase additional shares to cover over-allotments (the \"September 2020 Secondary Offering\"), all of which were sold by certain shareholders of the Company (the \"September 2020 Selling Shareholders\"), and 3,062,011 of which represented shares issued upon redemption of an equivalent number of the September 2020 Selling Shareholders' Brigham LLC Units (together with a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock in Brigham Minerals), at a price to the public of $8.20 per share. Brigham Minerals did not sell any\nRevenues\nNatural gas revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by 7%, or $0.7 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in natural gas revenues was primarily attributable to the 23% increase in natural gas production volume to 15,871 Mcf/d resulting in a $2.3 million increase in natural gas sales. The increase in natural gas production volumes for the period was primarily attributable to increased drilling and completion activity on our properties in the Permian Basin. This was partially offset by a 13% decrease in realized natural gas price to $1.80 per Mcf resulting in a decrease in revenue of $1.6 million.\nLease bonus revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by 51%, or $1.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in leasing activity on our interests in Texas, partially offset by a decrease in leasing activity in Colorado and Oklahoma. Other revenues include payments for right-of-way and surface damages and were not a significant portion of the overall amount.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 included $46.0 million in net capital contributions from the Original Owners and $213.4 million in additional borrowings under our prior revolving credit facility and the Owl Rock credit facility combined, net of $4.6 million in associated loan closing costs. This was partially offset by payment of $70.0 million to pay off and terminate the prior revolving credit facility on July 28, 2018 using funds from the new term loan facility.\nVolumes of Oil, Natural Gas and NGLs Produced\nInternal Controls and Procedures\nOur revolving credit facility allows us to hedge up to 85% of our reasonably anticipated projected production from our proved reserves of oil and natural gas, calculated separately, for up to 60 months in the future. We did not have any natural gas or oil derivative contracts in place as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded a loss on commodity derivative instruments, net of $0.6 million and a gain of $0.4 million, respectively. See Note 5-Derivative Instruments\u201d to the consolidated and combined financial statements of Brigham Minerals included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nIn determining the full cost ceiling impairment at December 31, 2020, we estimated the PV-10 of our total proved oil and natural gas reserves using the SEC oil price and the SEC gas price of $39.57 per Bbl and $2.00 per MMBtu, respectively, which is a decrease of 29% and 23%, respectively, from the December 31, 2019 SEC oil price and SEC gas price of $55.65 per Bbl and $2.60 per MMBtu, respectively. No impairment charge was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, our net cash used in investing activities was primarily a result of acquisitions of mineral and royalty interests totaling $195.6 million and additions to other fixed assets of $0.7 million. Our cash flows from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 also reflects $0.9 million of proceeds from the sale of equity securities.\nThe following table presents the breakdown of our revenues for the following periods:\nThe following table provides the components of our revenues and expenses for the periods indicated, as well as each period's respective average prices and production volumes:\n\u2022volumes of oil, natural gas and NGLs produced;\nNatural gas volumes are converted to Boe at the rate of six thousand Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of oil. This convention is not an equivalent price basis and there may be a large difference in value between an equivalent volume of oil versus an equivalent volume of natural gas.\n\nPrior to entering into our Owl Rock credit facility (which was terminated in May 2019), we maintained a revolving credit facility (our prior revolving credit facility\u201d) with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain lenders party thereto with commitments of $150.0 million (subject to a borrowing base). We repaid the $70.0 million outstanding balance under our prior revolving credit facility with proceeds from our Owl Rock credit facility and terminated the prior revolving credit facility. The borrowing base at the time of termination was $70.0 million.\nFurther declines in the SEC oil price or the SEC gas price could lead to additional impairment charges in the future and such impairment charges could be material. In addition to the impact of lower prices, any future changes to assumptions of drilling and completion activity, development timing, acquisitions or divestitures of oil and gas properties, proved undeveloped locations, and production and other estimates may require revisions to estimates of total proved reserves which would impact the amount of any impairment charge. Based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development activities, production data, economics and other factors, we may be required to write down the carrying value of our properties in future periods. The risk that we will be required to recognize impairments of our oil, natural gas and NGL properties increases during sustained periods of low commodity prices. In addition, impairments could occur if we were to experience sufficient downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or the present value of estimated future net revenues. If we incur impairment charges in the future, our results of operations for the periods in which such charges are taken may be materially and adversely affected.\nBrigham Minerals is subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes as a corporation. Texas imposes a franchise tax (commonly referred to as the Texas margin tax) at a rate of up to 1.00% on gross revenues less certain deductions, as specifically set forth in the Texas margin tax statute. A portion of our mineral and royalty interests are located in Texas basins. Our predecessor was treated as a flow-through entity, and is currently treated as a disregarded entity, for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, is generally not subject to U.S. federal income tax at the entity level.\nReceivables consist of mineral and royalty income due from operators for oil and gas sales to purchasers. Those purchasers remit payment for production to the operator of the properties and the operator, in turn, remits payment to us. Receivables from third parties for which we did not receive actual information, either due to timing delays or due to the unavailability of data at the time when revenues are recognized, are estimated. Volume estimates for wells with available historical actual data are based upon (i) the historical actual data for the months the data is available, or (ii) engineering estimates for the months the historical actual data is not available. We do not recognize revenues for wells with no historical actual data because we cannot conclude that it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in future periods. Pricing estimates are based upon actual prices realized in an area by adjusting the market price for the average basis differential from market on a basin-by-basin basis.\nAdjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ex lease bonus do not represent and should not be considered alternatives to, or more meaningful than, net income, income from operations, cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP as measures of our financial performance. Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ex lease bonus have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Our computation of Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ex lease bonus may differ from computations of similarly titled measures of other companies. For further discussion, please read Item 6 - Selected Financial Data-Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\nWe engage CG&A, our independent petroleum engineering firm, to audit our total estimated proved, probable and possible reserves. We expect proved, probable and possible reserve estimates will change as additional information becomes available and as commodity prices and costs change. We evaluate and estimate our proved, probable and possible reserves internally each quarter and CG&A audits our proved, probable and possible reserves annually. Reserve estimates are inherently imprecise. Accordingly, the estimates are expected to change as more current information becomes available. The estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves are based upon the use of technical and economic data including, but not limited to, well logs, geologic maps, seismic data, well test data, production data, historical price and cost information, historical and future operator development plans, and property ownership interests. Standard engineering and geoscience methods, such as reservoir modeling, performance analysis, volumetric analysis and analogy, which are considered to be appropriate and necessary to establish reserve quantities and reserve categorization that conform to SEC definitions and rules and regulations, are also used. As in all aspects of oil and natural gas evaluation, there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of engineering and geoscience data; therefore, these estimates necessarily represent only informed professional judgment.\n\u2022Our mineral and royalty revenues composed of crude oil, natural gas and NGL sales decreased 12%, to $86.2 million, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the prior year.\nAdjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ex lease bonus are non-GAAP supplemental financial measures used by our management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors, research analysts and others to assess the financial performance of our assets and their ability to sustain dividends over the long term without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt. As a result of the full repayment of the outstanding balance of the Owl Rock credit facility of $200.0 million in May 2019, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $6.9 million for the\nWe routinely review outstanding balances, assess the financial strength of our operators and record a reserve for amounts not expected to be fully recovered. We recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of $0.3 million, $0.6 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nAvailability under our revolving credit facility is governed by a borrowing base, which is subject to redetermination in May and November of each year. In addition, lenders holding two-thirds of the aggregate commitments may request one additional redetermination each year. Brigham Resources can also request one additional redetermination each year, and such other redeterminations as appropriate when significant acquisition opportunities arise. The borrowing base is subject to further adjustments for asset dispositions, material title deficiencies, certain terminations of hedge agreements and issuances of permitted additional indebtedness. Increases to the borrowing base require unanimous approval of the lenders, while decreases only require approval of lenders holding two-thirds of the aggregate commitments at such time. As of December 31, 2020, the borrowing base on our revolving credit facility was $135.0 million, with outstanding borrowings of $20.0 million, resulting in $115.0 million availability for future borrowings.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company completed 81 transactions acquiring 4,635 net royalty acres (standardized to a 1/8th royalty interest) for $66.5 million, in the Permian, SCOOP/STACK/Merge, Williston and DJ Basins. The Company deployed approximately 92% of its mineral acquisition capital in 2020 to the Permian Basin (70% Delaware and 22% Midland), 4% to the Anadarko Basin, 2% to the Williston Basin and 2% to the DJ Basin. The acquired minerals are expected to deliver near-term production and cash flow growth with the addition of 165 gross DUCs (0.6 net DUCs) and 97 gross permits (0.3 net permits) to our inventory counts. As of December 31, 2020, the Company owned roughly 86,285 net royalty acres, encompassing 13,496 gross (116.3 net) undeveloped horizontal locations, across 37 counties in what the Company views as the core of the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico, the SCOOP/STACK plays in the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma, the DJ Basin in Colorado and Wyoming and the Williston Basin in North Dakota.\nWe earn revenue from lease bonuses, delay rentals, and right-of-way payments. We generate lease bonus revenue by leasing our mineral interests to exploration and production companies. A lease agreement represents our contract with a customer and generally transfers the rights to any oil or natural gas discovered, grants us a right to a specified royalty interest, and requires that drilling and completion operations commence within a specified time period. We recognize lease bonus revenues when the lease agreement has been executed, payment has been received, and we have no further obligation to refund the payment. At the time we execute the lease agreement, we expect to receive the lease bonus payment within a reasonable\nNet cash provided by operating activities\nOwl Rock Credit Facility\nResults of Operations\n(1) As of December 31, 2020, the borrowing base on our revolving credit facility was $135.0 million, with outstanding borrowings of $20.0 million, resulting in $115.0 million availability for future borrowings.\n(1) Hedge prices reflect the effect of our commodity derivative transactions on our average sales prices. Our calculation of such effects include realized gains and losses on cash settlements for commodity derivatives, which we do not designate for hedge accounting.\nOverview\nIncome Tax Expense\n\u2022Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $58.0 million. Adjusted Net Income was $7.1 million, excluding an after-tax impairment to oil and gas properties of $65.1 million. Our net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was $21.6 million, while Adjusted Net Income was $27.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ex lease bonus decreased 17% to $65.0 million, and 20% to $59.6 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the prior year. Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ex lease bonus are non-GAAP financial measures. For a definition of Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ex lease bonus and a reconciliation to our most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, please read \"How We Evaluate Our Operations-Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Ex Lease Bonus.\"\nOur revenues are primarily derived from the mineral and royalty payments we receive from our operators based on the sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs produced from our properties, as well as from lease bonus payments. Mineral and royalty revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in volumes of production sold by our operators, production mix and commodity prices. Lease bonus revenues vary from period to period as a result of leasing activity on our mineral interests.\nIt is possible that, because of changes in market conditions or the inherent imprecision of reserve estimates, the estimates of future cash inflows, future gross revenue, the amount of oil and natural gas reserves, the remaining estimated lives of oil and natural gas properties or any combination of the above may be increased or reduced. Increases in recoverable economic volumes generally reduce per unit depletion rates while decreases in recoverable economic volumes generally increase per unit depletion rates.\nNatural gas revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by 39%, or $2.7 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Natural gas production volumes increased 88% to 12,896 Mcf/d resulting in a $6.1 million increase in natural gas sales. The increase in natural gas production volumes for the period was primarily attributable to increased drilling and completion activity on our properties in Oklahoma, Colorado, North Dakota, Texas and New Mexico. Realized natural gas prices decreased by 26% to $2.07 per Mcf resulting in a decrease in revenue of $3.4 million.\n(1) Hedged prices reflect the effect of our commodity derivative transactions on our average sales prices. Our calculation of such effects include realized gains and losses on cash settlements for commodity derivatives, which we do not designate for hedge accounting.\nOil revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by 17%, or $14.1 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in oil revenues was primarily attributable to the 31% decrease in realized oil price to $37.26 per barrel resulting in a decrease in revenue of $30.8 million. This was partially offset by a 20% increase in oil production volumes to 4,980 barrels per day resulting in a $16.7 million increase in oil revenues. The increase in oil production volumes for the period was primarily attributable to increased drilling and completion activity on our properties in the Permian Basin.\nSTACK plays in the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma, the DJ Basin in Colorado and Wyoming and the Williston Basin in North Dakota.\nThe prices we receive for oil, natural gas and NGLs vary by geographical area. The relative prices of these products are determined by factors affecting global and regional supply and demand dynamics, such as economic and geopolitical conditions, production levels, availability of transportation, weather cycles and other factors. In addition, realized prices are influenced by product quality and proximity to consuming and refining markets. Any differences between realized prices and NYMEX prices are referred to as differentials. All of our production is derived from properties located in the United States.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\n(1) Dividends paid to holders of Class A common stock.\nPrior to our IPO, our primary sources of liquidity were capital contributions from our Original Owners, borrowings under our debt arrangements and cash flows from operations. Subsequent to our IPO, our current primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and proceeds from any primary issuances of equity securities. Future sources of liquidity may also include other credit facilities we may enter into in the future and additional issuances of debt or equity securities. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the decline in commodities prices, coupled with many of our operators announcing significant reductions in projected capital expenditures in 2020 and beyond, our revenues and cash flows from operations have been and may continue to be negatively impacted and we may not have access to capital markets on terms favorable to us or at all.\nGathering, Transportation and Marketing Expenses\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, Brigham Minerals reduced its proved undeveloped reserves by 8,209 MBoe primarily due to a reclassification of 7,036 MBoe from proved undeveloped reserves to probable and possible reserves, as a result of decreased rig activity, a 29% reduction in SEC oil prices over the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, and conversion from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves. The reduction in rig activity led to changes in the development timing and a reduction of the number of proved undeveloped locations that Brigham Minerals expects will be developed within five years after the date of booking.\n\n\nShare-Based Compensation\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 included the combined net proceeds generated from the IPO and December 2019 Offering of $379.8 million offset by the combined full repayment of the outstanding balances of the Owl Rock credit facility and revolving credit facility of $175.0 million (net of additional borrowings of $105.0 million incurred during the year), dividends paid to holders of our Class A common stock of $14.7 million, distributions to holders of temporary equity of $20.1 million, payment of debt extinguishment fees of $2.1 million and payment of loan closing costs of $1.3 million.\nGeneral and administrative expense (before share-based compensation expense) for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by 79%, or $5.3 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Increases to G&A expense are a result of: (i) $0.7 million of incremental audit and tax fees, (ii) $0.7 million of additional salaries due to increase in headcount, (iii) $1.1 million of incremental D&O insurance expenses, (iv) $1.1 million of legal and professional fees and (v) $1.7 million of other incremental expenses as a result of becoming a publicly traded company.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the potential risk to our workforce and in compliance with stay at home orders, we successfully implemented policies and the technological infrastructure for all of our employees to work from home in the first quarter of 2020 and ceased all business travel. In compliance with the requirements for the re-opening of the Texas economy, we are currently operating our office at 75% capacity while continuing to support working from home for our employees that are considered high-risk pursuant to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines or have household members meeting the criteria of the guidelines. Due to these efforts, we have not experienced material disruptions to our operations or the health of our workforce.\nOn June 12, 2020, Brigham Minerals completed an offering of 6,600,000 shares of its Class A common stock (the \"June 2020 Secondary Offering\"), all of which were sold by certain shareholders of the Company (the June 2020 Selling Shareholders\u201d), and 4,872,669 of which represented shares issued upon redemption of an equivalent number of the June 2020 Selling Shareholders' Brigham LLC Units (together with a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock in Brigham Minerals), at a price to the public of $13.75 per share. Brigham Minerals did not sell any shares of its common stock in the June 2020 Secondary Offering and did not receive any proceeds pursuant to the June 2020 Secondary Offering.\nBrigham Minerals was formed to acquire and actively manage a portfolio of mineral and royalty interests in the core of what we view as the most active, highly economic, liquids-rich resource plays across the continental United States. Our primary business objective is to maximize risk-adjusted total return to our shareholders through (i) the growth of our free cash flow generated from our existing portfolio of approximately 86,285 net royalty acres, and (ii) the continued sourcing and execution of accretive mineral acquisitions in the core of highly economic, liquids-rich resource plays. As of December 31, 2020, we owned 86,285 net royalty acres across 37 counties within the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico, the SCOOP/\nCash Flows\n(1) Individual amounts may not total due to rounding.\nLoss on derivative instruments, net. Brigham Minerals did not have any derivative contracts in place as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Prior to December 31, 2019, we had certain oil swap contracts based on the NYMEX futures index. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized a loss on derivative instruments, net of $0.6 million, which is attributable to oil derivative instruments. We realized $0.5 million of gains on our settled derivative instruments during the year ended December 31, 2019. See Note 5-Derivative Instruments\u201d to the consolidated and combined financial statements of Brigham Minerals included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion of these transactions.\nThe ongoing global spread of a novel strain of coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2), which causes COVID-19, has caused a continuing disruption to the oil and natural gas industry and to our business by, among other things, contributing to a significant decrease in demand for crude oil and the price for oil beginning in the first quarter of 2020 and continuing through the fourth quarter of 2020. Additionally, in March 2020, Saudi Arabia and Russia failed to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls within OPEC and Russia. Subsequently, Saudi Arabia announced plans to increase production and reduce the prices at which they sell oil. While OPEC+ subsequently agreed to collectively decrease production, these events, combined with the macro-economic impact of the continued outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and declining availability of hydrocarbon storage, exacerbated the decline in commodity prices, including the historic, record low price of negative ($36.98) per barrel that occurred in April 2020. Additionally, in July 2020, OPEC+ agreed to begin easing production cuts starting in August 2020. Market volatility has continued, and we expect it will continue for the foreseeable future. Please see Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d for further discussion of these events.\nTotal revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by 10%, or $9.8 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was attributable to a $11.6 million decrease in mineral and royalty revenues during the period, partially offset by a $1.8 million increase in lease bonus revenue. The decrease in mineral and royalty revenues was primarily the result of a decrease in realized commodity prices of 31% resulting in a $39.3 million decrease in mineral and royalty revenues. This was partially offset by an increase in drilling and completion activity on our mineral and royalty interests, and to a lesser degree by acquisitions of proved developed producing reserves, which resulted in a 28% increase in production volumes to 9,483 Boe/d and a corresponding increase in mineral and royalty revenues of $27.7 million.\nWe define Adjusted Net Income as net income (loss) before impairment of oil and gas properties, after tax, and loss on extinguishment of debt, after tax. We define Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted Net Income before depreciation, depletion and amortization, share based compensation expense, interest expense, gain or loss on derivative instruments and income tax\nIncome Taxes\nThe following is a description of the principle components of our cost structure. However, as an owner of mineral and royalty interests, we are not obligated to fund drilling and completion capital expenditures to bring a horizontal well on line, lease operating expenses to produce our oil, natural gas and NGLs nor the plugging and abandonment costs at the end of a well's economic life. All the aforementioned costs are borne entirely by the exploration and production companies that have leased our mineral and royalty interests.\nG&A for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by 18%, or $2.2 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Increases to G&A expense are a result of: (i) $0.7 million in incremental legal, professional, audit, and tax fees as a result of the Company's June 2020 Secondary Offering and September 2020 Secondary Offering, (ii) $0.5 million in additional rent expense, (iii) $0.4 million of incremental directors and officers insurance expenses, and (iv) $0.3 million of additional salaries due to an increase in headcount.\nReceivables\nCorporate Reorganization and Transactions\nOil. The substantial majority of our oil production is sold at prevailing market prices, which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of our control. NYMEX light sweet crude oil, commonly referred to as WTI, is the prevailing domestic oil pricing index. The majority of our oil production is priced at the prevailing market price with the final realized price affected by both quality and location differentials.\nWe are an emerging growth company,\u201d under the JOBS Act, which allows us to take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act.\nGeneral and Administrative\n\u2022number of rigs on location, permits, spuds, completions and wells turned-in-line;\nThe corporate reorganization that was completed contemporaneously with the closing of the IPO provided a mechanism by which the Brigham LLC Units to be allocated amongst the Original Owners, including the holders of our management incentive units, was determined. As a result, the satisfaction of all conditions relating to the vesting of certain management incentive units held in Brigham Equity Holdings, LLC ( Brigham Equity Holdings\u201d) by our management and employees became probable. Accordingly, at IPO, we recognized a cumulative effect adjustment to share-based compensation cost of approximately $2.0 million pertaining to the period from the grant date through the IPO date, related to the estimated fair value of the Incentive Units (as defined in Note 10-Share-based Compensation-LLC Incentive Units\u201d to the consolidated and combined financial statements of Brigham Minerals included elsewhere in this Annual Report) at grant, all of which was non-cash.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Ex Lease Bonus\nSeverance taxes are paid on produced oil, natural gas or NGLs based on either a percentage of revenues from production sold or the number of units of production sold at fixed rates established by federal, state or local taxing authorities. In general, the production taxes we pay correlate to changes in our oil, natural gas and NGL revenues, which is driven by our production volumes and prices received for our oil, natural gas and NGLs. We are also subject to ad valorem taxes in some of the counties where our production is located. Ad valorem taxes are generally based on the state or local government's appraisal of the value of our oil, natural gas and NGL properties, which also trend with anticipated production, as well as oil, natural gas and NGL prices. Rates, methods of calculating property values and timing of payments vary across the different counties in which we own mineral and royalty interests.\nNet cash used in investing activities is primarily composed of acquisitions of mineral and royalty interests, net of dispositions. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our net cash used in investing activities was primarily a result of acquisitions of mineral and royalty interests totaling $66.5 million and other fixed assets totaling $0.5 million, offset by sales of mineral and royalty interests totaling $1.6 million.\nwe are able to pay our stockholders have continued to be negatively impacted. We cannot predict the extent and duration of these and other impacts on our business from the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts to fight the pandemic and other market events.\nAs a mineral and royalty interest owner, we incur the initial cost to acquire our interests, but thereafter do not incur any development capital expenditures or lease operating expenses, which are entirely borne by the operator. As a result, the vast majority of our capital expenditures are related to our acquisition of additional mineral and royalty interests. The amount and allocation of future acquisition-related capital expenditures will depend upon a number of factors, including the number and size of acquisition opportunities, our cash flows from operations, investing and financing activities and our ability to assimilate acquisitions. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we deployed approximately $72.7 million for acquisition-related capital expenditures, inclusive of a $6.1 million capitalized share-based compensation cost. We periodically assess changes in current and projected free cash flows, acquisition and divestiture activities, debt requirements and other factors to determine the effects\nFollowing the completion of the September 2020 Secondary Offering and as of December 31, 2020, Brigham Minerals owned a 76.8% interest in Brigham LLC and the Original Owners owned 23.2% of the outstanding voting stock of Brigham Minerals. Certain other entities affiliated with Yorktown Partners LLC and Pine Brook Road Advisors, LP, which are a subset of the Company's Original Owners, collectively owned 16.9% of the outstanding voting stock of Brigham Minerals as of December 31, 2020.\nCosts associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the amortizable cost base until a determination has been made as to the existence of proved reserves. Unevaluated properties are reviewed periodically to determine whether the costs incurred should be reclassified to the full cost pool and subjected to amortization. The costs associated with unevaluated properties primarily consist of acquisition and leasehold costs and capitalized interest. Unevaluated properties are assessed for impairment on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant. The assessment includes consideration of the following factors, among others: expectation of future drilling activity; past drilling results and activity; geological and geophysical evaluations; the assignment of proved reserves; and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned. During any period in which these factors indicate an impairment, the cumulative acquisition costs incurred to date for such property are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to amortization. There was no impairment recorded for unevaluated properties for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nexpense, less other income, gain on sale of oil and gas properties and income tax benefit. We define Adjusted EBITDA ex lease bonus as Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted to eliminate the impacts of lease bonus revenue we receive due to the unpredictability of timing and magnitude of the revenue.\nAnalysis of Cash Flow Changes Between the Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nFinancial and Operational Overview:\nBrigham Minerals accounts for the Original Owners' 23.2% interest in Brigham LLC (as of December 31, 2020) as temporary equity as a result of certain redemption rights held by the Original Owners as discussed in Note 9-Temporary Equity\u201d to the consolidated and combined financial statements of Brigham Minerals included elsewhere in this Annual Report. As such, Brigham Minerals adjusts temporary equity to its maximum redemption amount at the balance sheet date, if higher than the carrying amount. The redemption amount is based on the 10-day volume-weighted average closing price ( VWAP\u201d) of Class A shares at the end of the reporting period. Changes in the redemption value are recognized immediately as they occur, as if the end of the reporting period was also the redemption date for the instrument, with an offsetting entry to additional paid-in capital. Temporary equity is reclassified to permanent equity (i) upon Conversion of Class B common stock (and an equivalent number of Brigham LLC Units) to Class A common stock, or (ii) when holders of Class B common stock no longer control a majority of the votes of the board of directors through direct representation on the board of directors, and no longer control the determination of whether to make a cash payment upon a Brigham Unit Holder's exercise of its Redemption Right.\nUnder the full cost method of accounting, total capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated depletion and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount equal to the present value of future net revenues from proved reserves, discounted at 10% per annum (\"PV-10\"), plus the cost of unevaluated properties, less related income tax effects (full cost ceiling limitation). A write-down of the carrying value of the full cost pool (\"impairment charge\") is a noncash charge that reduces earnings and impacts equity in the period of occurrence and typically results in lower depletion expense in future periods. A ceiling limitation is calculated at each reporting period. The ceiling limitation calculation is prepared using the unweighted arithmetic average of oil price (\"SEC oil price\") and natural gas price (\"SEC gas price\") as of the first day of each month for the trailing 12-month period ended, as required under the guidelines established by the SEC. As of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the SEC oil prices were $39.57, $55.65, and $65.66, respectively, per barrel for oil, further adjusted by area for energy content, transportation fees and regional price differentials and the SEC gas prices were $2.00, $2.60, and $3.12, respectively, per MMBtu for natural gas, further adjusted by area for energy content, transportation fees and regional price differentials. As a result of the decline in the SEC oil prices and SEC gas prices during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, and taking into consideration certain reclassification of proved undeveloped reserves to probable and possible reserves during the three months ended December 31, 2020, as a result of a slowdown in operator activity, the net book value of oil and natural gas properties exceeded the ceiling limitation as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020, resulting in an impairment charge of $79.6 million to oil and gas properties, net during the year ended December 31, 2020. There were no impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nContractual Obligations\nWe may enter into certain derivative instruments to partially mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility on our cash flow generated from operations. From time to time, such instruments may include variable-to-fixed-price swaps, fixed-price contracts, costless collars and other contractual arrangements. The impact of these derivative instruments could affect the amount of cash flows we ultimately realize. Historically, we have only entered into minimal fixed-price swap contracts. Under fixed-price swap contracts, a counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price is less than the swap strike price. Conversely, we are required to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price is greater than the swap strike price. We may employ contractual arrangements other than fixed-price swap contracts in the future to mitigate the impact of price fluctuations. If commodity prices decline in the future, our hedging contracts may partially mitigate the effect of lower prices on our future revenue.\nOur primary uses of capital are for the payment of dividends to our stockholders and for investing in our business, specifically the acquisition of additional mineral and royalty interests. In connection with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the announced reductions in projected capital expenditures by our operators, our cash flows from operations have been and may continue to be negatively impacted, and as a result, the dividend amount we are able to pay our stockholders has been and may also continue to be negatively impacted.\nBrigham Minerals accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated by applying existing tax laws and the rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe decision to pay any future dividends is solely within the discretion of, and subject to approval by, our board of directors. Our board of directors' determination with respect to any such dividends, including the record date, the payment date and the actual amount of the dividend, will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors that the board deems relevant at the time of such determination. See \"Item 5 - Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities-Dividend Policy\" for further discussion of our dividend policy.\n*** A percentage calculation is not meaningful due to change in signs, zero-value denominator or a change greater than 300.\nAs of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020, the net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceeded the full cost ceiling limitation primarily due to the decline in oil and gas prices and reclassification of proved undeveloped reserves to probable and possible reserves during the three months ended December 31, 2020 as a result of a slowdown in operator activity. As a result, we recorded impairments of our oil and gas properties, net of $79.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization ( DD&A\u201d) is the systematic expensing of the capitalized costs incurred to acquire evaluated oil and natural gas properties. We use the full cost method of accounting, and, as such, all acquisition-related costs to acquire evaluated properties are capitalized and amortized in aggregate based on the estimated economic productive lives of our properties. Depletion is the expense recorded based on the cost basis of our properties and the volume of hydrocarbons extracted during each respective period, calculated on a units-of-production basis. Estimates of proved reserves are a major component of our calculation of depletion. We adjust our depletion rates quarterly based upon the quarter-end internally generated reserve reports unless circumstances indicate that there has been a significant change in reserves or costs. The year-end reserve reports are audited by CG&A.\nOur revolving credit facility matures on May 16, 2024. Loans drawn under our revolving credit facility may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty (other than customary LIBOR breakage) and must be prepaid in the event that exposure exceeds the lesser of the borrowing base and the elected availability at such time. The principal amount of loans that are prepaid are required to be accompanied by accrued and unpaid interest and fees on such amounts. Loans that are prepaid may be reborrowed. In addition, Brigham Resources may permanently reduce or terminate in full the commitments under our revolving credit facility prior to maturity. Any excess exposure resulting from such permanent reduction or termination must be prepaid. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our revolving credit facility, the administrative agent acting at the direction of the lenders holding a majority of the aggregate commitments at such time may accelerate outstanding loans and terminate all\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized a loss on derivative instruments, net of $0.6 million, which is attributable to oil derivative instruments. We realized $0.5 million of gains on our settled derivative instruments during the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized a net gain on derivative instruments of $0.4 million, which is attributable to derivative instruments based on the price of oil. We realized $0.8 million of losses on our settled derivative instruments during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOil, natural gas and NGLs sales revenues are generally recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer, the performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with customers are satisfied and collectability is reasonably assured. As a non-operator, we have limited visibility into the timing of when new wells start producing and production statements may not be received for 30 to 90 days or more after the date production is delivered. As a result, we are required to estimate the amount of production delivered to the purchaser and the price that we will receive for the sale of the product. The expected sales volumes and prices for these properties are estimated and recorded within the Accounts receivable line item in the accompanying consolidated and combined balance sheets. The difference between our estimates and the actual amounts received for oil and natural gas sales is recorded in the month that payment is received from the third party.\nItem 7.

from 2019 due to lower oil, gas and NGL prices, partially offset by higher production volumes.\n\n- Net loss for 2020 was $58.0 million compared to net income of $21.6 million in 2019, primarily due to a $79.6 million impairment charge on oil and gas properties resulting from lower SEC oil and gas prices. \n\n- Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was $65.0 million in 2020, down 17% from 2019. Adjusted EBITDA ex lease bonus fell 20% to $59.6 million. \n\n- Production volumes increased 28% to 9,483 Boe/d in 2020 compared to 2019, driven by increased drilling on mineral interests.\n\n- DD&A expense increased 56% to $48.2 million in 2020 compared to 2019 due to higher production volumes and a higher depletion rate.\n\n- G&A expenses increased 18% to $14.1 million in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher professional fees, rent, insurance costs and salaries.\n\n- Interest expense fell 84% to $0.9 million in 2020 as debt balances were much lower than 2019 after repaying the Owl Rock credit facility.\n\n- In 2020, $66.5 million was deployed to acquire mineral interests and $42.2 million was paid in dividends. Liquidity totaled $124.1 million at year-end.\n\nIn summary, financial results for 2020 were impacted by lower commodity prices but production growth continued. Impairment charges led to a net loss, but adjusted EBITDA was positive. Liquidity remains strong to fund operations and growth."}
