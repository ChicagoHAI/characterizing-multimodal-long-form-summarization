MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nValvoline is a worldwide marketer and supplier of engine and automotive maintenance products and services. Established in 1866, Valvoline's heritage spans over 150 years, during which it has developed powerful name recognition across multiple product and service channels. In addition to the iconic Valvoline-branded passenger car motor oils and other automotive lubricant products, Valvoline provides a wide array of lubricants used in heavy duty equipment, as well as automotive chemicals and fluids designed to improve engine performance and lifespan. Valvoline's premium branded product offerings enhance its high-quality reputation and provide customers with solutions that address a wide variety of needs.\nIn the United States and Canada, Valvoline's products and services are sold to retailers with over 50,000 retail outlets, to installer customers with over 15,000 locations, and through 1,385 franchised and company-owned stores. Valvoline also has a strong international presence with products sold in more than 140 countries. Valvoline serves its customer base through its sales force and technical support organization, allowing Valvoline to leverage its technology portfolio and customer relationships globally, while meeting customer demands locally. This combination of scale and strong local presence is critical to the Company's success.\nValvoline's fiscal year ends on September 30 of each year, and Valvoline has three reportable segments: Quick Lubes, Core North America, and International, with certain corporate and non-operational items included in Unallocated and Other to reconcile to consolidated results. Refer to Item 1 included in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of Valvoline's reportable segments.\nFISCAL 2019 OVERVIEW\nThe following were the significant events for fiscal 2019, each of which is discussed more fully in this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\n\u2022Quick Lubes growth in sales and earnings was driven by organic same-store sales growth and an overall increase in the number of stores expanding the Quick Lubes footprint in both the U.S. and Canada. For the year, system-wide same-store sales grew 10.1%, a record for full-year system-wide same-store sales growth, and represented the 13th consecutive year of same-store sales increases. This growth was driven by a balanced contribution from transaction growth and average ticket improvement due to effective marketing and customer retention, increased revenue from non-oil-change services, and favorable pricing and premium mix. The Quick Lubes system added 143 net new stores in fiscal 2019. Company-owned store growth was comprised of 28 newly-constructed stores and 29 acquired stores, which included the first company-owned stores outside the U.S. Strong franchise store growth of 86 stores included the Company's acquisition of Oil Changers franchised stores in Canada.\n\u2022Overall lower volume in Core North America led to declines in sales and earnings during fiscal 2019. This decline in volume was primarily due to a decrease in branded volume in the retail channel driven by the market challenges that have affected Core North America throughout the year. Installer customer channel volumes were lower primarily due to changes with certain key accounts, as the underlying base business remained steady. Also impacting Core North America's results were unfavorable costs related to the temporary shutdown of the Company's second largest domestic blending facility and the new revenue recognition guidance that resulted in a decline in the segment's operating income.\n\u2022International segment earnings increased modestly on roughly flat volume, with mixed results by region. The EMEA region showed strong volume growth during the year and provided benefits from the recent acquisition in Eastern Europe, which resulted in a bargain purchase gain. The Asia Pacific market had mixed results with improved volumes in many markets driven by channel development efforts that were more than offset by volume pressure in other markets, including China. The Latin American region had lower volumes from the prior year primarily related to the liquidation of the Company's subsidiary in Brazil completed in late fiscal 2018. Benefits from incentives received in fiscal 2019 for operating in a free-trade zone were more than offset by unfavorable currency movements and costs related to the temporary shutdown of the blending facility that also supports the International segment.\n\u2022On April 12, 2019, Valvoline amended its 2016 Credit Agreement to provide additional capacity under the revolving facility, lower interest rates, and extend the maturity to 2024. Proceeds from the amendment were used to pay down balances on the 2016 Term Loan, the 2016 Revolver, and the Trade Receivables Facility, and the remaining proceeds, including the undrawn amended revolving credit facility, are primarily expected to fund general corporate purposes and working capital needs.\n\u2022During fiscal 2019, Valvoline paid $80 million, $0.424 per common share, in cash dividends to its shareholders.\nBUSINESS STRATEGY\nValvoline's key business and growth strategies include:\n\u2022Aggressively growing Quick Lubes through organic service center expansion and opportunistic acquisitions, while enhancing retail service capabilities through a consistent and preferred customer experience delivered by hands-on experts;\n\u2022Strengthening and maintaining the foundation in Core North America by leveraging investments in technology and marketing to drive speed, efficiency and value across the business and customer interactions, while increasing penetration of Valvoline's full product portfolio;\n\u2022Accelerating International market share growth through continued development of and investment in key emerging and high value markets;\n\u2022Broadening capabilities to serve future transport vehicles by developing relationships with OEM and leveraging innovation in the development of future products and light services in direct and adjacent markets; and\n\u2022Accelerating the shift to a services-driven business by leveraging customer relationships and experiences to develop new capabilities globally.\nResults for Fiscal 2018 compared to Fiscal 2017\nFor comparisons of Valvoline's consolidated and segment results of operations and consolidated cash flows for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 to September 30, 2017, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, filed with the SEC on November 21, 2018.\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nTo aid in the understanding of Valvoline's ongoing business performance, certain items within this document are presented on an adjusted, non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP measures are not defined within U.S. GAAP and do not purport to be alternatives to net income/loss or cash flows from operating activities as measures of operating performance or cash flows. The following are the non-GAAP measures management has included and how management defines them:\n\u2022EBITDA, which management defines as net income/loss, plus income tax expense/benefit, net interest and other financing expenses, and depreciation and amortization;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA, which management defines as EBITDA adjusted for key items, as further described below, and net pension and other postretirement plan expense/income; and\n\u2022Free cash flow, which management defines as operating cash flows less capital expenditures and certain other adjustments as applicable.\nThese measures are not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and management believes the use of non-GAAP measures assists investors in understanding the ongoing operating performance of Valvoline's business by presenting comparable financial results between periods. The non-GAAP information provided is used by Valvoline's management and may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies, because of differing methods used by other companies in calculating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow provide a supplemental presentation of Valvoline's operating performance. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures, refer to the Results of Operations\u201d and Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d sections below.\nDue to depreciable assets associated with the nature of the Company's operations and interest costs related to Valvoline's capital structure, management believes EBITDA is an important supplemental measure to evaluate the Company's operating results between periods on a comparable basis.\nManagement also believes Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with a meaningful supplemental presentation of Valvoline's operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of the following:\n\u2022Key items - Key items consist of income or expenses associated with certain unusual, infrequent or non-operational income or expenses not directly attributable to the underlying business, which management believes impacts the comparability of operational results between periods. Key items may consist of adjustments related to: the impairment of an equity investment; legacy businesses, including the separation from Ashland and associated impacts of related indemnities; significant acquisitions or divestitures; restructuring-related matters; and other matters that are non-operational or unusual in nature. Key items are considered by management to be outside the comparable operational performance of the business and are also often related to legacy matters or market-driven events that are not directly related to the underlying business and do not have an immediate, corresponding impact on the Company's ongoing performance. Details with respect to the composition of key items recognized during the respective periods presented herein are set forth below in the EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\u201d section of Results of Operations\u201d that follows.\n\u2022Net pension and other postretirement plan expense/income - Net pension and other postretirement plan expense/income includes several elements impacted by changes in plan assets and obligations that are primarily driven by changes in the debt and equity markets, as well as those that are predominantly legacy in nature and related to prior service to the Company from employees (e.g., retirees, former employees, current employees with frozen benefits). These elements include (i) interest cost, (ii) expected return on plan assets, (iii) actuarial gains/losses, and (iv) amortization of prior service cost/credit. Significant factors that can contribute to changes in these elements include changes in discount rates used to remeasure pension and other postretirement obligations on an annual basis or upon a qualifying remeasurement, differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets, and other changes in actuarial assumptions, such as the life expectancy of plan participants. Accordingly, management considers that these elements are more reflective of changes in current conditions in global financial markets (in particular, interest rates) and are outside the operational performance of the business and are also primarily legacy amounts that are not directly related to the underlying business and do not have an immediate, corresponding impact on the compensation and benefits provided to eligible employees for current service. Adjusted EBITDA will continue to include pension and other postretirement service costs related to current employee service as well as the costs of other benefits provided to employees for current service.\nManagement uses free cash flow as an additional non-GAAP metric of cash flow generation. By including capital expenditures and certain other adjustments, as applicable, management is able to provide an indication of the ongoing cash being generated that is ultimately available for both debt and equity holders as well as other investment opportunities. Unlike cash flow from operating activities, free cash flow includes the impact of capital expenditures, providing a more complete picture of cash generation. Free cash flow has certain limitations, including that it does not reflect adjustments for certain non-discretionary cash flows, such as mandatory debt repayments. The amount of mandatory versus discretionary expenditures can vary significantly between periods.\nValvoline's results of operations are presented based on Valvoline's management structure and internal accounting practices. The structure and practices are specific to Valvoline; therefore, Valvoline's financial results, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other comparable companies. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow each have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income and cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because of these limitations, net income and cash flows from operating\nactivities should primarily be relied upon as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow should only be used as supplements. In evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow, one should be aware that in the future Valvoline may incur expenses/income similar to those for which adjustments are made in calculating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow. Valvoline's presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow should not be construed as a basis to infer that Valvoline's future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items.\nKey Business Measures\nValvoline tracks its operating performance and manages its business using certain key business measures, including system-wide and franchised same-store sales and lubricant volume from unconsolidated joint ventures, which management believes are important to understanding Valvoline's operating performance.\nSame-store sales is defined as sales by Quick Lubes service center stores (company-owned, franchised or the combination of both for system-wide same-store sales), with new stores excluded from the metric until the completion of their first full fiscal year in operation because this period is generally required for new store sales levels to normalize. Valvoline does not recognize sales from franchised stores as Quick Lubes operating segment revenue. Quick Lubes revenue is limited to sales at company-owned stores, sales of lubricants and other products to franchisees, and royalties and other fees from franchised stores. Although Valvoline does not record franchise sales as revenue in its Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, management believes system-wide and franchised same-store sales information is useful to assess the operating performance of an average Quick Lubes store.\nManagement uses lubricant volume from unconsolidated joint ventures to measure the operating performance of the International operating segment. Valvoline does not record lubricant sales from unconsolidated joint venture as International operating segment revenue. International revenue is limited to sales by consolidated affiliates. Although Valvoline does not record sales by unconsolidated joint ventures as revenue in its Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, management believes lubricant volume including and from unconsolidated joint ventures is useful to assess operating performance of investments in joint ventures.\nAccordingly, system-wide and franchised same store sales and lubricant volume, including unconsolidated joint ventures should be considered as supplements to, not substitutes for, Valvoline's sales, as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nConsolidated review\nThe following table summarizes the results of the Company's operations for the years ended September 30:\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,390 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,285 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>105 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>810 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>806 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>412 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>411 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>398 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>395 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>208 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>166 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the changes in sales from fiscal 2018 to 2019:\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pricing </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue recognition adjustments </td> <td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volume </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product mix </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Currency exchange </td> <td> </td> <td>(29) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>105 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nKey drivers of the increase in sales from the prior year were higher product pricing, favorable product mix, acquisitions, and the impact related to the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance, partially offset by unfavorable currency exchange. The effects of volume improvements in Quick Lubes more than offset declines in Core North America and International, favorably impacting sales during the period. During fiscal 2019, lubricant gallons sold decreased 2% to 178.4 million.\nThe changes to reportable segment sales and the drivers thereof are discussed in further detail in Reportable Segment Review\u201d below.\nGross profit\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the changes in gross profit from fiscal 2018 to 2019:\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volume and product mix </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue recognition adjustments </td> <td> </td> <td>(9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Currency exchange </td> <td> </td> <td>(7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Price and cost </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in gross profit was driven by favorable changes in volume and product mix, as well as the addition of acquired companies. The benefit of volume improvements in Quick Lubes and broad premium product mix increases more than offset the volume declines in Core North America and International, leading to a favorable combined volume and mix impact on gross profit. Offsetting these favorable impacts were decreases in gross profit related to the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance, currency exchange due to the strong U.S. dollar, and costs in excess of price, which\nincluded incremental costs related to the temporary shutdown of the Company's second largest domestic blending facility due to a fire at a nearby third-party petrochemical terminal.\nThe Valvoline blending facility in Texas that was temporarily shut down near the end of the second fiscal quarter of 2019, due to a nearby third-party fire and resulting chemical releases, sustained no damage, reopened and resumed operations in late April 2019. The Company quickly addressed the shutdown by utilizing its supply chain to shift production and minimize business impacts in order to fulfill customer orders timely. These actions resulted in incremental expenses of $6 million during fiscal 2019. Management is pursuing insurance recoveries related to the business interruption and does not expect to incur additional incremental costs beyond fiscal 2019.\nThe decrease in gross profit margin was largely due to certain reclassifications related to the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance and the incremental business interruption expenses related to the temporary shutdown of the blending facility.\nThe changes to reportable segment gross profit and the drivers thereof are discussed in further detail in Reportable Segment Review\u201d below.\nNet operating expenses\nThe table below provides details of the components of net operating expenses during the years ended September 30:\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Sales </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Sales </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>449 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>430 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net legacy and separation-related expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(11) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(78.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity and other income, net </td> <td> </td> <td>(40) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.7) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(33) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.4) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>412 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>411 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was largely driven by restructuring and related expenses of $14 million recognized during fiscal 2019, as well as increases related to acquisitions, marketing and advertising, and compensation-related costs compared to 2018. These increases were partially offset by the favorable impacts of currency exchange and certain reclassifications related to the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance in fiscal 2019.\nThe decrease in net legacy and separation-related expenses was largely related to the effects of the enactment of U.S. and Kentucky tax reform in fiscal 2018, which drove net increases to the estimated indemnities due to Ashland under the Tax Matters Agreement. Furthermore, the decrease is related to lower legacy multiemployer pension plan partial withdrawal assessment costs recognized in fiscal 2019.\nThe increase in equity and other income, net was primarily related to the bargain purchase gain recognized in connection with the acquisition of an Eastern European lubricant production company and incentives received for operating in a free-trade zone outside the U.S., partially offset by a decrease in other income related to a gain recognized in fiscal 2018 due to the sale of two Quick Lubes stores.\nNet pension and other postretirement plan expense\nNet pension and other postretirement plan expense increased $60 million from the prior year primarily due to a loss on pension and other postretirement plan remeasurement of $69 million compared to a loss of $38 million in fiscal 2018. This change was primarily attributed to decreases in discount rates, which was partially offset by higher than expected return on plan assets and favorable changes in mortality assumptions. In addition, pension de-risking actions taken by the Company to shift the U.S. qualified plan's target asset allocation toward more fixed income securities and better match the asset duration to that of the pension plan obligations resulted in a lower expected return on plan assets and a decrease in related recurring non-service income.\nNet interest and other financing expenses\nNet interest and other financing expense increased $10 million during fiscal 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was generally attributed to increased borrowing transactions during the current year, including the amendment of the 2016\nCredit Agreement, which resulted in additional expenses associated with executing the transaction and higher outstanding debt.\nIncome tax expense\nThe following summarizes income tax expense and the effective tax rate during the years ended September 30:\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>57 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>166 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate percentage </td> <td> </td> <td>21.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>50.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in income tax expense and the effective tax rate were principally driven by the prior year enactment of U.S. and Kentucky tax reform legislation, which resulted in the full year benefit of lower corporate statutory income tax rates in fiscal 2019 and reduced tax expense of approximately $78 million primarily related to the prior year remeasurement of net deferred tax assets at the lower corporate statutory income tax rates. In addition, benefits of approximately $10 million were recognized during fiscal 2019 related to accelerated deductions permitted by the provisions of U.S. tax reform, the expected utilization of tax attributes as a result of the clarification of certain provisions of Kentucky tax reform legislation, and the release of a valuation allowance.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nThe following table reconciles net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended September 30:\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>208 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>166 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense </td> <td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>166 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest and other financing expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>73 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA </td> <td> </td> <td>399 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>449 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net pension and other postretirement plan expense </td> <td> </td> <td>60 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net legacy and separation-related expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and related expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business interruption expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition and divestiture-related (gains) losses </td> <td> </td> <td>(4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>478 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>466 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)Net pension and other postretirement plan income includes remeasurement gains and losses and recurring non-service pension and other postretirement net periodic income, which consists of interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service credit. Refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nThe increase in Adjusted EBITDA of $12 million in fiscal 2019 was driven by the performance of the Quick Lubes reportable segment and its system-wide same-store sales growth from an increase in both transactions and average ticket. The strong performance of the Quick Lubes reportable segment more than offset Adjusted EBITDA declines in the Core North America reportable segment. The declines in Core North America were primarily a result of decreased volume, including challenges within the retail customer channel.\nReportable Segment Review\nValvoline's business is managed within the following three reportable segments:\n\u2022Quick Lubes - services the passenger car and light truck quick lube market through company-owned and independent franchised retail quick lube service center stores and independent Express Care stores that service vehicles with Valvoline products, as well as through investment in a joint venture in China to pilot expansion of retail quick lube service center stores outside of North America.\n\u2022Core North America - sells engine and automotive maintenance products in the United States and Canada to retailers, installers, and heavy-duty customers to service vehicles and equipment.\n\u2022International - sells engine and automotive products in more than 140 countries outside of the United States and Canada for the maintenance of consumer and commercial vehicles and equipment.\nValvoline's reportable segments are measured for profitability based on operating income; therefore, Valvoline does not generally allocate items to each reportable segment below operating income, such as net pension and other postretirement plan expense, net interest and other financing expenses or income tax expense. Operating income by segment includes the allocation of shared corporate costs, which are allocated consistently based on each segment's proportional contribution to various financial measures. Valvoline does not allocate certain significant corporate and non-operational matters, including, but not limited to, company-wide restructuring activities and costs or adjustments that relate to former businesses that Valvoline no longer operates. These matters are attributed to Unallocated and other. Results of Valvoline's reportable segments are presented based on how operations are managed internally, including how the results are reviewed by the chief operating decision maker. The structure and practices are specific to Valvoline; therefore, the financial results of its reportable segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other comparable companies.\nThe following table presents sales, operating income and statistical operating information by reportable segment for the years ended September 30:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>

Company-owned store growth was comprised of 28 newly-constructed stores and 29 acquired stores, which included the first company-owned stores outside the U.S. in Canada. Franchisee expansion into key markets continued and added 86 stores, including the Company's acquisition of Oil Changers franchised stores in Canada.\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the years ended September 30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same-store sales growth** - Company-owned\n</td> <td>9.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same-store sales growth** - Franchised* </td> <td>10.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same-store sales growth** - Combined* </td> <td>10.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Valvoline's franchisees are distinct legal entities and Valvoline does not consolidate the results of operations of its franchisees.\n** Valvoline determines same-store sales growth on a fiscal year basis, with new stores excluded from the metric until the completion of their first full fiscal year in operation.\nQuick Lubes sales increased $162 million, or 25%, during fiscal 2019. Volume growth in lubricant gallons and transactions driven by continued benefits from customer acquisition and retention programs increased sales by $66 million. The combination of executed pricing actions, increases in premium mix, and increases in non-oil-change services led to improved average ticket and increased sales by $40 million. The impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance increased sales by $36 million, and continued investments in acquisitions increased sales by $20 million.\nGross profit increased $56 million during fiscal 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to an increase in both transactions and average ticket. Increases in volumes and mix improvements combined to increase gross profit by $38 million. Acquisitions increased gross profit by $10 million, while implemented price increases improved gross profit by $5 million. Adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance increased gross profit by $3 million. Gross profit margin decreased\n1.0% primarily resulting from the reclassification of certain costs in connection with the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance and dilutive impacts of new store operations, partially offset by mix improvements.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses, which includes the allocation of shared costs, increased $29 million during fiscal 2019. These increases were primarily the result of higher allocation of shared costs and increased operating expenses, including costs associated with new store development teams, marketing and advertising.\nEquity and other income for the Quick Lubes segment declined in the current fiscal year as the prior fiscal year included a $3 million gain related to the sale of two service center stores.\nCore North America\nCore North America sales decreased $41 million, or 4%, to $994 million during fiscal 2019, which was driven largely by volume decreases of $54 million primarily due to reductions in branded volume in the retail channel. The shift of newly acquired Great Canadian Oil Change product sales to the Quick Lubes reportable segment also negatively impacted Core North America sales by $13 million. Partially offsetting these declines were favorable pricing and premium product mix of $14 million and an increase related to the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance of $14 million.\nGross profit decreased $43 million during fiscal 2019 compared to 2018. The adoption of new revenue recognition guidance resulted in certain reclassifications and impacted the timing of certain distributor sales, which decreased gross profit by $12 million. Volume declines, which included the shift of Great Canadian Oil Change to Quick Lubes, impacted gross profit by $27 million. Also negatively impacting gross profit were costs in excess of pricing of $7 million, which included $4 million related to the temporary shutdown of the Company's second largest domestic blending facility due to the fire at a nearby third-party petrochemical terminal. These declines were partially offset by $3 million of improvements related to increased premium product mix.\nGross profit margin decreased 2.9% compared to the prior year. This decline was primarily the result of incremental business interruption expenses related to the temporary shutdown of the blending facility, the impact related to the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance and the dilutive impact on margin rate of passing through cost increases.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses, which include the allocation of corporate costs, decreased $21 million during fiscal 2019 compared to 2018. This change is primarily attributable to the combination of lower allocated shared costs and reduced operating expenses of $13 million, as well as reclassifications related to the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance of $8 million.\nInternational\nInternational sales decreased $16 million, or 3%, in fiscal 2019. The decline in sales was largely attributable to unfavorable currency exchange of $28 million, partially offset by favorable pricing and product mix that contributed approximately $18 million to sales and increases related to the acquisition of an Eastern European lubricant production company. During fiscal 2019, volumes decreased 1% compared to the prior year and reduced sales by $8 million. Solid volume growth in certain Asia-Pacific markets and EMEA, which included the benefit of the acquisition in Eastern Europe, were offset by declines in other regions, primarily driven by a slower heavy-duty aftermarket in China.\nGross profit decreased by $9 million during fiscal 2019 compared to 2018. This decrease was primarily related to unfavorable currency exchange of $7 million and incremental costs of $2 million related to the temporary shutdown of the Company's second largest domestic blending facility due to the fire at a nearby third-party petrochemical terminal. Gross profit margin during fiscal 2019 decreased 0.8% primarily related to the incremental business interruption expenses related to the temporary shutdown of the blending facility and the dilutive impact on margin rate of passing through cost increases.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were flat during the year compared to the prior year. Higher operating expenses, including an increase in allocated indirect corporate costs, were offset by decreases in compensation-related costs and favorable currency exchange.\nEquity and other income increased by $9 million in fiscal 2019 primarily due to the $4 million bargain purchase gain resulting from the acquisition of the Eastern European lubricant production company and incentives received for operating in a free-trade zone. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable currency exchange.\nFINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nThe Company closely manages its liquidity and capital resources. Valvoline's liquidity requirements depend on key variables, including the level of investment needed to support business strategies, the performance of the business, capital expenditures, borrowing arrangements, and working capital management. Capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, and dividend payments are components of the Company's cash flow and capital management strategy, which to a large extent, can be adjusted in response to economic and other changes in the business environment. The Company has a disciplined approach to capital allocation, which focuses on investing in key priorities that support Valvoline's business and growth strategies and returning capital to shareholders, while funding ongoing operations.\nAs of September 30, 2019, the Company had $159 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, of which approximately $99 million was held by Valvoline's non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company utilizes a variety of strategies to deploy available cash in locations where it is needed. As a result of U.S. tax reform legislation, which provided the opportunity to mobilize cash with lower tax consequences, the Company does not indefinitely reinvest non-U.S. current and undistributed earnings. Withholding taxes are provided for within the income tax provision in the same period such earnings are generated. Certain other outside basis differences restricted by regulations, operational, or investing needs for non-U.S. subsidiaries remain indefinitely reinvested.\nCash flows\nValvoline's cash flows as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are summarized as follows for the years ended September 30:\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used in): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>325 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(188) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(213) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(71) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(209) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of currency exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash </td> <td> </td> <td>(3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>63 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(105) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating activities\nThe increase in cash flows provided by operating activities during fiscal 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to favorable working capital driven by the timing of payments partially offset by increased interest payments.\nInvesting activities\nThe decrease in cash flows used in investing activities for fiscal 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to lower cash consideration paid for acquisitions in the current year partially offset by increases in capital expenditures for company-owned quick lube new store openings and the Company's first blending and packaging plant in China. Lower proceeds related to the prior year sale of two Quick Lubes service center locations also contributed to the lower net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2019 compared to 2018.\nCapital expenditures are anticipated to increase to $160 million to $170 million in fiscal 2020 due to company store growth and investments related to the Company's first blending and packaging plant in China to meet the country's growing demand for premium lubricants and coolants. Capital expenditures related to this investment were approximately $18 million in fiscal 2019, and the Company expects an additional $40 million to $50 million in fiscal 2020.\nFinancing activities\nThe decrease in cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily driven by decreased share repurchase activity of $325 million and lower payments of $14 million related to the purchase of the remaining ownership interest in a consolidated subsidiary, which were partially offset by lower net proceeds from borrowings of $180 million and higher dividend payments of $22 million due to the increase in the quarterly dividend in fiscal 2019.\nFree cash flow and other liquidity information\nThe following table sets forth free cash flow for the disclosed periods and reconciles cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow. As previously noted, free cash flow has certain limitations, including that it does not reflect adjustments for certain non-discretionary cash flows, such as mandatory debt repayments. Refer to Use of Non-GAAP Measures\u201d within this Item 7 for additional information regarding this non-GAAP measure.\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the years ended September 30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows provided by operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>325 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Additions to property, plant and equipment </td> <td> </td> <td>(108) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(93) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>217 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>227 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt September 30, 2019, working capital (current assets minus current liabilities, excluding long-term debt due within one year) was $389 million compared to $344 million in 2018. Liquid assets (cash, cash equivalents, and accounts receivable) were 132% of current liabilities as of September 30, 2019 and 123% as of September 30, 2018. The increase in working capital is primarily related to higher cash and cash equivalents driven primarily by the timing of certain cash payments during the year, in addition to increased inventory.\nDebt\nOn April 12, 2019, Valvoline amended the 2016 Credit Agreement to extend the maturity to 2024, provide additional capacity under the revolving facility, and lower interest rates. The 2019 Term Loan proceeds of $575 million were used to pay the outstanding principal balance of the 2016 Term Loan of $255 million, the outstanding 2016 Revolver balance of $186 million, and $120 million on the Trade Receivables Facility, in addition to accrued and unpaid interest and fees, as well as expenses related to the amendment. Remaining proceeds from the amendment, including the 2019 Revolver capacity, are expected to fund general corporate purposes and working capital needs.\nAs of September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company had long-term debt (including the current portion and debt issuance costs and discounts) of $1.3 billion of loans and revolving facilities. Approximately 57% of Valvoline's outstanding borrowings as of September 30, 2019 had fixed rates, with the remainder bearing variable interest rates. As of September 30, 2019, Valvoline had $634 million of remaining borrowing capacity under its revolving facilities.\nRefer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details regarding the Company's debt instruments.\nContractual obligations and other commitments\nThe following table sets forth Valvoline's obligations and commitments to make future payments under existing contracts at September 30, 2019. Excluded from the table are contractual obligations for which the ultimate settlement of quantities or prices are not fixed and determinable.\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3\nyears </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5\nyears </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual obligations (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,351 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>835 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>400 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>115 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>267 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>120 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease and financing obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>84 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee benefit obligations (d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>111 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitments </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,127 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>143 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>648 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)Other long-term liabilities of approximately $130 million are excluded from this table as the uncertainty related to the amount and period of cash settlements prevents the Company from making a reasonably reliable estimate. These other long-term liabilities include the Company's net obligations to its former parent company, deferred compensation, unrecognized tax benefits, and self-insurance liabilities that primarily related to workers' compensation claims, among others.\n(b)Includes interest expense on both variable and fixed rate debt assuming no prepayments. Variable interest rates have been assumed to remain constant through the end of the term at the rates that existed as of September 30, 2019.\n(c)The operating lease obligations included on this table will be recorded on the balance sheet beginning in fiscal 2020 due to the Company's adoption of the new lease accounting guidance effective for the Company on October 1, 2019.\n(d)Includes estimated funding of pension plans for fiscal 2020, as well as projected benefit payments through fiscal 2029 for Valvoline's unfunded pension plans. Excludes benefit payments from pension plan trust funds.\nPension and other postretirement plan obligations\nDuring fiscal 2019, the Company made cash and non-cash contributions of approximately $14 million to its U.S. non-qualified and non-U.S. pension plans. Refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information relating to the Company's pension and other postretirement plans.\nDividend payments\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2019, the Company paid $80 million of cash dividends for $0.424 per common share. On November 14, 2019, the Board of Directors of Valvoline declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.113 per share of Valvoline common stock, which is payable on December 16, 2019 to shareholders of record on November 29, 2019. Future declarations of quarterly dividends are subject to approval by the Board of Directors and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change.\nRestructuring and related expenses\nIn the second fiscal quarter of 2019, the Company outlined a broad-based restructuring and cost-savings program that is expected to reduce costs, simplify processes and focus the organization's structure and resources on key growth initiatives. Valvoline's restructuring and cost-savings actions continue to progress, and Valvoline expects such actions will be largely implemented by the end of 2019. Part of this program includes employee separation actions, which are also expected to be generally completed by the end of 2019, with the associated termination benefits anticipated to be substantially paid by the end of 2020.\nAs a result of this restructuring program, Valvoline recognized $14 million of restructuring and related expenses during the year ended September 30, 2019. The Company expects that it will incur additional restructuring expenses of approximately $1 million during the first fiscal quarter of 2020. Restructuring expenses include employee severance and termination benefits that will be paid to employees pursuant to the restructuring program. Restructuring-related expenses consist of those costs which are beyond those normally included in restructuring and incremental to the Company's normal operating costs. These restructuring-related costs were expensed as incurred and primarily related to third-party professional service fees incurred in connection with execution of the restructuring program.\nRestructuring and related expenses were recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses within the Company's Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income as follows for the year ended September 30:\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring-related expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total restructuring and related expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults by segment do not include these restructuring and related expenses, which is consistent with the manner by which management assesses the performance and evaluates the results of each segment. Accordingly, these expenses were included in Unallocated and other.\nValvoline's restructuring actions remain on track and are expected to generate annualized pre-tax savings of approximately $40 million to $50 million with modest benefits realized in late fiscal 2019 and full savings expected to be delivered by the end of fiscal 2020. The ongoing annual savings are anticipated to benefit operating expenses, including Cost of sales and Selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, with a portion expected to be reinvested in the business to provide flexibility to address the ongoing market dynamics in Core North America and to invest in growth opportunities.\nRefer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details regarding this restructuring program.\nSummary\nAs of September 30, 2019, cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash totaled $159 million and total debt was $1.3 billion. Valvoline's ability to generate positive cash flows from operations is dependent on general economic conditions, the competitive environment in the industry, and is subject to the business and other risk factors described in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or otherwise comply with the terms of its credit facilities, Valvoline may be required to seek additional financing alternatives. The Company's total remaining borrowing capacity was $634 million as of September 30, 2019, and Valvoline was in compliance with all covenants of its debt obligations as of September 30, 2019.\nManagement believes that the Company has sufficient liquidity based on its current cash position, cash generated from business operations, and existing financing to meet its required pension and other postretirement plan contributions, debt servicing obligations, tax-related and other contractual commitments, and operating requirements for the next twelve months.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAs of September 30, 2019, Valvoline has no contractual obligations that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements that are not fully recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets or fully disclosed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As part of Valvoline's normal course of business, it is a party to certain financial guarantees and other commitments, and while these arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk that are not included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, such risk is not currently considered reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. The possibility that Valvoline would have to make actual cash expenditures in connection with these obligations is largely dependent on the performance of the party whose obligations Valvoline guarantees, or the occurrence of future events.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nFor a discussion and analysis of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements and the impact on Valvoline, refer to Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of Valvoline's consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and the disclosures of contingent matters. Significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, long-lived assets (including intangible assets and goodwill), customer incentives, employee benefit obligations and income taxes. Although management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nValuation of goodwill and other intangible assets\nGoodwill and other intangible assets are primarily established based on the allocation of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the acquisition date. Valvoline acquired 60 service center stores and a lubricant production company during fiscal 2019 for an aggregate purchase price of $78 million. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill or if the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceed the purchase price consideration, a bargain purchase gain is recorded. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, particularly with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flows, which includes consideration of future growth rates and margins, customer attrition rates, future changes in technology and brand awareness, and discount rates. Fair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. Identifiable intangible assets are primarily comprised of trademarks and trade names, reacquired franchise rights, and customer relationships.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is tested at the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter as of July 1 or more frequently if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. Judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include a decline in expected cash flows, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, a decision to sell a business, unanticipated competition, or slower growth rates, among others. Valvoline's reporting units are consistent with its reportable segments\nof Quick Lubes ($301 million in goodwill as of September 30, 2019), Core North America ($89 million in goodwill as of September 30, 2019), and International ($40 million in goodwill as of September 30, 2019).\nIn evaluating goodwill for impairment, Valvoline has the option to first perform a qualitative \"step zero\" assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary or to perform a quantitative \"step one\" assessment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. Under the qualitative assessment, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. Qualitative factors include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, and overall financial performance, among others. The consideration of these factors requires significant judgment and estimates and application of alternative assumptions could produce different results.\nUnder the step one assessment, if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the amount of the impairment loss, if any, must be measured under \"step two\" of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, an impairment loss will be recorded equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill over its implied fair value. Fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a weighted methodology considering the output from both the income and market approaches. The income approach incorporates the use of a discounted cash flow ( DCF\u201d) analysis. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the DCF model to forecast operating cash flows, including markets and market shares, sales volumes and prices, costs to produce, tax rates, capital spending, discount rate and working capital changes. Several of these assumptions vary among reporting units, and the cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved strategic operating plans. The market approach is performed using the Guideline Public Companies method which is based on earnings multiple data. The Company also performs a reconciliation between market capitalization and the estimate of the aggregate fair value of the reporting units, including consideration of a control premium.\nAlthough no qualitative factors were present that indicated the existence of a potential impairment, Valvoline elected to perform a quantitative assessment during fiscal 2019 and determined that each reporting unit had a fair value that exceeded its carrying value by 130% and more. In fiscal 2018 and 2017, Valvoline performed qualitative assessments and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of Valvoline's reporting units were in excess of carrying amounts.\nValvoline's goodwill impairment assessment could change in future periods if any or all of the following events were to occur with respect to a particular reporting unit: a significant change in projected business results, a divestiture decision, significant changes to certain cash flow assumptions, economic deterioration that is more severe or of a longer duration than anticipated, or other significant economic events.\nOther intangible assets\nTotal other intangible assets were $74 million, net of $18 million of accumulated amortization as of September 30, 2019. Other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Various factors are considered in determining whether a trigger requiring impairment assessment has occurred, such as changes in the expected use of the assets, changes in technology or development of alternative assets, changes in economic conditions, changes in operating performance and changes in expected future cash flows.\nIf a trigger requiring impairment assessment occurred and the future undiscounted cash flows result in a value that is less than the carrying value, the intangible asset is considered impaired and a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value. Fair value is determined based on the highest and best use of the assets considered from the perspective of market participants, which may be different than the Company's actual intended use of the assets. Judgment is involved in identifying impairment triggering events, determining asset groups, future undiscounted cash flows and the fair value of asset groups.\nThere were no significant impairments recognized by the Company during fiscal 2019, 2018 or 2017.\nCustomer incentives\nValvoline records revenue for the amount that reflects the consideration the Company is expected to be entitled to based on when control of the promised good or service is transferred to the customer. The nature of Valvoline's contracts with customers often give rise to variable consideration that generally decrease the transaction price and consist primarily of promotional rebates and customer pricing discounts based on achieving certain levels of sales activity. Variable consideration is recorded as a reduction of the transaction price at the time of sale and is primarily estimated utilizing the most likely amount method that is expected to be earned as the Company is able to estimate the anticipated discounts\nwithin a sufficiently narrow range of possible outcomes based on its extensive historical experience with certain customers, similar programs and management's judgment with respect to estimating customer participation and performance levels. Variable consideration is reassessed at each reporting date and adjustments are made, when necessary. The cost of these programs recognized as a reduction of sales totaled $346 million, $357 million and $360 million in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. A 10% change in the reserves for customer incentive programs as of September 30, 2019 would have affected net earnings by approximately $7 million in fiscal 2019.\nEmployee benefit obligations\nValvoline sponsors defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the U.S and in certain countries outside the U.S. The majority of these plans were transferred to and assumed by the Company in the Contribution of certain of Ashland's pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets in late fiscal 2016. As of September 30, 2019, Valvoline's net unfunded pension and other postretirement plan liabilities included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet totaled $399 million, and the U.S. plans represented 95% of this total obligation. Total pension and other postretirement net periodic benefit costs included in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the year ended September 30, 2019 were:\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service costs </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-service pension and other postretirement net periodic income (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on pension and other postretirement plans remeasurement (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>69 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total pension and other postretirement net periodic benefit costs </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)Non-service pension and other postretirement net periodic income includes the expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service credit, net of interest costs.\n(b)Losses on pension and other postretirement plans remeasurement include the change in the actual return on plan assets and net actuarial losses upon remeasurement as of September 30, 2019.\nValvoline recognizes the change in the fair value of plan assets and the net actuarial gains and losses calculated using updated actuarial assumptions as of the measurement date, which for Valvoline is September 30, and when a plan qualifies for an interim remeasurement. The remaining components of pension and other postretirement benefits income are recorded ratably on a quarterly basis. Due to the freeze of U.S. pension benefits effective September 30, 2016, continuing service costs are limited to certain international pension plans, and are reported in the same caption of the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income as the related employee payroll expenses. All components of net periodic benefit income other than service cost are recognized below operating income within Net pension and other postretirement plan expense in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The loss on pension and other postretirement plans remeasurement of $69 million in fiscal 2019 was primarily attributed to decreases in discount rates, partially offset by higher than expected returns on plan assets and favorable changes in mortality assumptions.\nActuarial assumptions\nThe Company's pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on actuarial valuations and various assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liabilities relating to these plans. These assumptions include estimates and judgments the Company makes about interest rates, expected long-term investment return on plan assets, rate of increase in healthcare costs, rates of future compensation increases and mortality. Though management considers current market conditions and other relevant factors in establishing these assumptions, the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, longer or shorter life spans of participants, and differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets. These differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension or other postretirement benefits cost recorded or that may be recorded.\nChanges in assumptions or asset values may have a significant effect on the measurement of expense or income. Significant assumptions the Company must review and set annually and at each measurement date related to its pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are:\n\u2022Expected long-term return on plan assets - Based on long-term historical actual asset return information, the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and future estimates of long-term investment returns. The Company also deducts various expenses using the fair value of plan assets to estimate expense. The weighted-average long-term expected rate of return on assets assumption was 4.66% for fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2019, the global pension plan assets generated an actual weighted-average return of 15.7%, primarily driven by the market performance of U.S. plan assets based on the Company's investment strategy to hedge plan assets with the movement in liabilities related to changes in the interest rates. However, the expected return on plan assets is designed to be a long-term assumption, and therefore, actual returns will be subject to year-to-year variances. The U.S. pension plans comprise the most significant portion of plan assets, and for fiscal 2020, the expected rate of return on assets assumption for the U.S. pension plans will be 4.70%. The expected long-term return on plan assets assumption has no impact on the reported net liability or net actuarial gains or losses upon remeasurement, but does impact the recognition of recurring non-service net periodic income recorded ratably on a quarterly basis.\nValvoline's pension plans hold a variety of investments designed to diversify risk. Plan assets are invested in equity securities, government and agency securities, corporate debt, and other non-traditional assets such as hedge funds. The investment goal of the pension plans is to achieve an adequate net investment return to provide for future benefit payments to its participants. U.S. target asset allocation percentages as of September 30, 2019 were 25% equity and 75% fixed income investments. The U.S. pension plans are managed by professional investment managers that operate under investment management contracts that include specific investment guidelines, requiring among other actions, adequate diversification and prudent use of risk management practices such as portfolio constraints relating to established benchmarks. Valvoline's investment strategy and management practices relative to plan assets of non-U.S. plans generally are consistent except in those countries where investment of plan assets is dictated by applicable regulations.\n\u2022Discount rate - Reflects the rates at which benefits could effectively be settled and is based on current investment yields of high-quality corporate bonds. Consistent with historical practice, the Company uses an actuarially-developed full yield curve approach, the above mean yield curve, to match the timing of cash flows of expected future benefit payments from the plans by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve to determine the assumed discount rate. Valvoline's fiscal 2019 expense, excluding actuarial gains and losses, for both U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans was determined using the spot discount rate as of the beginning of the fiscal year. The service cost and interest cost discount rates for fiscal 2019 pension expense were 2.92% and 4.00%, respectively, and 3.98% and 3.83%, respectively, for other postretirement expense. The weighted-average discount rate at the end of fiscal 2019 was 3.10% for the pension plans and 2.95% for the postretirement health and life plans.\n\u2022Mortality - Based on the Society of Actuaries PRI-2012 mortality base tables and a mortality improvement scale that follows the 2019 Trustees Report of the Social Security Administration Intermediate Alternative as reflected in the MSS-2019 improvement scale. Valvoline believes the updated mortality improvement scales provide a reasonable assessment of current mortality trends and is an appropriate estimate of future mortality projections.\n\u2022Rate of compensation increase - This assumption is no longer applicable to the U.S. pension plans due to the benefit accrual freeze as of September 30, 2016. In addition, some of the non-U.S. pension plans are also frozen, while those that remain open relate to areas where local laws require plans to operate within the applicable country. The weighted-average rate of compensation increase assumption for these non-U.S. plans was 3.06% for fiscal 2019.\n\u2022Healthcare cost trend rate - Because Valvoline's retiree healthcare plans contain various caps that limit Valvoline's contributions and as medical inflation is expected to continue at a rate in excess of these caps, the healthcare cost trend rate has not had a significant impact on Valvoline's postretirement healthcare benefit costs.\nThe following table illustrates the estimated increases in hypothetical pension and other postretirement expense that would have resulted from a one percentage point change in isolation of any other impacts in each of the following significant assumptions in the years ended September 30:\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in pension expense from: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in the discount rate </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>268 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>237 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in the salary adjustment rate </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in other postretirement expense from: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in the discount rate </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe U.S. qualified pension plan comprises a substantial portion of Valvoline's total employee benefit plan obligation, and the investing strategy for its plan assets is targeted to hedge approximately 90% of the movement in liabilities related to changes in interest rates.\nIncome taxes\nValvoline is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous international jurisdictions. Judgment in forecasting taxable income using historical and projected future operating results is required in determining Valvoline's provision for income taxes and the related assets and liabilities. Each increase of $3 million to income tax expense would impact the fiscal 2019 effective tax rate by one percentage point.\nThe provision for income taxes includes current income taxes as well as deferred income taxes. Under U.S. GAAP, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the deferred assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized. The effect of changes in tax rates on deferred taxes is recognized in the period in which such changes are enacted.\nValuation allowances are established when necessary on a jurisdictional basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence, which includes historical profitability, future market growth, future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. The Company assesses deferred taxes and the adequacy or need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. As of September 30, 2019, the Company had $180 million of deferred tax assets, including $2 million in valuation allowances. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient future taxable income, there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates, the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, or if the tax laws change unfavorably, then Valvoline could be required to increase the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, resulting in an increase in income tax expense and the effective tax rate.\nAs a result of the separation from Ashland, Valvoline agreed to indemnify Ashland for certain income tax matters. As of September 30, 2019, Valvoline's liability for these estimated indemnification obligations is $66 million. Valvoline generally records a liability when it is probable and reasonably estimable that indemnification will be due to Ashland and makes adjustments through earnings in the period that changes are known. Certain of these estimates require management to forecast its use of tax attributes generated in the pre-Distribution periods, as well as to evaluate the likelihood and potential magnitude of tax positions taken in consolidated Ashland returns in the periods prior to Distribution expected to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities.\nThe Company is subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions, including those in the pre-Distribution periods. At any time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities and a number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which a liability has been established, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. In evaluating the exposures associated with various tax filing positions, including its indemnification obligations to Ashland, the Company may record liabilities for such exposures. The Company's liabilities for these matters are currently largely recorded within its indemnification obligation to Ashland. Valvoline generally adjusts its liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related indemnification obligations through earnings in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. Although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and may materially increase or decrease the effective tax rate, as well as impact the Company's operating results.", "item_7_truncated": "\u2022International - sells engine and automotive products in more than 140 countries outside of the United States and Canada for the maintenance of consumer and commercial vehicles and equipment.\n1.0% primarily resulting from the reclassification of certain costs in connection with the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance and dilutive impacts of new store operations, partially offset by mix improvements.\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>208 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>166 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense </td> <td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>166 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest and other financing expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>73 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA </td> <td> </td> <td>399 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>449 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net pension and other postretirement plan expense </td> <td> </td> <td>60 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net legacy and separation-related expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and related expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business interruption expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition and divestiture-related (gains) losses </td> <td> </td> <td>(4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>478 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>466 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGoodwill is tested at the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter as of July 1 or more frequently if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired.

Variable interest rates have been assumed to remain constant through the end of the term at the rates that existed as of September 30, 2019.\nValvoline recognizes the change in the fair value of plan assets and the net actuarial gains and losses calculated using updated actuarial assumptions as of the measurement date, which for Valvoline is September 30, and when a plan qualifies for an interim remeasurement. The remaining components of pension and other postretirement benefits income are recorded ratably on a quarterly basis. Due to the freeze of U.S. pension benefits effective September 30, 2016, continuing service costs are limited to certain international pension plans, and are reported in the same caption of the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income as the related employee payroll expenses. All components of net periodic benefit income other than service cost are recognized below operating income within Net pension and other postretirement plan expense in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The loss on pension and other postretirement plans remeasurement of $69 million in fiscal 2019 was primarily attributed to decreases in discount rates, partially offset by higher than expected returns on plan assets and favorable changes in mortality assumptions.\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the years ended September 30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same-store sales growth** - Company-owned\n</td> <td>9.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same-store sales growth** - Franchised* </td> <td>10.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same-store sales growth** - Combined* </td> <td>10.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in cash flows used in investing activities for fiscal 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to lower cash consideration paid for acquisitions in the current year partially offset by increases in capital expenditures for company-owned quick lube new store openings and the Company's first blending and packaging plant in China.

Consistent with historical practice, the Company uses an actuarially-developed full yield curve approach, the above mean yield curve, to match the timing of cash flows of expected future benefit payments from the plans by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve to determine the assumed discount rate. Valvoline's fiscal 2019 expense, excluding actuarial gains and losses, for both U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans was determined using the spot discount rate as of the beginning of the fiscal year. The service cost and interest cost discount rates for fiscal 2019 pension expense were 2.92% and 4.00%, respectively, and 3.98% and 3.83%, respectively, for other postretirement expense. The weighted-average discount rate at the end of fiscal 2019 was 3.10% for the pension plans and 2.95% for the postretirement health and life plans.\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service costs </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-service pension and other postretirement net periodic income (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on pension and other postretirement plans remeasurement (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>69 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total pension and other postretirement net periodic benefit costs </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDividend payments\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used in): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>325 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(188) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(213) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(71) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(209) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of currency exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash </td> <td> </td> <td>(3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>63 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(105) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet operating expenses\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in pension expense from: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in the discount rate </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>268 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>237 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in the salary adjustment rate </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in other postretirement expense from: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in the discount rate </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnder the step one assessment, if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the amount of the impairment loss, if any, must be measured under \"step two\" of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, an impairment loss will be recorded equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill over its implied fair value. Fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a weighted methodology considering the output from both the income and market approaches. The income approach incorporates the use of a discounted cash flow ( DCF\u201d) analysis. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the DCF model to forecast operating cash flows, including markets and market shares, sales volumes and prices, costs to produce, tax rates, capital spending, discount rate and working capital changes. Several of these assumptions vary among reporting units, and the cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved strategic operating plans. The market approach is performed using the Guideline Public Companies method which is based on earnings multiple data. The Company also performs a reconciliation between market capitalization and the estimate of the aggregate fair value of the reporting units, including consideration of a control premium.\nThe increase in equity and other income, net was primarily related to the bargain purchase gain recognized in connection with the acquisition of an Eastern European lubricant production company and

financial statements that are not fully recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets or fully disclosed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As part of Valvoline's normal course of business, it is a party to certain financial guarantees and other commitments, and while these arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk that are not included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, such risk is not currently considered reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. The possibility that Valvoline would have to make actual cash expenditures in connection with these obligations is largely dependent on the performance of the party whose obligations Valvoline guarantees, or the occurrence of future events.\nManagement believes that the Company has sufficient liquidity based on its current cash position, cash generated from business operations, and existing financing to meet its required pension and other postretirement plan contributions, debt servicing obligations, tax-related and other contractual commitments, and operating requirements for the next twelve months.\nThe U.S. qualified pension plan comprises a substantial portion of Valvoline's total employee benefit plan obligation, and the investing strategy for its plan assets is targeted to hedge approximately 90% of the movement in liabilities related to changes in interest rates.\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pricing </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue recognition adjustments </td> <td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volume </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product mix </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Currency exchange </td> <td> </td> <td>(29) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>105 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTo aid in the understanding of Valvoline's ongoing business performance, certain items within this document are presented on an adjusted, non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP measures are not defined within U.S. GAAP and do not purport to be alternatives to net income/loss or cash flows from operating activities as measures of operating performance or cash flows. The following are the non-GAAP measures management has included and how management defines them:\nPension and other postretirement plan obligations\nManagement uses free cash flow as an additional non-GAAP metric of cash flow generation. By including capital expenditures and certain other adjustments, as applicable, management is able to provide an indication of the ongoing cash being generated that is ultimately available for both debt and equity holders as well as other investment opportunities. Unlike cash flow from operating activities, free cash flow includes the impact of capital expenditures, providing a more complete picture of cash generation. Free cash flow has certain limitations, including that it does not reflect adjustments for certain non-discretionary cash flows, such as mandatory debt repayments. The amount of mandatory versus discretionary expenditures can vary significantly between periods.\nAs of September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company had long-term debt (including the current portion and debt issuance costs and discounts) of $1.3 billion of loans and revolving facilities. Approximately 57% of Valvoline's outstanding borrowings as of September 30, 2019 had fixed rates, with the remainder bearing variable interest rates. As of September 30, 2019, Valvoline had $634 million of remaining borrowing capacity under its revolving facilities.\nReportable Segment Review\nThe decrease in gross profit margin was largely due to certain reclassifications related to the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance and the incremental business interruption expenses related to the temporary shutdown of the blending facility.\nValvoline's results of operations are presented based on Valvoline's management structure and internal accounting practices. The structure and practices are specific to Valvoline; therefore, Valvoline's financial results, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other comparable companies. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow each have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income and cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because of these limitations, net income and cash flows from operating\nValvoline tracks its operating performance and manages its business using certain key business measures, including system-wide and franchised same-store sales and lubricant volume from unconsolidated joint ventures, which management believes are important to understanding Valvoline's operating performance.\nThe Company is subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions, including those in the pre-Distribution periods. At any time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities and a number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which a liability has been established, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. In evaluating the exposures associated with various tax filing positions, including its indemnification obligations to Ashland, the Company may record liabilities for such exposures. The Company's liabilities for these matters are currently largely recorded within its indemnification obligation to Ashland. Valvoline generally adjusts its liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related indemnification obligations through earnings in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. Although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and may materially increase or decrease the effective tax rate, as well as impact the Company's operating results.\nInternational\nSelling, general and administrative expenses, which includes the allocation of shared costs, increased $29 million during fiscal 2019. These increases were primarily the result of higher allocation of shared costs and increased operating expenses, including costs associated with new store development teams, marketing and advertising.\nAs of September 30, 2019, the Company had $159 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, of which approximately $99 million was held by Valvoline's non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company utilizes a variety of strategies to deploy available cash in locations where it is needed. As a result of U.S. tax reform legislation, which provided the opportunity to mobilize cash with lower tax consequences, the Company does not indefinitely reinvest non-U.S. current and undistributed earnings. Withholding taxes are provided for within the income tax provision in the same period such earnings are generated. Certain other outside basis differences restricted by regulations, operational, or investing needs for non-U.S. subsidiaries remain indefinitely reinvested.\nEquity and other income increased by $9 million in fiscal 2019 primarily due to the $4 million bargain purchase gain resulting from the acquisition of the Eastern European lubricant production company and incentives received for operating in a free-trade zone. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable currency exchange.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses, which include the allocation of corporate costs, decreased $21 million during fiscal 2019 compared to 2018. This change is primarily attributable to the combination of lower allocated shared costs and reduced operating expenses of $13 million, as well as reclassifications related to the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance of $8 million.\nThe changes to reportable segment gross profit and the drivers thereof are discussed in further detail in Reportable Segment Review\u201d below.\nAs a result of the separation from Ashland, Valvoline agreed to indemnify Ashland for certain income tax matters. As of September 30, 2019, Valvoline's liability for these estimated indemnification obligations is $66 million. Valvoline generally records a liability when it is probable and reasonably estimable that indemnification will be due to Ashland and makes adjustments through earnings in the period that changes are known. Certain of these estimates require management to forecast its use of tax attributes generated in the pre-Distribution periods, as well as to evaluate the likelihood and potential magnitude of tax positions taken in consolidated Ashland returns in the periods prior to Distribution expected to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets are primarily established based on the allocation of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the acquisition date. Valvoline acquired 60 service center stores and a lubricant production company during fiscal 2019 for an aggregate purchase price of $78 million. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill or if the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceed the purchase price consideration, a bargain purchase gain is recorded. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, particularly with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flows, which includes consideration of future growth rates and margins, customer attrition rates, future changes in technology and brand awareness, and discount rates. Fair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. Identifiable intangible assets are primarily comprised of trademarks and trade names, reacquired franchise rights, and customer relationships.\nEmployee benefit obligations\nThe table below provides details of the components of net operating expenses during the years ended September 30:\nValvoline records revenue for the amount that reflects the consideration the Company is expected to be entitled to based on when control of the promised good or service is transferred to the customer. The nature of Valvoline's contracts with customers often give rise to variable consideration that generally decrease the transaction price and consist primarily of promotional rebates and customer pricing discounts based on achieving certain levels of sales activity. Variable consideration is recorded as a reduction of the transaction price at the time of sale and is primarily estimated utilizing the most likely amount method that is expected to be earned as the Company is able to estimate the anticipated discounts\nincluded incremental costs related to the temporary shutdown of the Company's second largest domestic blending facility due to a fire at a nearby third-party petrochemical terminal.\n(a)Non-service pension and other postretirement net periodic income includes the expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service credit, net of interest costs.\n(c)The operating lease obligations included on this table will be recorded on the balance sheet beginning in fiscal 2020 due to the Company's adoption of the new lease accounting guidance effective for the Company on October 1, 2019.\nFINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCash flows\nQuick Lubes sales are influenced by the number of service center stores and the business performance of those stores. The following tables provide supplemental information regarding company-owned and franchised stores that Valvoline believes is relevant to an understanding of the Quick Lubes business and its performance.\n\u2022Aggressively growing Quick Lubes through organic service center expansion and opportunistic acquisitions, while enhancing retail service capabilities through a consistent and preferred customer experience delivered by hands-on experts;\nThe following table sets forth free cash flow for the disclosed periods and reconciles cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow. As previously noted, free cash flow has certain limitations, including that it does not reflect adjustments for certain non-discretionary cash flows, such as mandatory debt repayments. Refer to Use of Non-GAAP Measures\u201d within this Item 7 for additional information regarding this non-GAAP measure.\n\u2022On April 12, 2019, Valvoline amended its 2016 Credit Agreement to provide additional capacity under the revolving facility, lower interest rates, and extend the maturity to 2024. Proceeds from the amendment were used to pay down balances on the 2016 Term Loan, the 2016 Revolver, and the Trade Receivables Facility, and the remaining proceeds, including the undrawn amended revolving credit facility, are primarily expected to fund general corporate purposes and working capital needs.\nGoodwill\nCredit Agreement, which resulted in additional expenses associated with executing the transaction and higher outstanding debt.\n\nThe Valvoline blending facility in Texas that was temporarily shut down near the end of the second fiscal quarter of 2019, due to a nearby third-party fire and resulting chemical releases, sustained no damage, reopened and resumed operations in late April 2019. The Company quickly addressed the shutdown by utilizing its supply chain to shift production and minimize business impacts in order to fulfill customer orders timely. These actions resulted in incremental expenses of $6 million during fiscal 2019. Management is pursuing insurance recoveries related to the business interruption and does not expect to incur additional incremental costs beyond fiscal 2019.\nValvoline is a worldwide marketer and supplier of engine and automotive maintenance products and services. Established in 1866, Valvoline's heritage spans over 150 years, during which it has developed powerful name recognition across multiple product and service channels. In addition to the iconic Valvoline-branded passenger car motor oils and other automotive lubricant products, Valvoline provides a wide array of lubricants used in heavy duty equipment, as well as automotive chemicals and fluids designed to improve engine performance and lifespan. Valvoline's premium branded product offerings enhance its high-quality reputation and provide customers with solutions that address a wide variety of needs.\n(b)Excludes volumes from unconsolidated subsidiaries.\nThere were no significant impairments recognized by the Company during fiscal 2019, 2018 or 2017.\nThe following were the significant events for fiscal 2019, each of which is discussed more fully in this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(d)Includes estimated funding of pension plans for fiscal 2020, as well as projected benefit payments through fiscal 2029 for Valvoline's unfunded pension plans. Excludes benefit payments from pension plan trust funds.\nThe decrease in net legacy and separation-related expenses was largely related to the effects of the enactment of U.S. and Kentucky tax reform in fiscal 2018, which drove net increases to the estimated indemnities due to Ashland under the Tax Matters Agreement. Furthermore, the decrease is related to lower legacy multiemployer pension plan partial withdrawal assessment costs recognized in fiscal 2019.\n\u2022During fiscal 2019, Valvoline paid $80 million, $0.424 per common share, in cash dividends to its shareholders.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2019, the Company paid $80 million of cash dividends for $0.424 per common share. On November 14, 2019, the Board of Directors of Valvoline declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.113 per share of Valvoline common stock, which is payable on December 16, 2019 to shareholders of record on November 29, 2019. Future declarations of quarterly dividends are subject to approval by the Board of Directors and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change.\nAlthough no qualitative factors were present that indicated the existence of a potential impairment, Valvoline elected to perform a quantitative assessment during fiscal 2019 and determined that each reporting unit had a fair value that exceeded its carrying value by 130% and more. In fiscal 2018 and 2017, Valvoline performed qualitative assessments and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of Valvoline's reporting units were in excess of carrying amounts.\nGross profit\nFISCAL 2019 OVERVIEW\nFor a discussion and analysis of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements and the impact on Valvoline, refer to Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn evaluating goodwill for impairment, Valvoline has the option to first perform a qualitative \"step zero\" assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary or to perform a quantitative \"step one\" assessment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. Under the qualitative assessment, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. Qualitative factors include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, and overall financial performance, among others. The consideration of these factors requires significant judgment and estimates and application of alternative assumptions could produce different results.\nDuring fiscal 2019, the Company made cash and non-cash contributions of approximately $14 million to its U.S. non-qualified and non-U.S. pension plans. Refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information relating to the Company's pension and other postretirement plans.\nThe changes to reportable segment sales and the drivers thereof are discussed in further detail in Reportable Segment Review\u201d below.\nThe Quick Lubes system added 143 net new stores in fiscal 2019. Company-owned store growth was comprised of 28 newly-constructed stores and 29 acquired stores, which included the first company-owned stores outside the U.S. in Canada. Franchisee expansion into key markets continued and added 86 stores, including the Company's acquisition of Oil Changers franchised stores in Canada.\nValvoline's cash flows as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are summarized as follows for the years ended September 30:\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nof Quick Lubes ($301 million in goodwill as of September 30, 2019), Core North America ($89 million in goodwill as of September 30, 2019), and International ($40 million in goodwill as of September 30, 2019).\nNet interest and other financing expenses\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\n(b)Losses on pension and other postretirement plans remeasurement include the change in the actual return on plan assets and net actuarial losses upon remeasurement as of September 30, 2019.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nManagement also believes Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with a meaningful supplemental presentation of Valvoline's operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of the following:\nGross profit increased $56 million during fiscal 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to an increase in both transactions and average ticket. Increases in volumes and mix improvements combined to increase gross profit by $38 million. Acquisitions increased gross profit by $10 million, while implemented price increases improved gross profit by $5 million. Adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance increased gross profit by $3 million. Gross profit margin decreased\nFree cash flow and other liquidity information\nAs a result of this restructuring program, Valvoline recognized $14 million of restructuring and related expenses during the year ended September 30, 2019. The Company expects that it will incur additional restructuring expenses of approximately $1 million during the first fiscal quarter of 2020. Restructuring expenses include employee severance and termination benefits that will be paid to employees pursuant to the restructuring program. Restructuring-related expenses consist of those costs which are beyond those normally included in restructuring and incremental to the Company's normal operating costs. These restructuring-related costs were expensed as incurred and primarily related to third-party professional service fees incurred in connection with execution of the restructuring program.\nThe increase in cash flows provided by operating activities during fiscal 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to favorable working capital driven by the timing of payments partially offset by increased interest payments.\n\nDue to depreciable assets associated with the nature of the Company's operations and interest costs related to Valvoline's capital structure, management believes EBITDA is an important supplemental measure to evaluate the Company's operating results between periods on a comparable basis.\nGross profit decreased $43 million during fiscal 2019 compared to 2018. The adoption of new revenue recognition guidance resulted in certain reclassifications and impacted the timing of certain distributor sales, which decreased gross profit by $12 million. Volume declines, which included the shift of Great Canadian Oil Change to Quick Lubes, impacted gross profit by $27 million. Also negatively impacting gross profit were costs in excess of pricing of $7 million, which included $4 million related to the temporary shutdown of the Company's second largest domestic blending facility due to the fire at a nearby third-party petrochemical terminal. These declines were partially offset by $3 million of improvements related to increased premium product mix.\nResults for Fiscal 2018 compared to Fiscal 2017\nRefer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details regarding this restructuring program.\nGross profit margin decreased 2.9% compared to the prior year. This decline was primarily the result of incremental business interruption expenses related to the temporary shutdown of the blending facility, the impact related to the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance and the dilutive impact on margin rate of passing through cost increases.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCapital expenditures are anticipated to increase to $160 million to $170 million in fiscal 2020 due to company store growth and investments related to the Company's first blending and packaging plant in China to meet the country's growing demand for premium lubricants and coolants. Capital expenditures related to this investment were approximately $18 million in fiscal 2019, and the Company expects an additional $40 million to $50 million in fiscal 2020.\n\nEquity and other income for the Quick Lubes segment declined in the current fiscal year as the prior fiscal year included a $3 million gain related to the sale of two service center stores.\nCore North America sales decreased $41 million, or 4%, to $994 million during fiscal 2019, which was driven largely by volume decreases of $54 million primarily due to reductions in branded volume in the retail channel. The shift of newly acquired Great Canadian Oil Change product sales to the Quick Lubes reportable segment also negatively impacted Core North America sales by $13 million. Partially offsetting these declines were favorable pricing and premium product mix of $14 million and an increase related to the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance of $14 million.\nValuation allowances are established when necessary on a jurisdictional basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence, which includes historical profitability, future market growth, future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. The Company assesses deferred taxes and the adequacy or need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. As of September 30, 2019, the Company had $180 million of deferred tax assets, including $2 million in valuation allowances. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient future taxable income, there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates, the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, or if the tax laws change unfavorably, then Valvoline could be required to increase the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, resulting in an increase in income tax expense and the effective tax rate.\n\u2022Net pension and other postretirement plan expense/income - Net pension and other postretirement plan expense/income includes several elements impacted by changes in plan assets and obligations that are primarily driven by changes in the debt and equity markets, as well as those that are predominantly legacy in nature and related to prior service to the Company from employees (e.g., retirees, former employees, current employees with frozen benefits). These elements include (i) interest cost, (ii) expected return on plan assets, (iii) actuarial gains/losses, and (iv) amortization of prior service cost/credit. Significant factors that can contribute to changes in these elements include changes in discount rates used to remeasure pension and other postretirement obligations on an annual basis or upon a qualifying remeasurement, differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets, and other changes in actuarial assumptions, such as the life expectancy of plan participants. Accordingly, management considers that these elements are more reflective of changes in current conditions in global financial markets (in particular, interest rates) and are outside the operational performance of the business and are also primarily legacy amounts that are not directly related to the underlying business and do not have an immediate, corresponding impact on the compensation and benefits provided to eligible employees for current service. Adjusted EBITDA will continue to include pension and other postretirement service costs related to current employee service as well as the costs of other benefits provided to employees for current service.\nTotal other intangible assets were $74 million, net of $18 million of accumulated amortization as of September 30, 2019. Other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Various factors are considered in determining whether a trigger requiring impairment assessment has occurred, such as changes in the expected use of the assets, changes in technology or development of alternative assets, changes in economic conditions, changes in operating performance and changes in expected future cash flows.\nThe preparation of Valvoline's consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and the disclosures of contingent matters. Significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, long-lived assets (including intangible assets and goodwill), customer incentives, employee benefit obligations and income taxes. Although management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nRefer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details regarding the Company's debt instruments.\nRestructuring and related expenses\n\u2022Accelerating International market share growth through continued development of and investment in key emerging and high value markets;\n** Valvoline determines same-store sales growth on a fiscal year basis, with new stores excluded from the metric until the completion of their first full fiscal year in operation.\nResults by segment do not include these restructuring and related expenses, which is consistent with the manner by which management assesses the performance and evaluates the results of each segment. Accordingly, these expenses were included in Unallocated and other.\nDebt\n\u2022Strengthening and maintaining the foundation in Core North America by leveraging investments in technology and marketing to drive speed, efficiency and value across the business and customer interactions, while increasing penetration of Valvoline's full product portfolio;\n\nAccordingly, system-wide and franchised same store sales and lubricant volume, including unconsolidated joint ventures should be considered as supplements to, not substitutes for, Valvoline's sales, as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n(a)Other long-term liabilities of approximately $130 million are excluded from this table as the uncertainty related to the amount and period of cash settlements prevents the Company from making a reasonably reliable estimate. These other long-term liabilities include the Company's net obligations to its former parent company, deferred compensation, unrecognized tax benefits, and self-insurance liabilities that primarily related to workers' compensation claims, among others.\nValvoline's key business and growth strategies include:\nValvoline's reportable segments are measured for profitability based on operating income; therefore, Valvoline does not generally allocate items to each reportable segment below operating income, such as net pension and other postretirement plan expense, net interest and other financing expenses or income tax expense. Operating income by segment includes the allocation of shared corporate costs, which are allocated consistently based on each segment's proportional contribution to various financial measures. Valvoline does not allocate certain significant corporate and non-operational matters, including, but not limited to, company-wide restructuring activities and costs or adjustments that relate to former businesses that Valvoline no longer operates. These matters are attributed to Unallocated and other. Results of Valvoline's reportable segments are presented based on how operations are managed internally, including how the results are reviewed by the chief operating decision maker. The structure and practices are specific to Valvoline; therefore, the financial results of its reportable segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other comparable companies.\n\nThe following table sets forth Valvoline's obligations and commitments to make future payments under existing contracts at September 30, 2019. Excluded from the table are contractual obligations for which the ultimate settlement of quantities or prices are not fixed and determinable.\nKey drivers of the increase in sales from the prior year were higher product pricing, favorable product mix, acquisitions, and the impact related to the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance, partially offset by unfavorable currency exchange. The effects of volume improvements in Quick Lubes more than offset declines in Core North America and International, favorably impacting sales during the period. During fiscal 2019, lubricant gallons sold decreased 2% to 178.4 million.\n\n\u2022Core North America - sells engine and automotive maintenance products in the United States and Canada to retailers, installers, and heavy-duty customers to service vehicles and equipment.\nRestructuring and related expenses were recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses within the Company's Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income as follows for the year ended September 30:\nAs of September 30, 2019, cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash totaled $159 million and total debt was $1.3 billion. Valvoline's ability to generate positive cash flows from operations is dependent on general economic conditions, the competitive environment in the industry, and is subject to the business and other risk factors described in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or otherwise comply with the terms of its credit facilities, Valvoline may be required to seek additional financing alternatives. The Company's total remaining borrowing capacity was $634 million as of September 30, 2019, and Valvoline was in compliance with all covenants of its debt obligations as of September 30, 2019.\nCustomer incentives\nValvoline's fiscal year ends on September 30 of each year, and Valvoline has three reportable segments: Quick Lubes, Core North America, and International, with certain corporate and non-operational items included in Unallocated and Other to reconcile to consolidated results. Refer to Item 1 included in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of Valvoline's reportable segments.\nThe following table summarizes the results of the Company's operations for the years ended September 30:\n\u2022Free cash flow, which management defines as operating cash flows less capital expenditures and certain other adjustments as applicable.\n\nGross profit decreased by $9 million during fiscal 2019 compared to 2018. This decrease was primarily related to unfavorable currency exchange of $7 million and incremental costs of $2 million related to the temporary shutdown of the Company's second largest domestic blending facility due to the fire at a nearby third-party petrochemical terminal. Gross profit margin during fiscal 2019 decreased 0.8% primarily related to the incremental business interruption expenses related to the temporary shutdown of the blending facility and the dilutive impact on margin rate of passing through cost increases.\nCore North America\nOn April 12, 2019, Valvoline amended the 2016 Credit Agreement to extend the maturity to 2024, provide additional capacity under the revolving facility, and lower interest rates. The 2019 Term Loan proceeds of $575 million were used to pay the outstanding principal balance of the 2016 Term Loan of $255 million, the outstanding 2016 Revolver balance of $186 million, and $120 million on the Trade Receivables Facility, in addition to accrued and unpaid interest and fees, as well as expenses related to the amendment. Remaining proceeds from the amendment, including the 2019 Revolver capacity, are expected to fund general corporate purposes and working capital needs.\nIncome tax expense\nThe following table reconciles net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended September 30:\nThe Company's pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on actuarial valuations and various assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liabilities relating to these plans. These assumptions include estimates and judgments the Company makes about interest rates, expected long-term investment return on plan assets, rate of increase in healthcare costs, rates of future compensation increases and mortality. Though management considers current market conditions and other relevant factors in establishing these assumptions, the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, longer or shorter life spans of participants, and differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets. These differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension or other postretirement benefits cost recorded or that may be recorded.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the changes in sales from fiscal 2018 to 2019:\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the changes in gross profit from fiscal 2018 to 2019:\n(a)Gross profit as a percent of sales is defined as sales, less cost of sales, divided by sales.\n\n\u2022Quick Lubes growth in sales and earnings was driven by organic same-store sales growth and an overall increase in the number of stores expanding the Quick Lubes footprint in both the U.S. and Canada. For the year, system-wide same-store sales grew 10.1%, a record for full-year system-wide same-store sales growth, and represented the 13th consecutive year of same-store sales increases. This growth was driven by a balanced contribution from transaction growth and average ticket improvement due to effective marketing and customer retention, increased revenue from non-oil-change services, and favorable pricing and premium mix. The Quick Lubes system added 143 net new stores in fiscal 2019. Company-owned store growth was comprised of 28 newly-constructed stores and 29 acquired stores, which included the first company-owned stores outside the U.S. Strong franchise store growth of 86 stores included the Company's acquisition of Oil Changers franchised stores in Canada.\nValvoline's pension plans hold a variety of investments designed to diversify risk. Plan assets are invested in equity securities, government and agency securities, corporate debt, and other non-traditional assets such as hedge funds. The investment goal of the pension plans is to achieve an adequate net investment return to provide for future benefit payments to its participants. U.S. target asset allocation percentages as of September 30, 2019 were 25% equity and 75% fixed income investments. The U.S. pension plans are managed by professional investment managers that operate under investment management contracts that include specific investment guidelines, requiring among other actions, adequate diversification and prudent use of risk management practices such as portfolio constraints relating to established benchmarks. Valvoline's investment strategy and management practices relative to plan assets of non-U.S. plans generally are consistent except in those countries where investment of plan assets is dictated by applicable regulations.\nNet pension and other postretirement plan expense increased $60 million from the prior year primarily due to a loss on pension and other postretirement plan remeasurement of $69 million compared to a loss of $38 million in fiscal 2018. This change was primarily attributed to decreases in discount rates, which was partially offset by higher than expected return on plan assets and favorable changes in mortality assumptions. In addition, pension de-risking actions taken by the Company to shift the U.S. qualified plan's target asset allocation toward more fixed income securities and better match the asset duration to that of the pension plan obligations resulted in a lower expected return on plan assets and a decrease in related recurring non-service income.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe increase in gross profit was driven by favorable changes in volume and product mix, as well as the addition of acquired companies. The benefit of volume improvements in Quick Lubes and broad premium product mix increases more than offset the volume declines in Core North America and International, leading to a favorable combined volume and mix impact on gross profit. Offsetting these favorable impacts were decreases in gross profit related to the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance, currency exchange due to the strong U.S. dollar, and costs in excess of price, which\nChanges in assumptions or asset values may have a significant effect on the measurement of expense or income. Significant assumptions the Company must review and set annually and at each measurement date related to its pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are:\nSales\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nSame-store sales is defined as sales by Quick Lubes service center stores (company-owned, franchised or the combination of both for system-wide same-store sales), with new stores excluded from the metric until the completion of their first full fiscal year in operation because this period is generally required for new store sales levels to normalize. Valvoline does not recognize sales from franchised stores as Quick Lubes operating segment revenue. Quick Lubes revenue is limited to sales at company-owned stores, sales of lubricants and other products to franchisees, and royalties and other fees from franchised stores. Although Valvoline does not record franchise sales as revenue in its Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, management believes system-wide and franchised same-store sales information is useful to assess the operating performance of an average Quick Lubes store.\nValvoline is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous international jurisdictions. Judgment in forecasting taxable income using historical and projected future operating results is required in determining Valvoline's provision for income taxes and the related assets and liabilities. Each increase of $3 million to income tax expense would impact the fiscal 2019 effective tax rate by one percentage point.\n\nThe provision for income taxes includes current income taxes as well as deferred income taxes. Under U.S. GAAP, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the deferred assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized. The effect of changes in tax rates on deferred taxes is recognized in the period in which such changes are enacted.\n\nActuarial assumptions\nBUSINESS STRATEGY\nThe decrease in cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily driven by decreased share repurchase activity of $325 million and lower payments of $14 million related to the purchase of the remaining ownership interest in a consolidated subsidiary, which were partially offset by lower net proceeds from borrowings of $180 million and higher dividend payments of $22 million due to the increase in the quarterly dividend in fiscal 2019.\nIn the second fiscal quarter of 2019, the Company outlined a broad-based restructuring and cost-savings program that is expected to reduce costs, simplify processes and focus the organization's structure and resources on key growth initiatives. Valvoline's restructuring and cost-savings actions continue to progress, and Valvoline expects such actions will be largely implemented by the end of 2019. Part of this program includes employee separation actions, which are also expected to be generally completed by the end of 2019, with the associated termination benefits anticipated to be substantially paid by the end of 2020.\nIncome taxes\nThe increase in Adjusted EBITDA of $12 million in fiscal 2019 was driven by the performance of the Quick Lubes reportable segment and its system-wide same-store sales growth from an increase in both transactions and average ticket. The strong performance of the Quick Lubes reportable segment more than offset Adjusted EBITDA declines in the Core North America reportable segment. The declines in Core North America were primarily a result of decreased volume, including challenges within the retail customer channel.\nThe following summarizes income tax expense and the effective tax rate during the years ended September 30:\n\nThe decrease in income tax expense and the effective tax rate were principally driven by the prior year enactment of U.S. and Kentucky tax reform legislation, which resulted in the full year benefit of lower corporate statutory income tax rates in fiscal 2019 and reduced tax expense of approximately $78 million primarily related to the prior year remeasurement of net deferred tax assets at the lower corporate statutory income tax rates. In addition, benefits of approximately $10 million were recognized during fiscal 2019 related to accelerated deductions permitted by the provisions of U.S. tax reform, the expected utilization of tax attributes as a result of the clarification of certain provisions of Kentucky tax reform legislation, and the release of a valuation allowance.\n\u2022Rate of compensation increase - This assumption is no longer applicable to the U.S. pension plans due to the benefit accrual freeze as of September 30, 2016. In addition, some of the non-U.S. pension plans are also frozen, while those that remain open relate to areas where local laws require plans to operate within the applicable country. The weighted-average rate of compensation increase assumption for these non-U.S. plans was 3.06% for fiscal 2019.\nValuation of goodwill and other intangible assets\n\nKey Business Measures\n\u2022Overall lower volume in Core North America led to declines in sales and earnings during fiscal 2019. This decline in volume was primarily due to a decrease in branded volume in the retail channel driven by the market challenges that have affected Core North America throughout the year. Installer customer channel volumes were lower primarily due to changes with certain key accounts, as the underlying base business remained steady. Also impacting Core North America's results were unfavorable costs related to the temporary shutdown of the Company's second largest domestic blending facility and the new revenue recognition guidance that resulted in a decline in the segment's operating income.\nInternational sales decreased $16 million, or 3%, in fiscal 2019. The decline in sales was largely attributable to unfavorable currency exchange of $28 million, partially offset by favorable pricing and product mix that contributed approximately $18 million to sales and increases related to the acquisition of an Eastern European lubricant production company. During fiscal 2019, volumes decreased 1% compared to the prior year and reduced sales by $8 million. Solid volume growth in certain Asia-Pacific markets and EMEA, which included the benefit of the acquisition in Eastern Europe, were offset by declines in other regions, primarily driven by a slower heavy-duty aftermarket in China.\n\u2022Quick Lubes - services the passenger car and light truck quick lube market through company-owned and independent franchised retail quick lube service center stores and independent Express Care stores that service vehicles with Valvoline products, as well as through investment in a joint venture in China to pilot expansion of retail quick lube service center stores outside of North America.\nNet interest and other financing expense increased $10 million during fiscal 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was generally attributed to increased borrowing transactions during the current year, including the amendment of the 2016\n\nManagement uses lubricant volume from unconsolidated joint ventures to measure the operating performance of the International operating segment. Valvoline does not record lubricant sales from unconsolidated joint venture as International operating segment revenue. International revenue is limited to sales by consolidated affiliates. Although Valvoline does not record sales by unconsolidated joint ventures as revenue in its Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, management believes lubricant volume including and from unconsolidated joint ventures is useful to assess operating performance of investments in joint ventures.\n\u2022Expected long-term return on plan assets - Based on long-term historical actual asset return information, the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and future estimates of long-term investment returns. The Company also deducts various expenses using the fair value of plan assets to estimate expense. The weighted-average long-term expected rate of return on assets assumption was 4.66% for fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2019, the global pension plan assets generated an actual weighted-average return of 15.7%, primarily driven by the market performance of U.S. plan assets based on the Company's investment strategy to hedge plan assets with the movement in liabilities related to changes in the interest rates. However, the expected return on plan assets is designed to be a long-term assumption, and therefore, actual returns will be subject to year-to-year variances. The U.S. pension plans comprise the most significant portion of plan assets, and for fiscal 2020, the expected rate of return on assets assumption for the U.S. pension plans will be 4.70%. The expected long-term return on plan assets assumption has no impact on the reported net liability or net actuarial gains or losses upon remeasurement, but does impact the recognition of recurring non-service net periodic income recorded ratably on a quarterly basis.\nQuick Lubes sales increased $162 million, or 25%, during fiscal 2019. Volume growth in lubricant gallons and transactions driven by continued benefits from customer acquisition and retention programs increased sales by $66 million. The combination of executed pricing actions, increases in premium mix, and increases in non-oil-change services led to improved average ticket and increased sales by $40 million. The impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance increased sales by $36 million, and continued investments in acquisitions increased sales by $20 million.\nwithin a sufficiently narrow range of possible outcomes based on its extensive historical experience with certain customers, similar programs and management's judgment with respect to estimating customer participation and performance levels. Variable consideration is reassessed at each reporting date and adjustments are made, when necessary. The cost of these programs recognized as a reduction of sales totaled $346 million, $357 million and $360 million in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. A 10% change in the reserves for customer incentive programs as of September 30, 2019 would have affected net earnings by approximately $7 million in fiscal 2019.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were flat during the year compared to the prior year. Higher operating expenses, including an increase in allocated indirect corporate costs, were offset by decreases in compensation-related costs and favorable currency exchange.\nValvoline's business is managed within the following three reportable segments:\nFinancing activities\nContractual obligations and other commitments\nQuick Lubes\n\nNet pension and other postretirement plan expense\n\u2022Broadening capabilities to serve future transport vehicles by developing relationships with OEM and leveraging innovation in the development of future products and light services in direct and adjacent markets; and\nIf a trigger requiring impairment assessment occurred and the future undiscounted cash flows result in a value that is less than the carrying value, the intangible asset is considered impaired and a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value. Fair value is determined based on the highest and best use of the assets considered from the perspective of market participants, which may be different than the Company's actual intended use of the assets. Judgment is involved in identifying impairment triggering events, determining asset groups, future undiscounted cash flows and the fair value of asset groups.\nAt September 30, 2019, working capital (current assets minus current liabilities, excluding long-term debt due within one year) was $389 million compared to $344 million in 2018. Liquid assets (cash, cash equivalents, and accounts receivable) were 132% of current liabilities as of September 30, 2019 and 123% as of September 30, 2018. The increase in working capital is primarily related to higher cash and cash equivalents driven primarily by the timing of certain cash payments during the year, in addition to increased inventory.\n\n(a)Net pension and other postretirement plan income includes remeasurement gains and losses and recurring non-service pension and other postretirement net periodic income, which consists of interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service credit. Refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nSummary\nValvoline's goodwill impairment assessment could change in future periods if any or all of the following events were to occur with respect to a particular reporting unit: a significant change in projected business results, a divestiture decision, significant changes to certain cash flow assumptions, economic deterioration that is more severe or of a longer duration than anticipated, or other significant economic events.\nConsolidated review\n\u2022Healthcare cost trend rate - Because Valvoline's retiree healthcare plans contain various caps that limit Valvoline's contributions and as medical inflation is expected to continue at a rate in excess of these caps, the healthcare cost trend rate has not had a significant impact on Valvoline's postretirement healthcare benefit costs.\n\u2022EBITDA, which management defines as net income/loss, plus income tax expense/benefit, net interest and other financing expenses, and depreciation and amortization;\n\u2022International segment earnings increased modestly on roughly flat volume, with mixed results by region. The EMEA region showed strong volume growth during the year and provided benefits from the recent acquisition in Eastern Europe, which resulted in a bargain purchase gain. The Asia Pacific market had mixed results with improved volumes in many markets driven by channel development efforts that were more than offset by volume pressure in other markets, including China. The Latin American region had lower volumes from the prior year primarily related to the liquidation of the Company's subsidiary in Brazil completed in late fiscal 2018. Benefits from incentives received in fiscal 2019 for operating in a free-trade zone were more than offset by unfavorable currency movements and costs related to the temporary shutdown of the blending facility that also supports the International segment.\nactivities should primarily be relied upon as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow should only be used as supplements. In evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow, one should be aware that in the future Valvoline may incur expenses/income similar to those for which adjustments are made in calculating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow. Valvoline's presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow should not be construed as a basis to infer that Valvoline's future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items.\nThe Company closely manages its liquidity and capital resources. Valvoline's liquidity requirements depend on key variables, including the level of investment needed to support business strategies, the performance of the business, capital expenditures, borrowing arrangements, and working capital management. Capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, and dividend payments are components of the Company's cash flow and capital management strategy, which to a large extent, can be adjusted in response to economic and other changes in the business environment. The Company has a disciplined approach to capital allocation, which focuses on investing in key priorities that support Valvoline's business and growth strategies and returning capital to shareholders, while funding ongoing operations.\nOverview\n\u2022Key items - Key items consist of income or expenses associated with certain unusual, infrequent or non-operational income or expenses not directly attributable to the underlying business, which management believes impacts the comparability of operational results between periods. Key items may consist of adjustments related to: the impairment of an equity investment; legacy businesses, including the separation from Ashland and associated impacts of related indemnities; significant acquisitions or divestitures; restructuring-related matters; and other matters that are non-operational or unusual in nature. Key items are considered by management to be outside the comparable operational performance of the business and are also often related to legacy matters or market-driven events that are not directly related to the underlying business and do not have an immediate, corresponding impact on the Company's ongoing performance. Details with respect to the composition of key items recognized during the respective periods presented herein are set forth below in the EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\u201d section of Results of Operations\u201d that follows.\nValvoline's restructuring actions remain on track and are expected to generate annualized pre-tax savings of approximately $40 million to $50 million with modest benefits realized in late fiscal 2019 and full savings expected to be delivered by the end of fiscal 2020. The ongoing annual savings are anticipated to benefit operating expenses, including Cost of sales and Selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, with a portion expected to be reinvested in the business to provide flexibility to address the ongoing market dynamics in Core North America and to invest in growth opportunities.\nThese measures are not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and management believes the use of non-GAAP measures assists investors in understanding the ongoing operating performance of Valvoline's business by presenting comparable financial results between periods. The non-GAAP information provided is used by Valvoline's management and may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies, because of differing methods used by other companies in calculating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow provide a supplemental presentation of Valvoline's operating performance. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures, refer to the Results of Operations\u201d and Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d sections below.\nOther intangible assets\nInvesting activities\nValvoline sponsors defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the U.S and in certain countries outside the U.S. The majority of these plans were transferred to and assumed by the Company in the Contribution of certain of Ashland's pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets in late fiscal 2016. As of September 30, 2019, Valvoline's net unfunded pension and other postretirement plan liabilities included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet totaled $399 million, and the U.S. plans represented 95% of this total obligation. Total pension and other postretirement net periodic benefit costs included in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the year ended September 30, 2019 were:\nFor comparisons of Valvoline's consolidated and segment results of operations and consolidated cash flows for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 to September 30, 2017, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, filed with the SEC on November 21, 2018.", "item_7_text": "\u2022International - sells engine and automotive products in more than 140 countries outside of the United States and Canada for the maintenance of consumer and commercial vehicles and equipment.\n1.0% primarily resulting from the reclassification of certain costs in connection with the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance and dilutive impacts of new store operations, partially offset by mix improvements.\nGoodwill is tested at the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter as of July 1 or more frequently if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. Judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include a decline in expected cash flows, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, a decision to sell a business, unanticipated competition, or slower growth rates, among others. Valvoline's reporting units are consistent with its reportable segments\n\u2022Accelerating the shift to a services-driven business by leveraging customer relationships and experiences to develop new capabilities globally.\nThe increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was largely driven by restructuring and related expenses of $14 million recognized during fiscal 2019, as well as increases related to acquisitions, marketing and advertising, and compensation-related costs compared to 2018. These increases were partially offset by the favorable impacts of currency exchange and certain reclassifications related to the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance in fiscal 2019.\n(c)Valvoline unconsolidated joint ventures are distinct legal entities and Valvoline does not consolidate the result of operations of its unconsolidated joint ventures.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n* Valvoline's franchisees are distinct legal entities and Valvoline does not consolidate the results of operations of its franchisees.\nThe following table illustrates the estimated increases in hypothetical pension and other postretirement expense that would have resulted from a one percentage point change in isolation of any other impacts in each of the following significant assumptions in the years ended September 30:\n(b)Includes interest expense on both variable and fixed rate debt assuming no prepayments. Variable interest rates have been assumed to remain constant through the end of the term at the rates that existed as of September 30, 2019.\nValvoline recognizes the change in the fair value of plan assets and the net actuarial gains and losses calculated using updated actuarial assumptions as of the measurement date, which for Valvoline is September 30, and when a plan qualifies for an interim remeasurement. The remaining components of pension and other postretirement benefits income are recorded ratably on a quarterly basis. Due to the freeze of U.S. pension benefits effective September 30, 2016, continuing service costs are limited to certain international pension plans, and are reported in the same caption of the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income as the related employee payroll expenses. All components of net periodic benefit income other than service cost are recognized below operating income within Net pension and other postretirement plan expense in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The loss on pension and other postretirement plans remeasurement of $69 million in fiscal 2019 was primarily attributed to decreases in discount rates, partially offset by higher than expected returns on plan assets and favorable changes in mortality assumptions.\nThe decrease in cash flows used in investing activities for fiscal 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to lower cash consideration paid for acquisitions in the current year partially offset by increases in capital expenditures for company-owned quick lube new store openings and the Company's first blending and packaging plant in China. Lower proceeds related to the prior year sale of two Quick Lubes service center locations also contributed to the lower net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2019 compared to 2018.\nIn the United States and Canada, Valvoline's products and services are sold to retailers with over 50,000 retail outlets, to installer customers with over 15,000 locations, and through 1,385 franchised and company-owned stores. Valvoline also has a strong international presence with products sold in more than 140 countries. Valvoline serves its customer base through its sales force and technical support organization, allowing Valvoline to leverage its technology portfolio and customer relationships globally, while meeting customer demands locally. This combination of scale and strong local presence is critical to the Company's success.\nOperating activities\n\u2022Mortality - Based on the Society of Actuaries PRI-2012 mortality base tables and a mortality improvement scale that follows the 2019 Trustees Report of the Social Security Administration Intermediate Alternative as reflected in the MSS-2019 improvement scale. Valvoline believes the updated mortality improvement scales provide a reasonable assessment of current mortality trends and is an appropriate estimate of future mortality projections.\n\u2022Discount rate - Reflects the rates at which benefits could effectively be settled and is based on current investment yields of high-quality corporate bonds. Consistent with historical practice, the Company uses an actuarially-developed full yield curve approach, the above mean yield curve, to match the timing of cash flows of expected future benefit payments from the plans by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve to determine the assumed discount rate. Valvoline's fiscal 2019 expense, excluding actuarial gains and losses, for both U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans was determined using the spot discount rate as of the beginning of the fiscal year. The service cost and interest cost discount rates for fiscal 2019 pension expense were 2.92% and 4.00%, respectively, and 3.98% and 3.83%, respectively, for other postretirement expense. The weighted-average discount rate at the end of fiscal 2019 was 3.10% for the pension plans and 2.95% for the postretirement health and life plans.\nDividend payments\nNet operating expenses\nUnder the step one assessment, if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the amount of the impairment loss, if any, must be measured under \"step two\" of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, an impairment loss will be recorded equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill over its implied fair value. Fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a weighted methodology considering the output from both the income and market approaches. The income approach incorporates the use of a discounted cash flow ( DCF\u201d) analysis. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the DCF model to forecast operating cash flows, including markets and market shares, sales volumes and prices, costs to produce, tax rates, capital spending, discount rate and working capital changes. Several of these assumptions vary among reporting units, and the cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved strategic operating plans. The market approach is performed using the Guideline Public Companies method which is based on earnings multiple data. The Company also performs a reconciliation between market capitalization and the estimate of the aggregate fair value of the reporting units, including consideration of a control premium.\nThe increase in equity and other income, net was primarily related to the bargain purchase gain recognized in connection with the acquisition of an Eastern European lubricant production company and incentives received for operating in a free-trade zone outside the U.S., partially offset by a decrease in other income related to a gain recognized in fiscal 2018 due to the sale of two Quick Lubes stores.\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA, which management defines as EBITDA adjusted for key items, as further described below, and net pension and other postretirement plan expense/income; and\nThe following table presents sales, operating income and statistical operating information by reportable segment for the years ended September 30:\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nAs of September 30, 2019, Valvoline has no contractual obligations that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements that are not fully recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets or fully disclosed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As part of Valvoline's normal course of business, it is a party to certain financial guarantees and other commitments, and while these arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk that are not included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, such risk is not currently considered reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. The possibility that Valvoline would have to make actual cash expenditures in connection with these obligations is largely dependent on the performance of the party whose obligations Valvoline guarantees, or the occurrence of future events.\nManagement believes that the Company has sufficient liquidity based on its current cash position, cash generated from business operations, and existing financing to meet its required pension and other postretirement plan contributions, debt servicing obligations, tax-related and other contractual commitments, and operating requirements for the next twelve months.\nThe U.S. qualified pension plan comprises a substantial portion of Valvoline's total employee benefit plan obligation, and the investing strategy for its plan assets is targeted to hedge approximately 90% of the movement in liabilities related to changes in interest rates.\nTo aid in the understanding of Valvoline's ongoing business performance, certain items within this document are presented on an adjusted, non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP measures are not defined within U.S. GAAP and do not purport to be alternatives to net income/loss or cash flows from operating activities as measures of operating performance or cash flows. The following are the non-GAAP measures management has included and how management defines them:\nPension and other postretirement plan obligations\nManagement uses free cash flow as an additional non-GAAP metric of cash flow generation. By including capital expenditures and certain other adjustments, as applicable, management is able to provide an indication of the ongoing cash being generated that is ultimately available for both debt and equity holders as well as other investment opportunities. Unlike cash flow from operating activities, free cash flow includes the impact of capital expenditures, providing a more complete picture of cash generation. Free cash flow has certain limitations, including that it does not reflect adjustments for certain non-discretionary cash flows, such as mandatory debt repayments. The amount of mandatory versus discretionary expenditures can vary significantly between periods.\nAs of September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company had long-term debt (including the current portion and debt issuance costs and discounts) of $1.3 billion of loans and revolving facilities. Approximately 57% of Valvoline's outstanding borrowings as of September 30, 2019 had fixed rates, with the remainder bearing variable interest rates. As of September 30, 2019, Valvoline had $634 million of remaining borrowing capacity under its revolving facilities.\nReportable Segment Review\nThe decrease in gross profit margin was largely due to certain reclassifications related to the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance and the incremental business interruption expenses related to the temporary shutdown of the blending facility.\nValvoline's results of operations are presented based on Valvoline's management structure and internal accounting practices. The structure and practices are specific to Valvoline; therefore, Valvoline's financial results, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other comparable companies. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow each have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income and cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because of these limitations, net income and cash flows from operating\nValvoline tracks its operating performance and manages its business using certain key business measures, including system-wide and franchised same-store sales and lubricant volume from unconsolidated joint ventures, which management believes are important to understanding Valvoline's operating performance.\nThe Company is subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions, including those in the pre-Distribution periods. At any time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities and a number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which a liability has been established, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. In evaluating the exposures associated with various tax filing positions, including its indemnification obligations to Ashland, the Company may record liabilities for such exposures. The Company's liabilities for these matters are currently largely recorded within its indemnification obligation to Ashland. Valvoline generally adjusts its liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related indemnification obligations through earnings in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. Although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and may materially increase or decrease the effective tax rate, as well as impact the Company's operating results.\nInternational\nSelling, general and administrative expenses, which includes the allocation of shared costs, increased $29 million during fiscal 2019. These increases were primarily the result of higher allocation of shared costs and increased operating expenses, including costs associated with new store development teams, marketing and advertising.\nAs of September 30, 2019, the Company had $159 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, of which approximately $99 million was held by Valvoline's non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company utilizes a variety of strategies to deploy available cash in locations where it is needed. As a result of U.S. tax reform legislation, which provided the opportunity to mobilize cash with lower tax consequences, the Company does not indefinitely reinvest non-U.S. current and undistributed earnings. Withholding taxes are provided for within the income tax provision in the same period such earnings are generated. Certain other outside basis differences restricted by regulations, operational, or investing needs for non-U.S. subsidiaries remain indefinitely reinvested.\nEquity and other income increased by $9 million in fiscal 2019 primarily due to the $4 million bargain purchase gain resulting from the acquisition of the Eastern European lubricant production company and incentives received for operating in a free-trade zone. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable currency exchange.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses, which include the allocation of corporate costs, decreased $21 million during fiscal 2019 compared to 2018. This change is primarily attributable to the combination of lower allocated shared costs and reduced operating expenses of $13 million, as well as reclassifications related to the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance of $8 million.\nThe changes to reportable segment gross profit and the drivers thereof are discussed in further detail in Reportable Segment Review\u201d below.\nAs a result of the separation from Ashland, Valvoline agreed to indemnify Ashland for certain income tax matters. As of September 30, 2019, Valvoline's liability for these estimated indemnification obligations is $66 million. Valvoline generally records a liability when it is probable and reasonably estimable that indemnification will be due to Ashland and makes adjustments through earnings in the period that changes are known. Certain of these estimates require management to forecast its use of tax attributes generated in the pre-Distribution periods, as well as to evaluate the likelihood and potential magnitude of tax positions taken in consolidated Ashland returns in the periods prior to Distribution expected to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets are primarily established based on the allocation of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the acquisition date. Valvoline acquired 60 service center stores and a lubricant production company during fiscal 2019 for an aggregate purchase price of $78 million. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill or if the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceed the purchase price consideration, a bargain purchase gain is recorded. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, particularly with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flows, which includes consideration of future growth rates and margins, customer attrition rates, future changes in technology and brand awareness, and discount rates. Fair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. Identifiable intangible assets are primarily comprised of trademarks and trade names, reacquired franchise rights, and customer relationships.\nEmployee benefit obligations\nThe table below provides details of the components of net operating expenses during the years ended September 30:\nValvoline records revenue for the amount that reflects the consideration the Company is expected to be entitled to based on when control of the promised good or service is transferred to the customer. The nature of Valvoline's contracts with customers often give rise to variable consideration that generally decrease the transaction price and consist primarily of promotional rebates and customer pricing discounts based on achieving certain levels of sales activity. Variable consideration is recorded as a reduction of the transaction price at the time of sale and is primarily estimated utilizing the most likely amount method that is expected to be earned as the Company is able to estimate the anticipated discounts\nincluded incremental costs related to the temporary shutdown of the Company's second largest domestic blending facility due to a fire at a nearby third-party petrochemical terminal.\n(a)Non-service pension and other postretirement net periodic income includes the expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service credit, net of interest costs.\n(c)The operating lease obligations included on this table will be recorded on the balance sheet beginning in fiscal 2020 due to the Company's adoption of the new lease accounting guidance effective for the Company on October 1, 2019.\nFINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCash flows\nQuick Lubes sales are influenced by the number of service center stores and the business performance of those stores. The following tables provide supplemental information regarding company-owned and franchised stores that Valvoline believes is relevant to an understanding of the Quick Lubes business and its performance.\n\u2022Aggressively growing Quick Lubes through organic service center expansion and opportunistic acquisitions, while enhancing retail service capabilities through a consistent and preferred customer experience delivered by hands-on experts;\nThe following table sets forth free cash flow for the disclosed periods and reconciles cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow. As previously noted, free cash flow has certain limitations, including that it does not reflect adjustments for certain non-discretionary cash flows, such as mandatory debt repayments. Refer to Use of Non-GAAP Measures\u201d within this Item 7 for additional information regarding this non-GAAP measure.\n\u2022On April 12, 2019, Valvoline amended its 2016 Credit Agreement to provide additional capacity under the revolving facility, lower interest rates, and extend the maturity to 2024. Proceeds from the amendment were used to pay down balances on the 2016 Term Loan, the 2016 Revolver, and the Trade Receivables Facility, and the remaining proceeds, including the undrawn amended revolving credit facility, are primarily expected to fund general corporate purposes and working capital needs.\nGoodwill\nCredit Agreement, which resulted in additional expenses associated with executing the transaction and higher outstanding debt.\n\nThe Valvoline blending facility in Texas that was temporarily shut down near the end of the second fiscal quarter of 2019, due to a nearby third-party fire and resulting chemical releases, sustained no damage, reopened and resumed operations in late April 2019. The Company quickly addressed the shutdown by utilizing its supply chain to shift production and minimize business impacts in order to fulfill customer orders timely. These actions resulted in incremental expenses of $6 million during fiscal 2019. Management is pursuing insurance recoveries related to the business interruption and does not expect to incur additional incremental costs beyond fiscal 2019.\nValvoline is a worldwide marketer and supplier of engine and automotive maintenance products and services. Established in 1866, Valvoline's heritage spans over 150 years, during which it has developed powerful name recognition across multiple product and service channels. In addition to the iconic Valvoline-branded passenger car motor oils and other automotive lubricant products, Valvoline provides a wide array of lubricants used in heavy duty equipment, as well as automotive chemicals and fluids designed to improve engine performance and lifespan. Valvoline's premium branded product offerings enhance its high-quality reputation and provide customers with solutions that address a wide variety of needs.\n(b)Excludes volumes from unconsolidated subsidiaries.\nThere were no significant impairments recognized by the Company during fiscal 2019, 2018 or 2017.\nThe following were the significant events for fiscal 2019, each of which is discussed more fully in this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(d)Includes estimated funding of pension plans for fiscal 2020, as well as projected benefit payments through fiscal 2029 for Valvoline's unfunded pension plans. Excludes benefit payments from pension plan trust funds.\nThe decrease in net legacy and separation-related expenses was largely related to the effects of the enactment of U.S. and Kentucky tax reform in fiscal 2018, which drove net increases to the estimated indemnities due to Ashland under the Tax Matters Agreement. Furthermore, the decrease is related to lower legacy multiemployer pension plan partial withdrawal assessment costs recognized in fiscal 2019.\n\u2022During fiscal 2019, Valvoline paid $80 million, $0.424 per common share, in cash dividends to its shareholders.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2019, the Company paid $80 million of cash dividends for $0.424 per common share. On November 14, 2019, the Board of Directors of Valvoline declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.113 per share of Valvoline common stock, which is payable on December 16, 2019 to shareholders of record on November 29, 2019. Future declarations of quarterly dividends are subject to approval by the Board of Directors and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change.\nAlthough no qualitative factors were present that indicated the existence of a potential impairment, Valvoline elected to perform a quantitative assessment during fiscal 2019 and determined that each reporting unit had a fair value that exceeded its carrying value by 130% and more. In fiscal 2018 and 2017, Valvoline performed qualitative assessments and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of Valvoline's reporting units were in excess of carrying amounts.\nGross profit\nFISCAL 2019 OVERVIEW\nFor a discussion and analysis of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements and the impact on Valvoline, refer to Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn evaluating goodwill for impairment, Valvoline has the option to first perform a qualitative \"step zero\" assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary or to perform a quantitative \"step one\" assessment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. Under the qualitative assessment, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. Qualitative factors include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, and overall financial performance, among others. The consideration of these factors requires significant judgment and estimates and application of alternative assumptions could produce different results.\nDuring fiscal 2019, the Company made cash and non-cash contributions of approximately $14 million to its U.S. non-qualified and non-U.S. pension plans. Refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information relating to the Company's pension and other postretirement plans.\nThe changes to reportable segment sales and the drivers thereof are discussed in further detail in Reportable Segment Review\u201d below.\nThe Quick Lubes system added 143 net new stores in fiscal 2019. Company-owned store growth was comprised of 28 newly-constructed stores and 29 acquired stores, which included the first company-owned stores outside the U.S. in Canada. Franchisee expansion into key markets continued and added 86 stores, including the Company's acquisition of Oil Changers franchised stores in Canada.\nValvoline's cash flows as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are summarized as follows for the years ended September 30:\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nof Quick Lubes ($301 million in goodwill as of September 30, 2019), Core North America ($89 million in goodwill as of September 30, 2019), and International ($40 million in goodwill as of September 30, 2019).\nNet interest and other financing expenses\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\n(b)Losses on pension and other postretirement plans remeasurement include the change in the actual return on plan assets and net actuarial losses upon remeasurement as of September 30, 2019.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nManagement also believes Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with a meaningful supplemental presentation of Valvoline's operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of the following:\nGross profit increased $56 million during fiscal 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to an increase in both transactions and average ticket. Increases in volumes and mix improvements combined to increase gross profit by $38 million. Acquisitions increased gross profit by $10 million, while implemented price increases improved gross profit by $5 million. Adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance increased gross profit by $3 million. Gross profit margin decreased\nFree cash flow and other liquidity information\nAs a result of this restructuring program, Valvoline recognized $14 million of restructuring and related expenses during the year ended September 30, 2019. The Company expects that it will incur additional restructuring expenses of approximately $1 million during the first fiscal quarter of 2020. Restructuring expenses include employee severance and termination benefits that will be paid to employees pursuant to the restructuring program. Restructuring-related expenses consist of those costs which are beyond those normally included in restructuring and incremental to the Company's normal operating costs. These restructuring-related costs were expensed as incurred and primarily related to third-party professional service fees incurred in connection with execution of the restructuring program.\nThe increase in cash flows provided by operating activities during fiscal 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to favorable working capital driven by the timing of payments partially offset by increased interest payments.\n\nDue to depreciable assets associated with the nature of the Company's operations and interest costs related to Valvoline's capital structure, management believes EBITDA is an important supplemental measure to evaluate the Company's operating results between periods on a comparable basis.\nGross profit decreased $43 million during fiscal 2019 compared to 2018. The adoption of new revenue recognition guidance resulted in certain reclassifications and impacted the timing of certain distributor sales, which decreased gross profit by $12 million. Volume declines, which included the shift of Great Canadian Oil Change to Quick Lubes, impacted gross profit by $27 million. Also negatively impacting gross profit were costs in excess of pricing of $7 million, which included $4 million related to the temporary shutdown of the Company's second largest domestic blending facility due to the fire at a nearby third-party petrochemical terminal. These declines were partially offset by $3 million of improvements related to increased premium product mix.\nResults for Fiscal 2018 compared to Fiscal 2017\nRefer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details regarding this restructuring program.\nGross profit margin decreased 2.9% compared to the prior year. This decline was primarily the result of incremental business interruption expenses related to the temporary shutdown of the blending facility, the impact related to the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance and the dilutive impact on margin rate of passing through cost increases.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCapital expenditures are anticipated to increase to $160 million to $170 million in fiscal 2020 due to company store growth and investments related to the Company's first blending and packaging plant in China to meet the country's growing demand for premium lubricants and coolants. Capital expenditures related to this investment were approximately $18 million in fiscal 2019, and the Company expects an additional $40 million to $50 million in fiscal 2020.\n\nEquity and other income for the Quick Lubes segment declined in the current fiscal year as the prior fiscal year included a $3 million gain related to the sale of two service center stores.\nCore North America sales decreased $41 million, or 4%, to $994 million during fiscal 2019, which was driven largely by volume decreases of $54 million primarily due to reductions in branded volume in the retail channel. The shift of newly acquired Great Canadian Oil Change product sales to the Quick Lubes reportable segment also negatively impacted Core North America sales by $13 million. Partially offsetting these declines were favorable pricing and premium product mix of $14 million and an increase related to the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance of $14 million.\nValuation allowances are established when necessary on a jurisdictional basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence, which includes historical profitability, future market growth, future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. The Company assesses deferred taxes and the adequacy or need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. As of September 30, 2019, the Company had $180 million of deferred tax assets, including $2 million in valuation allowances. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient future taxable income, there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates, the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, or if the tax laws change unfavorably, then Valvoline could be required to increase the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, resulting in an increase in income tax expense and the effective tax rate.\n\u2022Net pension and other postretirement plan expense/income - Net pension and other postretirement plan expense/income includes several elements impacted by changes in plan assets and obligations that are primarily driven by changes in the debt and equity markets, as well as those that are predominantly legacy in nature and related to prior service to the Company from employees (e.g., retirees, former employees, current employees with frozen benefits). These elements include (i) interest cost, (ii) expected return on plan assets, (iii) actuarial gains/losses, and (iv) amortization of prior service cost/credit. Significant factors that can contribute to changes in these elements include changes in discount rates used to remeasure pension and other postretirement obligations on an annual basis or upon a qualifying remeasurement, differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets, and other changes in actuarial assumptions, such as the life expectancy of plan participants. Accordingly, management considers that these elements are more reflective of changes in current conditions in global financial markets (in particular, interest rates) and are outside the operational performance of the business and are also primarily legacy amounts that are not directly related to the underlying business and do not have an immediate, corresponding impact on the compensation and benefits provided to eligible employees for current service. Adjusted EBITDA will continue to include pension and other postretirement service costs related to current employee service as well as the costs of other benefits provided to employees for current service.\nTotal other intangible assets were $74 million, net of $18 million of accumulated amortization as of September 30, 2019. Other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Various factors are considered in determining whether a trigger requiring impairment assessment has occurred, such as changes in the expected use of the assets, changes in technology or development of alternative assets, changes in economic conditions, changes in operating performance and changes in expected future cash flows.\nThe preparation of Valvoline's consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and the disclosures of contingent matters. Significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, long-lived assets (including intangible assets and goodwill), customer incentives, employee benefit obligations and income taxes. Although management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nRefer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details regarding the Company's debt instruments.\nRestructuring and related expenses\n\u2022Accelerating International market share growth through continued development of and investment in key emerging and high value markets;\n** Valvoline determines same-store sales growth on a fiscal year basis, with new stores excluded from the metric until the completion of their first full fiscal year in operation.\nResults by segment do not include these restructuring and related expenses, which is consistent with the manner by which management assesses the performance and evaluates the results of each segment. Accordingly, these expenses were included in Unallocated and other.\nDebt\n\u2022Strengthening and maintaining the foundation in Core North America by leveraging investments in technology and marketing to drive speed, efficiency and value across the business and customer interactions, while increasing penetration of Valvoline's full product portfolio;\n\nAccordingly, system-wide and franchised same store sales and lubricant volume, including unconsolidated joint ventures should be considered as supplements to, not substitutes for, Valvoline's sales, as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n(a)Other long-term liabilities of approximately $130 million are excluded from this table as the uncertainty related to the amount and period of cash settlements prevents the Company from making a reasonably reliable estimate. These other long-term liabilities include the Company's net obligations to its former parent company, deferred compensation, unrecognized tax benefits, and self-insurance liabilities that primarily related to workers' compensation claims, among others.\nValvoline's key business and growth strategies include:\nValvoline's reportable segments are measured for profitability based on operating income; therefore, Valvoline does not generally allocate items to each reportable segment below operating income, such as net pension and other postretirement plan expense, net interest and other financing expenses or income tax expense. Operating income by segment includes the allocation of shared corporate costs, which are allocated consistently based on each segment's proportional contribution to various financial measures. Valvoline does not allocate certain significant corporate and non-operational matters, including, but not limited to, company-wide restructuring activities and costs or adjustments that relate to former businesses that Valvoline no longer operates. These matters are attributed to Unallocated and other. Results of Valvoline's reportable segments are presented based on how operations are managed internally, including how the results are reviewed by the chief operating decision maker. The structure and practices are specific to Valvoline; therefore, the financial results of its reportable segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other comparable companies.\n\nThe following table sets forth Valvoline's obligations and commitments to make future payments under existing contracts at September 30, 2019. Excluded from the table are contractual obligations for which the ultimate settlement of quantities or prices are not fixed and determinable.\nKey drivers of the increase in sales from the prior year were higher product pricing, favorable product mix, acquisitions, and the impact related to the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance, partially offset by unfavorable currency exchange. The effects of volume improvements in Quick Lubes more than offset declines in Core North America and International, favorably impacting sales during the period. During fiscal 2019, lubricant gallons sold decreased 2% to 178.4 million.\n\n\u2022Core North America - sells engine and automotive maintenance products in the United States and Canada to retailers, installers, and heavy-duty customers to service vehicles and equipment.\nRestructuring and related expenses were recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses within the Company's Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income as follows for the year ended September 30:\nAs of September 30, 2019, cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash totaled $159 million and total debt was $1.3 billion. Valvoline's ability to generate positive cash flows from operations is dependent on general economic conditions, the competitive environment in the industry, and is subject to the business and other risk factors described in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or otherwise comply with the terms of its credit facilities, Valvoline may be required to seek additional financing alternatives. The Company's total remaining borrowing capacity was $634 million as of September 30, 2019, and Valvoline was in compliance with all covenants of its debt obligations as of September 30, 2019.\nCustomer incentives\nValvoline's fiscal year ends on September 30 of each year, and Valvoline has three reportable segments: Quick Lubes, Core North America, and International, with certain corporate and non-operational items included in Unallocated and Other to reconcile to consolidated results. Refer to Item 1 included in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of Valvoline's reportable segments.\nThe following table summarizes the results of the Company's operations for the years ended September 30:\n\u2022Free cash flow, which management defines as operating cash flows less capital expenditures and certain other adjustments as applicable.\n\nGross profit decreased by $9 million during fiscal 2019 compared to 2018. This decrease was primarily related to unfavorable currency exchange of $7 million and incremental costs of $2 million related to the temporary shutdown of the Company's second largest domestic blending facility due to the fire at a nearby third-party petrochemical terminal. Gross profit margin during fiscal 2019 decreased 0.8% primarily related to the incremental business interruption expenses related to the temporary shutdown of the blending facility and the dilutive impact on margin rate of passing through cost increases.\nCore North America\nOn April 12, 2019, Valvoline amended the 2016 Credit Agreement to extend the maturity to 2024, provide additional capacity under the revolving facility, and lower interest rates. The 2019 Term Loan proceeds of $575 million were used to pay the outstanding principal balance of the 2016 Term Loan of $255 million, the outstanding 2016 Revolver balance of $186 million, and $120 million on the Trade Receivables Facility, in addition to accrued and unpaid interest and fees, as well as expenses related to the amendment. Remaining proceeds from the amendment, including the 2019 Revolver capacity, are expected to fund general corporate purposes and working capital needs.\nIncome tax expense\nThe following table reconciles net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended September 30:\nThe Company's pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on actuarial valuations and various assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liabilities relating to these plans. These assumptions include estimates and judgments the Company makes about interest rates, expected long-term investment return on plan assets, rate of increase in healthcare costs, rates of future compensation increases and mortality. Though management considers current market conditions and other relevant factors in establishing these assumptions, the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, longer or shorter life spans of participants, and differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets. These differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension or other postretirement benefits cost recorded or that may be recorded.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the changes in sales from fiscal 2018 to 2019:\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the changes in gross profit from fiscal 2018 to 2019:\n(a)Gross profit as a percent of sales is defined as sales, less cost of sales, divided by sales.\n\n\u2022Quick Lubes growth in sales and earnings was driven by organic same-store sales growth and an overall increase in the number of stores expanding the Quick Lubes footprint in both the U.S. and Canada. For the year, system-wide same-store sales grew 10.1%, a record for full-year system-wide same-store sales growth, and represented the 13th consecutive year of same-store sales increases. This growth was driven by a balanced contribution from transaction growth and average ticket improvement due to effective marketing and customer retention, increased revenue from non-oil-change services, and favorable pricing and premium mix. The Quick Lubes system added 143 net new stores in fiscal 2019. Company-owned store growth was comprised of 28 newly-constructed stores and 29 acquired stores, which included the first company-owned stores outside the U.S. Strong franchise store growth of 86 stores included the Company's acquisition of Oil Changers franchised stores in Canada.\nValvoline's pension plans hold a variety of investments designed to diversify risk. Plan assets are invested in equity securities, government and agency securities, corporate debt, and other non-traditional assets such as hedge funds. The investment goal of the pension plans is to achieve an adequate net investment return to provide for future benefit payments to its participants. U.S. target asset allocation percentages as of September 30, 2019 were 25% equity and 75% fixed income investments. The U.S. pension plans are managed by professional investment managers that operate under investment management contracts that include specific investment guidelines, requiring among other actions, adequate diversification and prudent use of risk management practices such as portfolio constraints relating to established benchmarks. Valvoline's investment strategy and management practices relative to plan assets of non-U.S. plans generally are consistent except in those countries where investment of plan assets is dictated by applicable regulations.\nNet pension and other postretirement plan expense increased $60 million from the prior year primarily due to a loss on pension and other postretirement plan remeasurement of $69 million compared to a loss of $38 million in fiscal 2018. This change was primarily attributed to decreases in discount rates, which was partially offset by higher than expected return on plan assets and favorable changes in mortality assumptions. In addition, pension de-risking actions taken by the Company to shift the U.S. qualified plan's target asset allocation toward more fixed income securities and better match the asset duration to that of the pension plan obligations resulted in a lower expected return on plan assets and a decrease in related recurring non-service income.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe increase in gross profit was driven by favorable changes in volume and product mix, as well as the addition of acquired companies. The benefit of volume improvements in Quick Lubes and broad premium product mix increases more than offset the volume declines in Core North America and International, leading to a favorable combined volume and mix impact on gross profit. Offsetting these favorable impacts were decreases in gross profit related to the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance, currency exchange due to the strong U.S. dollar, and costs in excess of price, which\nChanges in assumptions or asset values may have a significant effect on the measurement of expense or income. Significant assumptions the Company must review and set annually and at each measurement date related to its pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are:\nSales\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nSame-store sales is defined as sales by Quick Lubes service center stores (company-owned, franchised or the combination of both for system-wide same-store sales), with new stores excluded from the metric until the completion of their first full fiscal year in operation because this period is generally required for new store sales levels to normalize. Valvoline does not recognize sales from franchised stores as Quick Lubes operating segment revenue. Quick Lubes revenue is limited to sales at company-owned stores, sales of lubricants and other products to franchisees, and royalties and other fees from franchised stores. Although Valvoline does not record franchise sales as revenue in its Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, management believes system-wide and franchised same-store sales information is useful to assess the operating performance of an average Quick Lubes store.\nValvoline is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous international jurisdictions. Judgment in forecasting taxable income using historical and projected future operating results is required in determining Valvoline's provision for income taxes and the related assets and liabilities. Each increase of $3 million to income tax expense would impact the fiscal 2019 effective tax rate by one percentage point.\n\nThe provision for income taxes includes current income taxes as well as deferred income taxes. Under U.S. GAAP, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the deferred assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized. The effect of changes in tax rates on deferred taxes is recognized in the period in which such changes are enacted.\n\nActuarial assumptions\nBUSINESS STRATEGY\nThe decrease in cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily driven by decreased share repurchase activity of $325 million and lower payments of $14 million related to the purchase of the remaining ownership interest in a consolidated subsidiary, which were partially offset by lower net proceeds from borrowings of $180 million and higher dividend payments of $22 million due to the increase in the quarterly dividend in fiscal 2019.\nIn the second fiscal quarter of 2019, the Company outlined a broad-based restructuring and cost-savings program that is expected to reduce costs, simplify processes and focus the organization's structure and resources on key growth initiatives. Valvoline's restructuring and cost-savings actions continue to progress, and Valvoline expects such actions will be largely implemented by the end of 2019. Part of this program includes employee separation actions, which are also expected to be generally completed by the end of 2019, with the associated termination benefits anticipated to be substantially paid by the end of 2020.\nIncome taxes\nThe increase in Adjusted EBITDA of $12 million in fiscal 2019 was driven by the performance of the Quick Lubes reportable segment and its system-wide same-store sales growth from an increase in both transactions and average ticket. The strong performance of the Quick Lubes reportable segment more than offset Adjusted EBITDA declines in the Core North America reportable segment. The declines in Core North America were primarily a result of decreased volume, including challenges within the retail customer channel.\nThe following summarizes income tax expense and the effective tax rate during the years ended September 30:\n\nThe decrease in income tax expense and the effective tax rate were principally driven by the prior year enactment of U.S. and Kentucky tax reform legislation, which resulted in the full year benefit of lower corporate statutory income tax rates in fiscal 2019 and reduced tax expense of approximately $78 million primarily related to the prior year remeasurement of net deferred tax assets at the lower corporate statutory income tax rates. In addition, benefits of approximately $10 million were recognized during fiscal 2019 related to accelerated deductions permitted by the provisions of U.S. tax reform, the expected utilization of tax attributes as a result of the clarification of certain provisions of Kentucky tax reform legislation, and the release of a valuation allowance.\n\u2022Rate of compensation increase - This assumption is no longer applicable to the U.S. pension plans due to the benefit accrual freeze as of September 30, 2016. In addition, some of the non-U.S. pension plans are also frozen, while those that remain open relate to areas where local laws require plans to operate within the applicable country. The weighted-average rate of compensation increase assumption for these non-U.S. plans was 3.06% for fiscal 2019.\nValuation of goodwill and other intangible assets\n\nKey Business Measures\n\u2022Overall lower volume in Core North America led to declines in sales and earnings during fiscal 2019. This decline in volume was primarily due to a decrease in branded volume in the retail channel driven by the market challenges that have affected Core North America throughout the year. Installer customer channel volumes were lower primarily due to changes with certain key accounts, as the underlying base business remained steady. Also impacting Core North America's results were unfavorable costs related to the temporary shutdown of the Company's second largest domestic blending facility and the new revenue recognition guidance that resulted in a decline in the segment's operating income.\nInternational sales decreased $16 million, or 3%, in fiscal 2019. The decline in sales was largely attributable to unfavorable currency exchange of $28 million, partially offset by favorable pricing and product mix that contributed approximately $18 million to sales and increases related to the acquisition of an Eastern European lubricant production company. During fiscal 2019, volumes decreased 1% compared to the prior year and reduced sales by $8 million. Solid volume growth in certain Asia-Pacific markets and EMEA, which included the benefit of the acquisition in Eastern Europe, were offset by declines in other regions, primarily driven by a slower heavy-duty aftermarket in China.\n\u2022Quick Lubes - services the passenger car and light truck quick lube market through company-owned and independent franchised retail quick lube service center stores and independent Express Care stores that service vehicles with Valvoline products, as well as through investment in a joint venture in China to pilot expansion of retail quick lube service center stores outside of North America.\nNet interest and other financing expense increased $10 million during fiscal 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was generally attributed to increased borrowing transactions during the current year, including the amendment of the 2016\n\nManagement uses lubricant volume from unconsolidated joint ventures to measure the operating performance of the International operating segment. Valvoline does not record lubricant sales from unconsolidated joint venture as International operating segment revenue. International revenue is limited to sales by consolidated affiliates. Although Valvoline does not record sales by unconsolidated joint ventures as revenue in its Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, management believes lubricant volume including and from unconsolidated joint ventures is useful to assess operating performance of investments in joint ventures.\n\u2022Expected long-term return on plan assets - Based on long-term historical actual asset return information, the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and future estimates of long-term investment returns. The Company also deducts various expenses using the fair value of plan assets to estimate expense. The weighted-average long-term expected rate of return on assets assumption was 4.66% for fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2019, the global pension plan assets generated an actual weighted-average return of 15.7%, primarily driven by the market performance of U.S. plan assets based on the Company's investment strategy to hedge plan assets with the movement in liabilities related to changes in the interest rates. However, the expected return on plan assets is designed to be a long-term assumption, and therefore, actual returns will be subject to year-to-year variances. The U.S. pension plans comprise the most significant portion of plan assets, and for fiscal 2020, the expected rate of return on assets assumption for the U.S. pension plans will be 4.70%. The expected long-term return on plan assets assumption has no impact on the reported net liability or net actuarial gains or losses upon remeasurement, but does impact the recognition of recurring non-service net periodic income recorded ratably on a quarterly basis.\nQuick Lubes sales increased $162 million, or 25%, during fiscal 2019. Volume growth in lubricant gallons and transactions driven by continued benefits from customer acquisition and retention programs increased sales by $66 million. The combination of executed pricing actions, increases in premium mix, and increases in non-oil-change services led to improved average ticket and increased sales by $40 million. The impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance increased sales by $36 million, and continued investments in acquisitions increased sales by $20 million.\nwithin a sufficiently narrow range of possible outcomes based on its extensive historical experience with certain customers, similar programs and management's judgment with respect to estimating customer participation and performance levels. Variable consideration is reassessed at each reporting date and adjustments are made, when necessary. The cost of these programs recognized as a reduction of sales totaled $346 million, $357 million and $360 million in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. A 10% change in the reserves for customer incentive programs as of September 30, 2019 would have affected net earnings by approximately $7 million in fiscal 2019.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were flat during the year compared to the prior year. Higher operating expenses, including an increase in allocated indirect corporate costs, were offset by decreases in compensation-related costs and favorable currency exchange.\nValvoline's business is managed within the following three reportable segments:\nFinancing activities\nContractual obligations and other commitments\nQuick Lubes\n\nNet pension and other postretirement plan expense\n\u2022Broadening capabilities to serve future transport vehicles by developing relationships with OEM and leveraging innovation in the development of future products and light services in direct and adjacent markets; and\nIf a trigger requiring impairment assessment occurred and the future undiscounted cash flows result in a value that is less than the carrying value, the intangible asset is considered impaired and a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value. Fair value is determined based on the highest and best use of the assets considered from the perspective of market participants, which may be different than the Company's actual intended use of the assets. Judgment is involved in identifying impairment triggering events, determining asset groups, future undiscounted cash flows and the fair value of asset groups.\nAt September 30, 2019, working capital (current assets minus current liabilities, excluding long-term debt due within one year) was $389 million compared to $344 million in 2018. Liquid assets (cash, cash equivalents, and accounts receivable) were 132% of current liabilities as of September 30, 2019 and 123% as of September 30, 2018. The increase in working capital is primarily related to higher cash and cash equivalents driven primarily by the timing of certain cash payments during the year, in addition to increased inventory.\n\n(a)Net pension and other postretirement plan income includes remeasurement gains and losses and recurring non-service pension and other postretirement net periodic income, which consists of interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service credit. Refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nSummary\nValvoline's goodwill impairment assessment could change in future periods if any or all of the following events were to occur with respect to a particular reporting unit: a significant change in projected business results, a divestiture decision, significant changes to certain cash flow assumptions, economic deterioration that is more severe or of a longer duration than anticipated, or other significant economic events.\nConsolidated review\n\u2022Healthcare cost trend rate - Because Valvoline's retiree healthcare plans contain various caps that limit Valvoline's contributions and as medical inflation is expected to continue at a rate in excess of these caps, the healthcare cost trend rate has not had a significant impact on Valvoline's postretirement healthcare benefit costs.\n\u2022EBITDA, which management defines as net income/loss, plus income tax expense/benefit, net interest and other financing expenses, and depreciation and amortization;\n\u2022International segment earnings increased modestly on roughly flat volume, with mixed results by region. The EMEA region showed strong volume growth during the year and provided benefits from the recent acquisition in Eastern Europe, which resulted in a bargain purchase gain. The Asia Pacific market had mixed results with improved volumes in many markets driven by channel development efforts that were more than offset by volume pressure in other markets, including China. The Latin American region had lower volumes from the prior year primarily related to the liquidation of the Company's subsidiary in Brazil completed in late fiscal 2018. Benefits from incentives received in fiscal 2019 for operating in a free-trade zone were more than offset by unfavorable currency movements and costs related to the temporary shutdown of the blending facility that also supports the International segment.\nactivities should primarily be relied upon as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow should only be used as supplements. In evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow, one should be aware that in the future Valvoline may incur expenses/income similar to those for which adjustments are made in calculating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow. Valvoline's presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow should not be construed as a basis to infer that Valvoline's future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items.\nThe Company closely manages its liquidity and capital resources. Valvoline's liquidity requirements depend on key variables, including the level of investment needed to support business strategies, the performance of the business, capital expenditures, borrowing arrangements, and working capital management. Capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, and dividend payments are components of the Company's cash flow and capital management strategy, which to a large extent, can be adjusted in response to economic and other changes in the business environment. The Company has a disciplined approach to capital allocation, which focuses on investing in key priorities that support Valvoline's business and growth strategies and returning capital to shareholders, while funding ongoing operations.\nOverview\n\u2022Key items - Key items consist of income or expenses associated with certain unusual, infrequent or non-operational income or expenses not directly attributable to the underlying business, which management believes impacts the comparability of operational results between periods. Key items may consist of adjustments related to: the impairment of an equity investment; legacy businesses, including the separation from Ashland and associated impacts of related indemnities; significant acquisitions or divestitures; restructuring-related matters; and other matters that are non-operational or unusual in nature. Key items are considered by management to be outside the comparable operational performance of the business and are also often related to legacy matters or market-driven events that are not directly related to the underlying business and do not have an immediate, corresponding impact on the Company's ongoing performance. Details with respect to the composition of key items recognized during the respective periods presented herein are set forth below in the EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\u201d section of Results of Operations\u201d that follows.\nValvoline's restructuring actions remain on track and are expected to generate annualized pre-tax savings of approximately $40 million to $50 million with modest benefits realized in late fiscal 2019 and full savings expected to be delivered by the end of fiscal 2020. The ongoing annual savings are anticipated to benefit operating expenses, including Cost of sales and Selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, with a portion expected to be reinvested in the business to provide flexibility to address the ongoing market dynamics in Core North America and to invest in growth opportunities.\nThese measures are not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and management believes the use of non-GAAP measures assists investors in understanding the ongoing operating performance of Valvoline's business by presenting comparable financial results between periods. The non-GAAP information provided is used by Valvoline's management and may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies, because of differing methods used by other companies in calculating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow provide a supplemental presentation of Valvoline's operating performance. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures, refer to the Results of Operations\u201d and Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d sections below.\nOther intangible assets\nInvesting activities\nValvoline sponsors defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the U.S and in certain countries outside the U.S. The majority of these plans were transferred to and assumed by the Company in the Contribution of certain of Ashland's pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets in late fiscal 2016. As of September 30, 2019, Valvoline's net unfunded pension and other postretirement plan liabilities included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet totaled $399 million, and the U.S. plans represented 95% of this total obligation. Total pension and other postretirement net periodic benefit costs included in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the year ended September 30, 2019 were:\nFor comparisons of Valvoline's consolidated and segment results of operations and consolidated cash flows for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 to September 30, 2017, refer to Part II, Item 7.

automotive maintenance products and services. It has three reportable business segments: Quick Lubes, Core North America, and International.\n\n- In fiscal 2019, sales increased 5% to $2.4 billion compared to fiscal 2018. The increase was driven by higher product pricing, favorable product mix, acquisitions, and new revenue recognition standards, partially offset by unfavorable currency exchange. \n\n- Gross profit increased slightly in 2019 while net income increased 25% to $208 million. This was primarily due to lower income tax expense from U.S. tax reform.\n\n- EBITDA was $399 million in 2019 compared to $449 million in 2018. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes certain items like restructuring costs, increased to $478 million from $466 million.\n\n- Operating cash flows were $325 million in 2019 versus $320 million in 2018. Free cash flow was $217 million compared to $227 million.\n\n- The Quick Lubes segment showed strong growth from same-store sales increases. Core North America declined due to lower volumes, while International was impacted by currency exchange. \n\n- The company continued its share repurchase program and dividend payments, returning cash to shareholders.\n\n- Valvoline expects to continue investing in growth opportunities, particularly in Quick Lubes and China expansion.\n\nIn summary, Valvoline showed moderate sales growth and margin expansion in 2019, while generating solid cash flows and returns to shareholders. The company is focused on business investments to drive future growth."}
