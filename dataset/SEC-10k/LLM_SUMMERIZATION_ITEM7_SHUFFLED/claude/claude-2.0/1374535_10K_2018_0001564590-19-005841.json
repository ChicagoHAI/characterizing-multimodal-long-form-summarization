FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT. EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW, WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO PUBLICLY UPDATE OR RELEASE ANY REVISIONS TO THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS TO REFLECT ANY EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES AFTER THE\nDATE OF THIS REPORT OR TO REFLECT THE OCCURRENCE OF UNANTICIPATED EVENTS. ALL SUBSEQUENT WRITTEN AND ORAL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO US OR ANY PERSON ACTING ON THE COMPANY'S BEHALF ARE EXPRESSLY QUALIFIED IN THEIR ENTIRETY BY THE CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS CONTAINED OR REFERRED TO IN THIS SECTION AND IN OUR RISK FACTORS SET FORTH IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K AND IN OTHER REPORTS FILED WITH THE SEC BY THE COMPANY.\nThe following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of Altra Industrial Motion Corp. and its subsidiaries should be read together with the Selected Historical Financial Data, and the consolidated financial statements of Altra Industrial Motion Corp. and its subsidiaries and related notes included elsewhere in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion includes forward-looking statements. For a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results referred to in the forward-looking statements, see Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d. Unless the context requires otherwise, the terms Altra,\u201d Altra Industrial Motion Corp.,\u201d the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us\u201d and our\u201d refer to Altra Industrial Motion Corp. and its subsidiaries.\nGeneral\nWe are a leading global designer, producer and marketer of a wide range of electromechanical power transmission motion control ( PTMC\u201d) products. Our technologies are used in various motion related applications and across a wide variety of high-volume manufacturing and non-manufacturing processes in which reliability and precision are critical to avoid costly down time and enhance the overall efficiency of operations.\nWe market our products under well recognized and established brands, which have been in existence for an average of over 85 years. We serve a diversified group of customers comprised of over 1,000 direct original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs\u201d) including GE, Honeywell and Siemens, and also benefit from established, long-term relationships with leading industrial distributors, including Applied Industrial Technologies, Grainger, Kaman Corporation and Motion Industries. Many of our customers operate globally across a large number of industries, ranging from transportation, turf and agriculture, energy and mining to factory automation, medical and robotics. Our relationships with these customers often span multiple decades, which we believe reflects the high level of performance, quality and service we deliver, supplemented by the breadth of our offering, vast geographic footprint and our ability to rapidly develop custom solutions for complex customer requirements.\nOn October 1, 2018, Altra consummated the Fortive Transaction and acquired the A&S Business for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2,855.7 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments, which consisted of $1,400.0 million of cash and debt instruments transferred to Fortive and shares of Altra common stock received by Fortive shareholders valued at approximately $1,455.7 million. As of December 31, 2018, the initial accounting for the Fortive Transaction (including the allocation of the purchase price to acquired assets and liabilities) is not complete.\nBusiness Outlook\nOur future financial performance depends, in large part, on conditions in the markets that we serve and on the U.S., European, and global economies in general. Since completing the Fortive Transaction on October 1, 2018, our focus has been on the integration of the A&S Business and we have substantially completed the tactical components of that integration. In the quarter ended December 31, 2018, the addition of the A&S Business began to have a favorable impact on our financial performance. Looking forward, our strategic priorities are to continue to capitalize on our strong cash generation to de-lever our balance sheet while also implementing best practices from the Altra Business System to optimize sales growth and accelerate profitability, primarily through supply chain management, leveraging technology to drive innovation, and executing on organic growth and cross-selling opportunities.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on-going basis. Our estimates are based upon historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may vary from what our management anticipates and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results.\nWe believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in that they are important to the financial statements and they require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements.\nInventory. Inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The cost of inventory includes direct materials, direct labor, and production overhead. Market is defined as net realizable value. We state inventories acquired through acquisitions at their fair value at the date of acquisition based on the replacement cost of raw materials, the sales price of the finished goods less an appropriate amount representing the expected profitability from selling efforts, and, for work-in-process, the sales price of the finished goods less an appropriate amount representing the expected profitability from selling efforts and costs to complete.\nWe periodically review our quantities of inventories on hand and compare these amounts to the historical and expected usage of each particular product or product line. We record as a charge to cost of sales any amounts required to reduce the carrying value of inventories to net realizable value.\nBusiness Combinations. Business combinations are accounted for at fair value. Acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred and recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair value for assets and liabilities acquired. The fair value assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management's estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets\nGoodwill, Intangibles and other long-lived assets. In connection with our acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets were identified and recorded at fair value. We recorded intangible assets for customer relationships, trade names and trademarks, product technology, patents, in-process research and development ( IPR&D\u201d) and goodwill. In valuing the customer relationships, trade names and trademarks and product technology, we utilized variations of the income approach. The income approach was considered the most appropriate valuation technique because the inherent value of these assets is their ability to generate current and future income. The income approach relies on historical financial and qualitative information, as well as assumptions and estimates for projected financial information. Projected financial information is subject to risk if our estimates are incorrect. The most significant estimate relates to our projected revenues and profitability. If we do not meet the projected revenues and profitability used in the valuation calculations then the intangible assets could be impaired. In determining the value of customer relationships, we reviewed historical customer attrition rates which were determined to be approximately 1% to 12% per year. Most of our customers tend to be long-term customers with very little turnover. While we do not typically have long-term contracts with customers, we have established long-term relationships with customers which make it difficult for competitors to displace us. Additionally, we assessed historical revenue growth within our industry and customers' industries in determining the value of customer relationships. The value of our customer relationships intangible asset could become impaired if future results differ significantly from any of the underlying assumptions. This could include a higher customer attrition rate or a change in industry trends such as the use of long-term contracts which we may not be able to obtain successfully. Customer relationships and product technology and patents are considered finite-lived assets, with estimated lives ranging from 7 years to 29 years. The estimated lives were determined by calculating the number of years necessary to obtain 95% of the value of the discounted cash flows of the respective intangible asset.\nGoodwill, trade names and trademarks and IPR&D are considered indefinite lived assets. Our trade names and trademarks identify us and differentiate us from competitors, and therefore competition does not limit the useful life of these assets. Additionally, we believe that our trade names and trademarks will continue to generate product sales for an indefinite period.\nAccounting standards require that an annual goodwill impairment assessment be conducted at the reporting unit level using either a quantitative or qualitative approach. The Company has determined that its Power Transmission Technologies ( PTT\u201d) reporting segment is comprised of five reporting units. The Company has also determined that its A&S Business reporting segment is comprised of four reporting units.\nAs part of the annual goodwill impairment assessment we performed a quantitative assessment and estimated the fair value of each of our five reporting units in the PTT segment using an income approach. We forecasted future cash flows by reporting unit for each of the next five years and applied a long-term growth rate to the final year of forecasted cash flows. The cash flows were then discounted using our estimated discount rate. The forecasts of revenue and profitability growth for use in the long-range plan and the discount rate were the key assumptions in our goodwill fair value analysis. Our annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2018 indicated that in all instances, the fair values of our operating units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge. Given the excess fair value, we believe that a significant change in key valuation assumptions, including a decrease in revenues or profitability, or an increase in the discount rate, would not result in an indication of impairment.\nBecause of the timing of the A&S acquisition and due to the fact that purchase accounting is not complete, we have performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether the fair value of the A&S reporting units are more likely than not less than the carrying value (\"Step 0\"). Based on the assessment, the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair values of the A&S reporting units were greater than the respective carrying amount, and as a result, did not proceed to further impairment testing.\nManagement believes the preparation of revenue and profitability growth rates for use in the long-range plan and the discount rate requires significant use of judgment. If any of our reporting units do not meet our forecasted revenue and/or profitability estimates, we could be required to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis in future periods. In addition, if our discount rate increases, we could be required to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis.\nFor our indefinite lived intangible assets, mainly trademarks, we estimate the fair value by first estimating the total revenue attributable to the trademarks. Second, we estimate an appropriate royalty rate using the return on assets method by estimating the required financial return on our assets, excluding trademarks, less the overall return generated by our total asset base. The return as a percentage of revenue provides an indication of our royalty rate. We compared the estimated fair value of the trademarks with the carrying value of the trademarks and did not identify any impairment as of December 31, 2018.\nLong-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recovered. Long-lived assets are considered to be impaired if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset over its remaining useful life. If an asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value, and is charged to results of operations at that time.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nSee the discussion of critical accounting policies in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nResults of

We do not expect to incur any additional material costs as a result of the 2015 Altra Plan. We took restructuring actions under the 2015 Altra Plan that realized approximate annual savings of $0.7 million and $3.0 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. We estimate future annual savings for 2019 to be approximately $0.1 million. The cost savings through 2018 were recognized as improvements in SG&A and Cost of Sales of approximately $2.0 million and $5.4 million, respectively. The estimated future savings through 2019 are expected to improve SG&A and Cost of Sales by $0.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively. The total 2015 Plan savings are in line with our expectations.\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2017, the we commenced a new restructuring plan ( 2017 Altra Plan\u201d) as a result of the Stromag acquisition and to rationalize its global renewable energy business.

We expect to incur approximately $1.0 to $3.0 million in additional expense through 2019 related to the 2017 Altra Plan. We have achieved annual savings of $1.4 million during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 under the 2017 Altra Plan and estimates additional future savings during 2019 to be approximately $2.3 million. The cost savings for the year ended December 31, 2018 were recognized as improvements in SG&A and Cost of Sales of approximately $0.4 million and $0.7 million, respectively.

We expect that our primary ongoing requirements for cash will be for working capital, debt service, capital expenditures, acquisitions, pensions, dividends and share repurchases.\nOn October 1, 2018, we consummated the Fortive Transaction. The aggregate purchase price for the A&S Business was approximately $2,855.7 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments, and consisted of (i) $1,400.0 million of cash transferred to Fortive and (ii) shares of Altra common stock received by Fortive shareholders valued at approximately $1,455.7 million. The value of the common stock was based on the closing stock price on the A&S Closing Date of $41.59. We financed the cash portion of the Fortive Transaction with the Altra Credit Facilities (as defined herein).\nWe believe, based on current and projected levels of cash flows from operating activities, together with our ability to borrow under the Altra Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein), we have sufficient liquidity to meet our short-term and long-term needs to make required payments of interest on our debt, make amortization payments under the Altra Credit Facilities (as defined herein), fund our operating needs, fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements and comply with the financial ratios in our debt agreements. In the event additional funds are needed for operations, we could attempt to obtain new debt and/or refinance existing debt, or attempt to raise capital in the equity markets. There can be no assurance however that additional debt or equity financing will be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.\nNotes\nOn September 26, 2018, Stevens Holding Company, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ( Stevens Holding\u201d), announced the pricing of $400 million aggregate principal amount of Stevens Holding's 6.125% senior notes due 2026 (the Notes\u201d) in a private debt offering pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Private Placement\u201d). On October 1, 2018, the Private Placement closed, and Stevens Holding sold $150 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes (the Primary Notes\u201d) and an unaffiliated selling securityholder sold $250 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes (the Selling Securityholder Notes\u201d). The Notes will mature on October 1, 2026. Interest on the Notes accrues from October 1, 2018, and the first interest payment date on the Notes will be April 1, 2019. The Notes may be redeemed at the option of Stevens Holding on or after October 1, 2023, in the manner and at the redemption prices specified in the indenture governing the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. The Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Altra and certain of its domestic subsidiaries.\nThe unaffiliated selling securityholder received the Selling Securityholder Notes from Fortive prior to the closing of the Private Placement in exchange for certain outstanding Fortive debt held or acquired by the unaffiliated selling securityholder. Stevens Holding used the net proceeds of the Primary Notes to fund a dividend payment to Fortive prior to the consummation of the Merger, and Stevens Holding did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the Selling Securityholder Notes.\nAltra Credit Agreement\nOn the A&S Closing Date, Altra entered into a new Credit Agreement (the Altra Credit Agreement\u201d) with certain subsidiaries of Altra, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent, and a syndicate of lenders. The Altra Credit Agreement provides for a seven-year senior secured term loan to Altra in an aggregate principal amount of $1,340.0 million (the Altra Term Loan Facility\u201d) and a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility provided to Altra and certain of its subsidiaries in an aggregate committed principal amount of $300.0 million (the Altra Revolving Credit Facility\u201d and together with the Altra Term Loan Facility, the Altra Credit Facilities\u201d). The proceeds of the Altra Term Loan Facility were used to (i) consummate the Direct Sales, (ii) repay in full and extinguish all outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money under the 2015 Credit Agreement and (iii) pay certain fees, costs, and expenses in connection with the consummation of the Fortive Transaction. Any proceeds of the Altra Term Loan Facility not so used may be used for general corporate purposes. The proceeds of the Altra Revolving Credit Facility will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nThe Altra Credit Facilities are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by Altra and by each direct or indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiary of Altra, subject to certain customary exceptions.\nBorrowings under the Altra Term Loan Facility will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to a Eurocurrency Rate\u201d plus 2.00%, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate borrowings, or equal to a Base Rate\u201d plus 1.00%, in the case of Base Rate borrowings. Borrowings under the Altra Revolving Credit Facility will initially bear interest at a per annum rate equal to a Eurocurrency Rate plus 2.00%, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate borrowings, or equal to a Base Rate plus 1.00%, in the case of Base Rate borrowings, and thereafter will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to a Eurocurrency Rate or Base Rate, as applicable, plus an interest rate spread determined by reference to a pricing grid based on Altra's senior secured net leverage ratio. In addition, Altra will be required to pay fees that will fluctuate between 0.250% per annum to 0.375% per annum on the unused amount of the Altra Revolving Credit Facility, based upon Altra's senior secured net leverage ratio. The interest rate on the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility was 4.52% at December 31, 2018.\nRevolving borrowings and issuances of letters of credit under the Altra Revolving Credit Facility are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including the accuracy of representations and warranties and the absence of defaults.\nThe Altra Credit Agreement contains usual and customary representations and warranties, and usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on liens, investments, restricted payments, additional indebtedness and asset sales and mergers. In addition, the Altra Credit Agreement requires that Altra maintain a specified maximum senior secured leverage ratio and a specified minimum interest coverage ratio. The obligations of the borrowers of the Altra Credit Facilities under the Altra Credit Agreement may be accelerated upon customary events of default, including non-payment of principal, interest, fees and other amounts, inaccuracy of representation and warranties, violation of covenants, cross default and cross acceleration, voluntary and involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, inability to pay debts as they become due, material judgements, ERISA events, actual or asserted invalidity of security documents or guarantees and change in control.\n2015 Credit Agreement\nOn October 22, 2015, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by and among the Company, Altra Industrial Motion Netherlands, B.V., one of the Company's foreign subsidiaries (collectively with the Company, the Borrowers\u201d), the lenders party to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement from time to time (collectively, the Lenders\u201d), J.P, Morgan Securities LLC, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, and KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc., as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the Administrative Agent\u201d), to be guaranteed and secured by certain domestic subsidiaries of the Company, and which may be amended from time to time (the 2015 Credit Agreement\u201d).\nUnder the 2015 Credit Agreement, the amount of the Company's revolving credit facility was $350 million (the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). Prior to October 2018, the amounts available under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility were used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, and to repay existing indebtedness.\nPrior to October 2018, the amounts available under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility could be drawn upon in accordance with the terms of the 2015 Credit Agreement. All amounts outstanding under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility were due on the stated maturity or such earlier time, if any, required under the 2015 Credit Agreement. The amounts owed under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility could be prepaid at any time, subject to usual notification and breakage payment provisions. Interest on the amounts outstanding under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility was calculated using either an ABR Rate or Eurodollar Rate, plus the applicable margin. A portion of the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility could also be used for the issuance of letters of credit, and a portion of the amount of the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility was available for borrowings in certain agreed upon foreign currencies.\nThe 2015 Credit Agreement contained various affirmative and negative covenants and restrictions, which among other things, required the Borrowers to provide certain financial reports to the Lenders, required the Company to maintain certain financial covenants relating to consolidated leverage and interest coverage, limited maximum annual capital expenditures, and limited the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other equity distributions, purchase or redeem capital stock or debt, make certain investments, sell assets, engage in certain transactions, and effect a consolidation or merger. The 2015 Credit Agreement also contained customary events of default.\nOn October 21, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to amend the 2015 Credit Agreement (the October 2016 Amendment\u201d). The October 2016 Amendment, which became effective upon the December 30, 2016 closing of Altra's purchase of Stromag (the Stromag Acquisition\u201d), increased the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility by $75 million to $425 million. The Company borrowed additional funds under the increased 2015 Revolving Credit Facility to finance the Stromag Acquisition. The October 2016 Amendment also reset the possible expansion of up to $150 million of additional future loan commitments. In addition, the October 2016 Amendment increased the multicurrency sublimit to $250 million and adjusted certain financial covenants.\nOn October 1, 2018, in connection with the Fortive Transaction and the entering into the Altra Credit Agreement, the 2015 Credit Agreement was terminated and all outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money thereunder was repaid in full.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nIn March 2011, the Company issued convertible senior notes (the Convertible Notes\u201d) due March 1, 2031. The Convertible Notes were guaranteed by the Company's U.S. domestic subsidiaries. Interest on the Convertible Notes was payable semi-annually in arrears, on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing on September 1, 2011 at an annual rate of 2.75%. Proceeds from the Convertible Notes offering were $81.3 million, net of fees and expenses that were capitalized.\nOn December 12, 2016, the Company gave notice to The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., the Trustee under the Indenture governing the Convertible Notes (the Indenture\u201d) of its intention to redeem all of the Convertible Notes outstanding on January 12, 2017 (the Redemption Date\u201d), pursuant to the optional redemption provisions in the Indenture. The redemption price for the Convertible Notes was 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the Redemption Date plus a Make-Whole Premium equal to the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of interest on any Convertible Notes through March 1, 2018 (excluding interest accrued to, but excluding, the Redemption Date). In lieu of receiving the redemption price, holders of the Notes could surrender their Convertible Notes for conversion at any time before January 9, 2017. The conversion rate of the Convertible Notes was 39.0809 shares of the Company's common stock for each $1,000 of outstanding principal of the Convertible Notes. As of December 31, 2016, Convertible Notes with an outstanding principal amount of approximately $39.3 million were converted, resulting in the issuance of approximately 1.5 million shares of the Company's common stock. As a result of the conversion, the Company incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $1.9 million and the carrying value of the remaining Convertible Notes was $42.9 million net of unamortized discount as of December 31, 2016. In January 2017, additional Convertible Notes with an outstanding principal amount of approximately $44.7 million were converted resulting in the issuance of 1.7 million shares of the Company's common stock, and $0.9 million of Convertible Notes were redeemed for cash. The Company incurred an additional loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $1.8 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2017. All Convertible Notes were converted or redeemed as of January 12, 2017.\nBorrowings\nBelow is a summary of borrowings as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively:\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amounts in millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Term loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,320.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 262.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 400.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgages and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,734.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 275.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBelow is a reconciliation of net debt for the year ended December 31, 2018:\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amounts in millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,734.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 275.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (169.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (51.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe following is a summary of our cash balances and cash flows (in thousands) as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 51,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 69,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (17,124\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 116,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 80,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows provided by (used in) in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (989,379\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (26,722\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (962,657\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 986,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (74,048\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,060,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash\nequivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 168,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 51,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 116,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows for 2018\nFunds provided by operating activities totaled approximately $116.3 million for fiscal 2018, a significant portion of which resulted from cash provided by net income of $35.3 million. In addition, the net impact of the add-back of certain non-cash items including depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, loss on disposal of fixed assets, loss on settlement of partial pension plan, deferred financing costs, accretion of debt discount, benefit for deferred taxes, amortization of inventory fair value adjustment, and non-cash gain on foreign currency was approximately $79.2 million. Also, a net increase in current assets and liabilities provided cash of approximately $1.8 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased approximately $962.7 million due to the acquisition of the A&S Business on October 1, 2018 for $949.2 million, net of cash received.\nNet cash used in financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year to date period ended December 31, 2017 increased by $1,060.3 million. In 2018, cash from financing activities was driven by the borrowing of $1,340.0 million under the Altra Term Loan Facility, offset by payments of $281.6 million for the termination of the 2015 Credit Facility. In 2017, we used our cash to pay down approximately $51.6 million of debt.\nWe intend to use our remaining cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operations to provide for our working capital needs, to fund potential future acquisitions, to service our debt, including principal payments, for capital expenditures, for pension funding, for share repurchases and to pay dividends to our stockholders. As of December 31, 2018, we have approximately $87.2 million of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating and investing cash needs. Furthermore, the existing cash balances and the availability of additional borrowings under our Altra Credit Facilities provide additional potential sources of liquidity should they be required.\nCash Flows for 2017\nAmounts in thousands, except percentage data\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 69,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows from operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 80,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 76,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows from investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (26,722\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (206,908\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 180,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows from financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (74,048\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 149,772\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (223,820\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (707\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,772\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 51,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 69,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (17,124\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFunds provided by operating activities totaled approximately $80.6 million for fiscal 2017, a significant portion of which resulted from cash provided by net income of $51.4 million. In addition, the net impact of the add-back of certain non-cash items including depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, loss on disposal of fixed assets, loss on impairment of intangibles, loss on extinguishment of debt, loss on settlement of partial pension plan, deferred financing costs, provision for deferred taxes, amortization of inventory fair value adjustment, and non-cash gain on foreign currency was approximately $40.7 million. This was partially offset by a net increase in current assets and liabilities of approximately $11.5 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased approximately $180.2 million due to the acquisition of Stromag in December 2016 for $188.0 million, net of cash received.\nNet cash used in financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year to date period ended December 31, 2016 decreased $223.8 million. In December 2016 we borrowed approximately $200 million under our 2015 Revolving Credit Facility for the Stromag Acquisition. In 2017, we used our cash to pay down approximately $51.6 million of debt.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $44.9 million of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries that were subject to the Transition Toll Tax under the 2017 Tax Act, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe made capital expenditures of approximately $37.5 million and $32.8 million in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures during 2018 was due to the addition of the A&S Business. These capital expenditures will support on-going business needs. In 2019, we forecast capital expenditures to be in the range of $60.0 million to $65.0 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that provide liquidity, capital resources, market or credit risk support that expose us to any liability that is not reflected in our consolidated financial statements.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following

However, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities.\nStock-based Compensation\nThe 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the 2014 Plan\u201d) was approved by the Company's stockholders at its 2014 annual meeting. The 2014 Plan provides for various forms of stock based compensation to our directors, executive personnel and other key employees and consultants. Under the 2014 Plan, the total number of shares of common stock available for delivery pursuant to the grant of awards ( Awards\u201d) was originally 750,000. Shares of our common stock subject to Awards or grants awarded under our prior 2004 Equity Incentive Plan and outstanding as of the effective date of the 2014 Plan (except for substitute awards) that terminate without being exercised, expire, are forfeited or canceled, are exchanged for Awards that did not involve shares of common stock, are not issued on the stock settlement of a stock appreciation right, are withheld by the Company or tendered by a participant (either actually or by attestation) to pay an option exercise price or to pay the withholding tax on any Award, or are settled in cash in lieu of shares will again be available for Awards under the 2014 Plan. An amendment to the 2014 Plan to, among other things, make an additional 2,200,000 shares of common stock available for grant under the 2014 Plan was approved by the Company's stockholders at the special meeting of stockholders on September 4, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2018, there were 823,573 shares of unvested restricted stock outstanding under the 2014 Plan. The remaining compensation cost to be recognized through 2021 is $21.4 million. Based on the stock price at December 31, 2018, of $25.15 per share, the intrinsic value of these awards as of December 31, 2018, was $20.7 million.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions throughout the world. Our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors, such as the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions, the tax rates in such jurisdictions, tax treaties between jurisdictions, the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions and repatriate income, and changes in law. Generally, the tax liability for each legal entity is determined either (a) on a non-consolidated and non-combined basis or (b) on a consolidated and combined basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction, in either case without regard to the taxable losses of non-consolidated and non-combined affiliated entities. As a result, we may pay income taxes to some jurisdictions even though on an overall basis we incur a net loss for the period.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the U.S. Tax Act\u201d) was signed into law, making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a U.S. federal corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. We have calculated the impact of the U.S. Tax Act in our year end income tax provision in accordance with guidance available as of the date of this filing. The one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings was $7.4 million. In addition, we recognized a benefit totaling $7.8 million upon the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities from 35% to 21%.\nSeasonality\nGeneral economic conditions impact our business and financial results, and certain of our businesses experience seasonal and other trends related to the industries and end markets that they serve. For example, sales to OEMs are often stronger immediately preceding and following the launch of new products. In addition, we experience seasonality in our turf and garden business. As our large OEM customers prepare for the spring season, our shipments generally start increasing in December, peak in February and March, and begin to decline in April and May. This allows our customers to have inventory in place for the peak consumer purchasing periods for turf and garden products. The June-through-November period is typically the low season for us and our customers in the turf and garden market. Seasonality is also affected by weather and the level of housing starts. However, as a whole, we are not subject to material seasonality.\nInflation\nInflation can affect the costs of goods and services we use. The majority of the countries that are of significance to us, from either a manufacturing or sales viewpoint, have in recent years enjoyed relatively low inflation although there can be no assurance that inflation will not increase in future periods. The competitive environment in which we operate inevitably creates pressure on us to provide our customers with cost-effective products and services.\nTable 186: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "Net Sales. The increase in net sales during the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily due to increased sales resulting from the acquisition of the A&S Business in the amount of $241.7 million. Excluding the impact of A&S sales, net sales increased $56.9 million compared to the prior year. Changes in foreign exchange had a favorable impact on net sales of $14.6 million compared to the prior year, primarily driven by the Euro. Price also had a favorable impact during the year of $10.9 million. The remainder of the increase is due to higher sales as a result of increased volumes arising from the improvement in certain end-markets.\nSeasonality\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td> Amounts in thousands, except percentage data\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 876,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 708,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 167,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 the accuracy of estimated forecasts of OEM customers and the impact of the current global and European economic environment on our customers; \nAmounts in thousands, except percentage data\nStock-based Compensation\nWe market our products under well recognized and established brands, which have been in existence for an average of over 85 years.

Many of our customers operate globally across a large number of industries, ranging from transportation, turf and agriculture, energy and mining to factory automation, medical and robotics. Our relationships with these customers often span multiple decades, which we believe reflects the high level of performance, quality and service we deliver, supplemented by the breadth of our offering, vast geographic footprint and our ability to rapidly develop custom solutions for complex customer requirements.\nWe periodically review our quantities of inventories on hand and compare these amounts to the historical and expected usage of each particular product or product line.

</tr>\n</table>\nGeneral economic conditions impact our business and financial results, and certain of our businesses experience seasonal and other trends related to the industries and end markets that they serve. For example, sales to OEMs are often stronger immediately preceding and following the launch of new products. In addition, we experience seasonality in our turf and garden business. As our large OEM customers prepare for the spring season, our shipments generally start increasing in December, peak in February and March, and begin to decline in April and May. This allows our customers to have inventory in place for the peak consumer purchasing periods for turf and garden products. The June-through-November period is typically the low season for us and our customers in the turf and garden market. Seasonality is also affected by weather and the level of housing starts. However, as a whole, we are not subject to material seasonality.\nGoodwill, Intangibles and other long-lived assets. In connection with our acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets were identified and recorded at fair value. We recorded intangible assets for customer relationships, trade names and trademarks, product technology, patents, in-process research and development ( IPR&D\u201d) and goodwill. In valuing the customer relationships, trade names and trademarks and product technology, we utilized variations of the income approach. The income approach was considered the most appropriate valuation technique because the inherent value of these assets is their ability to generate current and future income. The income approach relies on historical financial and qualitative information, as well as assumptions and estimates for projected financial information. Projected financial information is subject to risk if our estimates are incorrect. The most significant estimate relates to our projected revenues and profitability. If we do not meet the projected revenues and profitability used in the valuation calculations then the intangible assets could be impaired. In determining the value of customer relationships, we reviewed historical customer attrition rates which were determined to be approximately 1% to 12% per year. Most of our customers tend to be long-term customers with very little turnover. While we do not typically have long-term contracts with customers, we have established long-term relationships with customers which make it difficult for competitors to displace us. Additionally, we assessed historical revenue growth within our industry and customers' industries in determining the value of customer relationships. The value of our customer relationships intangible asset could become impaired if future results differ significantly from any of the underlying assumptions. This could include a higher customer attrition rate or a change in industry trends such as the use of long-term contracts which we may not be able to obtain successfully. Customer relationships and product technology and patents are considered finite-lived assets, with estimated lives ranging from 7 years to 29 years. The estimated lives were determined by calculating the number of years necessary to obtain 95% of the value of the discounted cash flows of the respective intangible asset.\nTable 157: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,175,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 876,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 708,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 799,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 600,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 486,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 376,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 275,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 222,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 251,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 164,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 140,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,568\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 86,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 82,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on partial settlement of pension plan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other non-operating (income) expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 71,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 35,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 51,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n o the impact on our internal controls and compliance with the regulatory requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;

The provision for income tax during the year ended December 31, 2017 was higher than that of 2016 due to increased income in 2017 in higher tax rate jurisdictions. During 2016 there was an impairment of intangibles in the United States and a loss on the extinguishment of debt which resulted in lower taxable income in the Company's' highest tax rate jurisdiction which impacted the effective tax rate. The provision for income taxes for 2017 reflected an increase in the tax provision of $7.4 million based on the recognition of a provisional U.S. tax charge for the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings as a result of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act which was offset by the benefit of $7.8 million derived from the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities.\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td> Amounts in thousands, except percentage data\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,175,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 876,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 298,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPower Transmission Technologies\nSegment Performance\nAmounts in thousands, except percentage data\n \u2022 the Company's ability to successfully pursue the Company's development activities and successfully integrate new operations and systems, including the realization of revenues, economies of scale, cost savings, and productivity gains associated with such operations; \n\n \u2022 the outcome of litigation to which the Company is a party from time to time, including product liability claims; \nGross profit. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased slightly during the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to the acquisition of the A&S Business. This increase was partially offset by the impact of amortization of acquired inventory related to the A&S acquisition in the amount of $14.2 million recorded at fair value rather than cost. Absent this fair value adjustment, the gross profit as a percent of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 would have been 33.2%.\n \u2022 changes in market conditions in which we operate that would influence the value of the Company's stock; \n \u2022 the risks associated with the Company's exposure to renewable energy markets; \nNet cash used in financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year to date period ended December 31, 2017 increased by $1,060.3 million. In 2018, cash from financing activities was driven by the borrowing of $1,340.0 million under the Altra Term Loan Facility, offset by payments of $281.6 million for the termination of the 2015 Credit Facility. In 2017, we used our cash to pay down approximately $51.6 million of debt.\nThe Altra Credit Facilities are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by Altra and by each direct or indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiary of Altra, subject to certain customary exceptions.\n\nAutomation & Specialty\n \u2022 the risks associated with transitioning from LIBOR to a replacement alternative reference rate; \nProvision for income taxes. The provision for income tax as a percentage of income before income taxes during the year ended December 31, 2018 was higher than that of 2017 due to non-deductible acquisition related costs coupled with GILTI tax as a result of the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act in the United States. The provision for income taxes for 2017 reflected an increase in the tax provision of $7.4 million based on the recognition of a provisional U.S. tax charge for the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings as a result of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act which was offset by a benefit of $7.8 million derived from the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities. Going forward the Company expects its consolidated tax rate to be approximately 25% to 27%.\nThe unaffiliated selling securityholder received the Selling Securityholder Notes from Fortive prior to the closing of the Private Placement in exchange for certain outstanding Fortive debt held or acquired by the unaffiliated selling securityholder. Stevens Holding used the net proceeds of the Primary Notes to fund a dividend payment to Fortive prior to the consummation of the Merger, and Stevens Holding did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the Selling Securityholder Notes.\n o possible inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, policies and compensation structures; \nBecause of the timing of the A&S acquisition and due to the fact that purchase accounting is not complete, we have performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether the fair value of the A&S reporting units are more likely than not less than the carrying value (\"Step 0\"). Based on the assessment, the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair values of the A&S reporting units were greater than the respective carrying amount, and as a result, did not proceed to further impairment testing.\nWe made capital expenditures of approximately $37.5 million and $32.8 million in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures during 2018 was due to the addition of the A&S Business. These capital expenditures will support on-going business needs. In 2019, we forecast capital expenditures to be in the range of $60.0 million to $65.0 million.\nOn December 12, 2016, the Company gave notice to The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., the Trustee under the Indenture governing the Convertible Notes (the Indenture\u201d) of its intention to redeem all of the Convertible Notes outstanding on January 12, 2017 (the Redemption Date\u201d), pursuant to the optional redemption provisions in the Indenture. The redemption price for the Convertible Notes was 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the Redemption Date plus a Make-Whole Premium equal to the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of interest on any Convertible Notes through March 1, 2018 (excluding interest accrued to, but excluding, the Redemption Date). In lieu of receiving the redemption price, holders of the Notes could surrender their Convertible Notes for conversion at any time before January 9, 2017. The conversion rate of the Convertible Notes was 39.0809 shares of the Company's common stock for each $1,000 of outstanding principal of the Convertible Notes. As of December 31, 2016, Convertible Notes with an outstanding principal amount of approximately $39.3 million were converted, resulting in the issuance of approximately 1.5 million shares of the Company's common stock. As a result of the conversion, the Company incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $1.9 million and the carrying value of the remaining Convertible Notes was $42.9 million net of unamortized discount as of December 31, 2016. In January 2017, additional Convertible Notes with an outstanding principal amount of approximately $44.7 million were converted resulting in the issuance of 1.7 million shares of the Company's common stock, and $0.9 million of Convertible Notes were redeemed for cash. The Company incurred an additional loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $1.8 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2017. All Convertible Notes were converted or redeemed as of January 12, 2017.\nPower Transmission Technologies.\n (1) A foreign subsidiary of the Company entered into a mortgage with a bank for \u20ac1.5 million, or $1.7 million, secured by its facility in Heidelberg, Germany to replace its previously existing mortgage during the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The mortgage has an interest rate of 1.79% which is payable in monthly installments through August 2023. The mortgage has a remaining principal balance of \u20ac0.9, or $1.0, at December 31, 2018. \n\nInflation\n\n \u2022 the effects of intense competition in the markets in which we operate; \n</table>\n \u2022 the Company's ability to retain existing customers and our ability to attract new customers for growth of our business; \nInflation can affect the costs of goods and services we use. The majority of the countries that are of significance to us, from either a manufacturing or sales viewpoint, have in recent years enjoyed relatively low inflation although there can be no assurance that inflation will not increase in future periods. The competitive environment in which we operate inevitably creates pressure on us to provide our customers with cost-effective products and services.\nAltra Credit Agreement\n\n (5) We have up to $300.0 million of total borrowing capacity, through October 1, 2025, under the Altra Revolving Credit Facility of which $295.8 million is currently available. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were $4.2 million and $3.5 million of outstanding letters of credit under the Altra Revolving Credit Facility and the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility. We have variable monthly and/or quarterly cash interest requirements due on the Altra Revolving Credit Facility through October 2025, which are not included in the above table. \n \u2022 changes in volatility of the Company's stock price and the risk of litigation following a decline in the price of the Company's stock; \nThe following is a summary of our cash balances and cash flows (in thousands) as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n \u2022 the risks associated with the Company's exposure to variable interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; \nCapital Expenditures\n \u2022 political and economic conditions globally, nationally, regionally, and in the markets in which we operate; \nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAs part of the annual goodwill impairment assessment we performed a quantitative assessment and estimated the fair value of each of our five reporting units in the PTT segment using an income approach. We forecasted future cash flows by reporting unit for each of the next five years and applied a long-term growth rate to the final year of forecasted cash flows. The cash flows were then discounted using our estimated discount rate. The forecasts of revenue and profitability growth for use in the long-range plan and the discount rate were the key assumptions in our goodwill fair value analysis. Our annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2018 indicated that in all instances, the fair values of our operating units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge. Given the excess fair value, we believe that a significant change in key valuation assumptions, including a decrease in revenues or profitability, or an increase in the discount rate, would not result in an indication of impairment.\nAccounting standards require that an annual goodwill impairment assessment be conducted at the reporting unit level using either a quantitative or qualitative approach. The Company has determined that its Power Transmission Technologies ( PTT\u201d) reporting segment is comprised of five reporting units. The Company has also determined that its A&S Business reporting segment is comprised of four reporting units.\n</td> </tr>\n \u2022 the risks associated with our debt; \nOther non-operating expense (income). Other non-operating expense (income) in each period in the chart above relates primarily to changes in foreign currency, primarily the Euro, British Pound, and Chinese Renminbi.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses increased due to the inclusion of R&D expenses for the A&S Business for the year ended December 31, 2018 in the amount of approximately $9.1 million. We expect research and development costs to approximate 2.0% - 3.0% of sales in future periods.\n\n\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2017, the Company commenced a new restructuring plan ( 2017 Altra Plan\u201d) as a result of the Stromag acquisition and to rationalize its global renewable energy business. The actions taken pursuant to the 2017 Altra Plan include reducing headcount, facility consolidations and the elimination of certain costs.\nBusiness Combinations. Business combinations are accounted for at fair value. Acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred and recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair value for assets and liabilities acquired. The fair value assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management's estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets\nThe Altra Credit Agreement contains usual and customary representations and warranties, and usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on liens, investments, restricted payments, additional indebtedness and asset sales and mergers. In addition, the Altra Credit Agreement requires that Altra maintain a specified maximum senior secured leverage ratio and a specified minimum interest coverage ratio. The obligations of the borrowers of the Altra Credit Facilities under the Altra Credit Agreement may be accelerated upon customary events of default, including non-payment of principal, interest, fees and other amounts, inaccuracy of representation and warranties, violation of covenants, cross default and cross acceleration, voluntary and involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, inability to pay debts as they become due, material judgements, ERISA events, actual or asserted invalidity of security documents or guarantees and change in control.\nOn October 1, 2018, Altra consummated the Fortive Transaction and acquired the A&S Business for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2,855.7 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments, which consisted of $1,400.0 million of cash and debt instruments transferred to Fortive and shares of Altra common stock received by Fortive shareholders valued at approximately $1,455.7 million. As of December 31, 2018, the initial accounting for the Fortive Transaction (including the allocation of the purchase price to acquired assets and liabilities) is not complete.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2016\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses increased due to the inclusion of Stromag for the year ended December 31, 2017. Research and development expenses remained consistent as a percentage of sales compared to the prior year.\nManagement believes the preparation of revenue and profitability growth rates for use in the long-range plan and the discount rate requires significant use of judgment. If any of our reporting units do not meet our forecasted revenue and/or profitability estimates, we could be required to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis in future periods. In addition, if our discount rate increases, we could be required to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis.\nOverview\nOn October 22, 2015, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by and among the Company, Altra Industrial Motion Netherlands, B.V., one of the Company's foreign subsidiaries (collectively with the Company, the Borrowers\u201d), the lenders party to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement from time to time (collectively, the Lenders\u201d), J.P, Morgan Securities LLC, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, and KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc., as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the Administrative Agent\u201d), to be guaranteed and secured by certain domestic subsidiaries of the Company, and which may be amended from time to time (the 2015 Credit Agreement\u201d).\nWe may be required to make cash outlays related to our unrecognized tax benefits. However, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2017, the we commenced a new restructuring plan ( 2017 Altra Plan\u201d) as a result of the Stromag acquisition and to rationalize its global renewable energy business. The actions taken pursuant to the 2017 Altra Plan include reducing headcount, facility consolidations and the elimination of certain costs. We expect to incur approximately $1.0 to $3.0 million in additional expense through 2019 related to the 2017 Altra Plan. We have achieved annual savings of $1.4 million during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 under the 2017 Altra Plan and estimates additional future savings during 2019 to be approximately $2.3 million. The cost savings for the year ended December 31, 2018 were recognized as improvements in SG&A and Cost of Sales of approximately $0.4 million and $0.7 million, respectively. The estimated future savings through 2019 are expected to improve SG&A and Cost of Sales by $0.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively. The total 2017 Altra Plan savings are in line with our expectations.\nSegment Performance.\nInterest expense. Interest expense decreased significantly during the period as a result of the conversion and redemption of our Convertible Notes, in December 2016 and January 2017, and the favorable impact of the cross-currency interest rate swaps despite the higher borrowing under our 2015 Revolving Credit Facility from the Stromag Acquisition.\n\nLong-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recovered. Long-lived assets are considered to be impaired if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset over its remaining useful life. If an asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value, and is charged to results of operations at that time.\n \u2022 the Company's ability to achieve its business plans, including with respect to an uncertain economic environment; \nWe believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in that they are important to the financial statements and they require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements.\n\n (2) A foreign subsidiary of the Company entered into a mortgage with a bank to borrow \u20ac6.0 million, or $6.7 million, for the expansion of its facility in Esslingen, Germany during August 2014. The mortgage has an interest rate of 2.5% per year which is payable in annual interest payments of \u20ac0.1 million or $0.1 million to be paid in monthly installments which are not included in the table above. The mortgage has a remaining principal balance of \u20ac6.0, or $6.9, at December 31, 2018. The principal portion of the mortgage will be due in a lump-sum payment in July 2028. \nSee the discussion of critical accounting policies in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRestructuring costs. During 2015 the Company adopted a restructuring plan ( 2015 Altra Plan\u201d) in response to weak demand in Europe and to make certain adjustments to improve business effectiveness, reduce the number of facilities and streamline the Company's cost structure. The actions taken pursuant to the 2015 Altra Plan included reducing headcount, facility consolidations and related asset impairments and limiting discretionary spending to improve profitability.\nContractual Obligations\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which reflect the Company's current estimates, expectations and projections about the Company's future results, performance, prospects and opportunities. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, the information concerning the Company's possible future results of operations including revenue, costs of goods sold, gross margin, future profitability, future economic improvement, business and growth strategies, financing plans, expected leverage levels, the Company's competitive position and the effects of competition, the projected growth of the industries in which we operate, and the Company's ability to consummate strategic acquisitions and other transactions. Forward-looking statements include statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by forward-looking words such as anticipate,\u201d believe,\u201d could,\u201d estimate,\u201d expect,\u201d intend,\u201d plan,\u201d may,\u201d should,\u201d will,\u201d would,\u201d project,\u201d forecast,\u201d and similar expressions or variations. These forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to the Company and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause the Company's actual results, performance, prospects, or opportunities to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from the results referred to in the forward-looking statements the Company makes in this report include:\nUnder the 2015 Credit Agreement, the amount of the Company's revolving credit facility was $350 million (the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). Prior to October 2018, the amounts available under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility were used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, and to repay existing indebtedness.\n \u2022 the cyclical nature of the markets in which we operate; \nRevolving borrowings and issuances of letters of credit under the Altra Revolving Credit Facility are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including the accuracy of representations and warranties and the absence of defaults.\nCash Flows for 2018\n o lost sales and customers as a result of customers of Altra or the A&S Business deciding not to do business with us; \nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that provide liquidity, capital resources, market or credit risk support that expose us to any liability that is not reflected in our consolidated financial statements.\n \u2022 the Company's ability to achieve the efficiencies, savings and other benefits anticipated from our cost reduction, margin improvement, restructuring, plant consolidation and other business optimization initiatives; \nGeneral\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. The vast majority of the increase in SG&A was due to the inclusion of SG&A related to the Stromag business. The decline of SG&A as a percentage of sales is primarily due to facility consolidation and restructuring activities.\nInterest expense. Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to the new debt instruments that the Company used to finance the acquisition of the A&S Business. We expect our interest expense in 2019 to increase as a result of additional borrowings to finance a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of the A&S Business.\nDuring 2019, the we commenced a restructuring plan ( 2019 Plan\u201d) to drive efficiencies, reduce the number of facilities and optimize our operating margin. We expect expenses related to workforce reductions, lease termination costs and other facility rationalization costs. We expect to incur $15 - $25 million in restructuring expenses under the 2019 Altra Plan over the next 4 years, primarily related to plant consolidation and headcount reductions.\nNet Sales. The increase in sales during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the acquisition of Stromag, price increases and higher sales levels in several end markets. Changes in foreign exchange rates also had a favorable impact on net sales of $2.0 million. Of the increase in sales, approximately $137.9 million related to the inclusion of additional sales as a result of the acquisition of Stromag. In addition, price increases contributed $6.2 million. The remainder of the increase related to a recovery in sales levels in various end markets in the Couplings, Clutches, and Brakes business segment.\n o risks associated with managing a larger and more complex business; \n \u2022 disruption of our supply chain; \n \u2022 the risks related to regulations regarding conflict minerals; \n \u2022 the effects of changes to critical accounting estimates; \n \u2022 the Company's risk of loss not covered by insurance; \n\n\nFunds provided by operating activities totaled approximately $80.6 million for fiscal 2017, a significant portion of which resulted from cash provided by net income of $51.4 million. In addition, the net impact of the add-back of certain non-cash items including depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, loss on disposal of fixed assets, loss on impairment of intangibles, loss on extinguishment of debt, loss on settlement of partial pension plan, deferred financing costs, provision for deferred taxes, amortization of inventory fair value adjustment, and non-cash gain on foreign currency was approximately $40.7 million. This was partially offset by a net increase in current assets and liabilities of approximately $11.5 million.\nRecent Accounting Standards\n\n2015 Credit Agreement\nOur future financial performance depends, in large part, on conditions in the markets that we serve and on the U.S., European, and global economies in general. Since completing the Fortive Transaction on October 1, 2018, our focus has been on the integration of the A&S Business and we have substantially completed the tactical components of that integration. In the quarter ended December 31, 2018, the addition of the A&S Business began to have a favorable impact on our financial performance. Looking forward, our strategic priorities are to continue to capitalize on our strong cash generation to de-lever our balance sheet while also implementing best practices from the Altra Business System to optimize sales growth and accelerate profitability, primarily through supply chain management, leveraging technology to drive innovation, and executing on organic growth and cross-selling opportunities.\nOn October 1, 2018, in connection with the Fortive Transaction and the entering into the Altra Credit Agreement, the 2015 Credit Agreement was terminated and all outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money thereunder was repaid in full.\n \u2022 changes in accounting rules and standards, audits, compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and regulatory investigations; \nBelow is a reconciliation of net debt for the year ended December 31, 2018:\n \u2022 the risks associated with the volatility and disruption in the global financial markets; \nNet cash used in financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year to date period ended December 31, 2016 decreased $223.8 million. In December 2016 we borrowed approximately $200 million under our 2015 Revolving Credit Facility for the Stromag Acquisition.

Our gross profit margin for the same period increased by 170 basis points from 30.7% to 32.3%. This increase of gross profit margin was partially offset by the impact of amortization of acquired inventory related to the A&S acquisition of $14.2 million recorded at fair value rather than cost. Absent this fair value adjustment, the gross profit margin for the three-month period ended December 31, 2018 would have been 35.4%, an increase of 470 basis points.\n\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $44.9 million of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries that were subject to the Transition Toll Tax under the 2017 Tax Act, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.\nBusiness Outlook\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2017\n o the loss of key employees; \nPrior to October 2018, the amounts available under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility could be drawn upon in accordance with the terms of the 2015 Credit Agreement. All amounts outstanding under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility were due on the stated maturity or such earlier time, if any, required under the 2015 Credit Agreement. The amounts owed under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility could be prepaid at any time, subject to usual notification and breakage payment provisions. Interest on the amounts outstanding under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility was calculated using either an ABR Rate or Eurodollar Rate, plus the applicable margin. A portion of the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility could also be used for the issuance of letters of credit, and a portion of the amount of the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility was available for borrowings in certain agreed upon foreign currencies.\nFunds provided by operating activities totaled approximately $116.3 million for fiscal 2018, a significant portion of which resulted from cash provided by net income of $35.3 million. In addition, the net impact of the add-back of certain non-cash items including depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, loss on disposal of fixed assets, loss on settlement of partial pension plan, deferred financing costs, accretion of debt discount, benefit for deferred taxes, amortization of inventory fair value adjustment, and non-cash gain on foreign currency was approximately $79.2 million.

Our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors, such as the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions, the tax rates in such jurisdictions, tax treaties between jurisdictions, the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions and repatriate income, and changes in law. Generally, the tax liability for each legal entity is determined either (a) on a non-consolidated and non-combined basis or (b) on a consolidated and combined basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction, in either case without regard to the taxable losses of non-consolidated and non-combined affiliated entities. As a result, we may pay income taxes to some jurisdictions even though on an overall basis we incur a net loss for the period.\nDATE OF THIS REPORT OR TO REFLECT THE OCCURRENCE OF UNANTICIPATED EVENTS.

Approximately $137.9 million of the increase was due to the inclusion of sales from the newly acquired Stromag business for the year. Segment operating income increased by approximately $35.2 million compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of the addition of Stromag. The remainder of the increase was due to a modest recovery in certain end markets.\n \u2022 the risks associated with international operations, including currency risks; \nIncome Taxes\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased approximately $180.2 million due to the acquisition of Stromag in December 2016 for $188.0 million, net of cash received.\n o unanticipated issues in integrating manufacturing, logistics, information, communications and other systems; \nCash Flows for 2017\n\nBorrowings under the Altra Term Loan Facility will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to a Eurocurrency Rate\u201d plus 2.00%, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate borrowings, or equal to a Base Rate\u201d plus 1.00%, in the case of Base Rate borrowings.

The aggregate purchase price for the A&S Business was approximately $2,855.7 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments, and consisted of (i) $1,400.0 million of cash transferred to Fortive and (ii) shares of Altra common stock received by Fortive shareholders valued at approximately $1,455.7 million. The value of the common stock was based on the closing stock price on the A&S Closing Date of $41.59. We financed the cash portion of the Fortive Transaction with the Altra Credit Facilities (as defined herein).\nGoodwill, trade names and trademarks and IPR&D are considered indefinite lived assets. Our trade names and trademarks identify us and differentiate us from competitors, and therefore competition does not limit the useful life of these assets. Additionally, we believe that our trade names and trademarks will continue to generate product sales for an indefinite period.\nInventory. Inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The cost of inventory includes direct materials, direct labor, and production overhead. Market is defined as net realizable value. We state inventories acquired through acquisitions at their fair value at the date of acquisition based on the replacement cost of raw materials, the sales price of the finished goods less an appropriate amount representing the expected profitability from selling efforts, and, for work-in-process, the sales price of the finished goods less an appropriate amount representing the expected profitability from selling efforts and costs to complete.\n\nThe 2015 Credit Agreement contained various affirmative and negative covenants and restrictions, which among other things, required the Borrowers to provide certain financial reports to the Lenders, required the Company to maintain certain financial covenants relating to consolidated leverage and interest coverage, limited maximum annual capital expenditures, and limited the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other equity distributions, purchase or redeem capital stock or debt, make certain investments, sell assets, engage in certain transactions, and effect a consolidation or merger. The 2015 Credit Agreement also contained customary events of default.\nFrom time to time, we may have cash funding requirements associated with our pension plans. As of December 31, 2018, there were no funding requirements for 2019 to 2023. These amounts are based on actuarial assumptions and actual amounts could be materially different.\nRestructuring costs. During 2015 the we adopted the 2015 Altra Plan in response to weak demand in Europe and to make certain adjustments to improve business effectiveness, reduce the number of facilities and streamline our cost structure. The actions taken pursuant to the 2015 Altra Plan included reducing headcount, facility consolidations and related asset impairments and limiting discretionary spending to improve profitability. We do not expect to incur any additional material costs as a result of the 2015 Altra Plan. We took restructuring actions under the 2015 Altra Plan that realized approximate annual savings of $0.7 million and $3.0 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. We estimate future annual savings for 2019 to be approximately $0.1 million. The cost savings through 2018 were recognized as improvements in SG&A and Cost of Sales of approximately $2.0 million and $5.4 million, respectively. The estimated future savings through 2019 are expected to improve SG&A and Cost of Sales by $0.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively. The total 2015 Plan savings are in line with our expectations.\n \u2022 the Company's access to capital, credit ratings, indebtedness, and ability to raise additional capital and operate under the terms of the Company's debt obligations; \nWe intend to use our remaining cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operations to provide for our working capital needs, to fund potential future acquisitions, to service our debt, including principal payments, for capital expenditures, for pension funding, for share repurchases and to pay dividends to our stockholders. As of December 31, 2018, we have approximately $87.2 million of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating and investing cash needs. Furthermore, the existing cash balances and the availability of additional borrowings under our Altra Credit Facilities provide additional potential sources of liquidity should they be required.\nBelow is a summary of borrowings as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively:\n \u2022 the effects of the loss or bankruptcy of or default by any significant customer, suppliers, or other entity relevant to the Company's operations; \nWe finance our capital and working capital requirements through a combination of cash flows from operating activities and borrowings under the Altra Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2018, we have the ability under the Altra Revolving Credit Facility to borrow an additional $295.8 million subject to satisfying customary conditions. We expect that our primary ongoing requirements for cash will be for working capital, debt service, capital expenditures, acquisitions, pensions, dividends and share repurchases.\nTable 186: <table> <tr> <td>\nThe following table is a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\n\n\n\n \u2022 other factors, risks, and uncertainties referenced in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Risk Factors\u201d set forth in this document. \n\nGross profit. Gross profit as a percentage of sales improved slightly during the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was due to improvements realized from our facility consolidations, price increases and improving end markets. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by the impact of acquired inventory related to the Stromag acquisition in the amount of $2.3 million which was recorded at fair value rather than cost. Absent this fair value adjustment the gross profit as a percent of sales for 2017 would have been 31.7%.\n \u2022 the Company's ability to implement and maintain its Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system; \n \u2022 the risks associated with and potential impacts of new trade policies, legislation, treaties, and tariffs both in and outside of the United States; \n (3) During 2016, a foreign subsidiary of the Company entered into a loan with a bank to equip its facility in Zlate Moravce, Slovakia.

The increase in net sales during the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily due to increased sales resulting from the acquisition of the A&S Business in the amount of $241.7 million. Excluding the impact of A&S sales, net sales increased $56.9 million compared to the prior year. Changes in foreign exchange had a favorable impact on net sales of $14.6 million compared to the prior year, primarily driven by the Euro. Price also had a favorable impact during the year of $10.9 million. The remainder of the increase is due to higher sales as a result of increased volumes arising from the improvement in certain end-markets.\nSeasonality\n \u2022 the accuracy of estimated forecasts of OEM customers and the impact of the current global and European economic environment on our customers; \nAmounts in thousands, except percentage data\nStock-based Compensation\nWe market our products under well recognized and established brands, which have been in existence for an average of over 85 years. We serve a diversified group of customers comprised of over 1,000 direct original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs\u201d) including GE, Honeywell and Siemens, and also benefit from established, long-term relationships with leading industrial distributors, including Applied Industrial Technologies, Grainger, Kaman Corporation and Motion Industries. Many of our customers operate globally across a large number of industries, ranging from transportation, turf and agriculture, energy and mining to factory automation, medical and robotics. Our relationships with these customers often span multiple decades, which we believe reflects the high level of performance, quality and service we deliver, supplemented by the breadth of our offering, vast geographic footprint and our ability to rapidly develop custom solutions for complex customer requirements.\nWe periodically review our quantities of inventories on hand and compare these amounts to the historical and expected usage of each particular product or product line.

The following discussion includes forward-looking statements. For a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results referred to in the forward-looking statements, see Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d.

Second, we estimate an appropriate royalty rate using the return on assets method by estimating the required financial return on our assets, excluding trademarks, less the overall return generated by our total asset base. The return as a percentage of revenue provides an indication of our royalty rate. We compared the estimated fair value of the trademarks with the carrying value of the trademarks and did not identify any impairment as of December 31, 2018.\nResults of Operations.\n \u2022 the risk associated with the UK vote to leave the European Union; and \n (6) We assumed $400 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Senior Notes due 2026, upon the closing of the Fortive Transaction.

For example, sales to OEMs are often stronger immediately preceding and following the launch of new products. In addition, we experience seasonality in our turf and garden business. As our large OEM customers prepare for the spring season, our shipments generally start increasing in December, peak in February and March, and begin to decline in April and May. This allows our customers to have inventory in place for the peak consumer purchasing periods for turf and garden products. The June-through-November period is typically the low season for us and our customers in the turf and garden market. Seasonality is also affected by weather and the level of housing starts. However, as a whole, we are not subject to material seasonality.\nGoodwill, Intangibles and other long-lived assets. In connection with our acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets were identified and recorded at fair value. We recorded intangible assets for customer relationships, trade names and trademarks, product technology, patents, in-process research and development ( IPR&D\u201d) and goodwill. In valuing the customer relationships, trade names and trademarks and product technology, we utilized variations of the income approach. The income approach was considered the most appropriate valuation technique because the inherent value of these assets is their ability to generate current and future income. The income approach relies on historical financial and qualitative information, as well as assumptions and estimates for projected financial information. Projected financial information is subject to risk if our estimates are incorrect. The most significant estimate relates to our projected revenues and profitability. If we do not meet the projected revenues and profitability used in the valuation calculations then the intangible assets could be impaired. In determining the value of customer relationships, we reviewed historical customer attrition rates which were determined to be approximately 1% to 12% per year. Most of our customers tend to be long-term customers with very little turnover. While we do not typically have long-term contracts with customers, we have established long-term relationships with customers which make it difficult for competitors to displace us. Additionally, we assessed historical revenue growth within our industry and customers' industries in determining the value of customer relationships. The value of our customer relationships intangible asset could become impaired if future results differ significantly from any of the underlying assumptions. This could include a higher customer attrition rate or a change in industry trends such as the use of long-term contracts which we may not be able to obtain successfully. Customer relationships and product technology and patents are considered finite-lived assets, with estimated lives ranging from 7 years to 29 years. The estimated lives were determined by calculating the number of years necessary to obtain 95% of the value of the discounted cash flows of the respective intangible asset.\n o the impact on our internal controls and compliance with the regulatory requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; and \nBorrowings\nWe believe, based on current and projected levels of cash flows from operating activities, together with our ability to borrow under the Altra Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein), we have sufficient liquidity to meet our short-term and long-term needs to make required payments of interest on our debt, make amortization payments under the Altra Credit Facilities (as defined herein), fund our operating needs, fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements and comply with the financial ratios in our debt agreements. In the event additional funds are needed for operations, we could attempt to obtain new debt and/or refinance existing debt, or attempt to raise capital in the equity markets. There can be no assurance however that additional debt or equity financing will be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the U.S. Tax Act\u201d) was signed into law, making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a U.S. federal corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. We have calculated the impact of the U.S. Tax Act in our year end income tax provision in accordance with guidance available as of the date of this filing. The one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings was $7.4 million. In addition, we recognized a benefit totaling $7.8 million upon the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities from 35% to 21%.\nOn September 26, 2018, Stevens Holding Company, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ( Stevens Holding\u201d), announced the pricing of $400 million aggregate principal amount of Stevens Holding's 6.125% senior notes due 2026 (the Notes\u201d) in a private debt offering pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Private Placement\u201d). On October 1, 2018, the Private Placement closed, and Stevens Holding sold $150 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes (the Primary Notes\u201d) and an unaffiliated selling securityholder sold $250 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes (the Selling Securityholder Notes\u201d). The Notes will mature on October 1, 2026. Interest on the Notes accrues from October 1, 2018, and the first interest payment date on the Notes will be April 1, 2019. The Notes may be redeemed at the option of Stevens Holding on or after October 1, 2023, in the manner and at the redemption prices specified in the indenture governing the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. The Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Altra and certain of its domestic subsidiaries.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased approximately $962.7 million due to the acquisition of the A&S Business on October 1, 2018 for $949.2 million, net of cash received.\nThe 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the 2014 Plan\u201d) was approved by the Company's stockholders at its 2014 annual meeting. The 2014 Plan provides for various forms of stock based compensation to our directors, executive personnel and other key employees and consultants. Under the 2014 Plan, the total number of shares of common stock available for delivery pursuant to the grant of awards ( Awards\u201d) was originally 750,000. Shares of our common stock subject to Awards or grants awarded under our prior 2004 Equity Incentive Plan and outstanding as of the effective date of the 2014 Plan (except for substitute awards) that terminate without being exercised, expire, are forfeited or canceled, are exchanged for Awards that did not involve shares of common stock, are not issued on the stock settlement of a stock appreciation right, are withheld by the Company or tendered by a participant (either actually or by attestation) to pay an option exercise price or to pay the withholding tax on any Award, or are settled in cash in lieu of shares will again be available for Awards under the 2014 Plan. An amendment to the 2014 Plan to, among other things, make an additional 2,200,000 shares of common stock available for grant under the 2014 Plan was approved by the Company's stockholders at the special meeting of stockholders on September 4, 2018.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2018, SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to costs associated with the acquisition of the A&S Business. The increase was partially driven by the inclusion of $47.2 million of SG&A related to the A&S Business including $15.6 million of amortization expense. In addition, the Company incurred approximately $36.2 million in acquisition related expenses and also recorded additional stock compensation expense of $2.8 million.\nOn October 21, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to amend the 2015 Credit Agreement (the October 2016 Amendment\u201d). The October 2016 Amendment, which became effective upon the December 30, 2016 closing of Altra's purchase of Stromag (the Stromag Acquisition\u201d), increased the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility by $75 million to $425 million. The Company borrowed additional funds under the increased 2015 Revolving Credit Facility to finance the Stromag Acquisition. The October 2016 Amendment also reset the possible expansion of up to $150 million of additional future loan commitments. In addition, the October 2016 Amendment increased the multicurrency sublimit to $250 million and adjusted certain financial covenants.\nNotes\nConvertible Senior Notes\nOn the A&S Closing Date, Altra entered into a new Credit Agreement (the Altra Credit Agreement\u201d) with certain subsidiaries of Altra, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent, and a syndicate of lenders. The Altra Credit Agreement provides for a seven-year senior secured term loan to Altra in an aggregate principal amount of $1,340.0 million (the Altra Term Loan Facility\u201d) and a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility provided to Altra and certain of its subsidiaries in an aggregate committed principal amount of $300.0 million (the Altra Revolving Credit Facility\u201d and together with the Altra Term Loan Facility, the Altra Credit Facilities\u201d). The proceeds of the Altra Term Loan Facility were used to (i) consummate the Direct Sales, (ii) repay in full and extinguish all outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money under the 2015 Credit Agreement and (iii) pay certain fees, costs, and expenses in connection with the consummation of the Fortive Transaction. Any proceeds of the Altra Term Loan Facility not so used may be used for general corporate purposes. The proceeds of the Altra Revolving Credit Facility will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nALL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT.

Based on the stock price at December 31, 2018, of $25.15 per share, the intrinsic value of these awards as of December 31, 2018, was $20.7 million.\n \u2022 natural disasters, war, civil unrest, terrorism, fire, floods, tornadoes, earthquakes, hurricanes, or other matters beyond the Company's control; \n \u2022 the loss of independent distributors on which we rely; \n \u2022 the Company's ability to attract and retain key executives and other personnel; \n \u2022 the risks associated with the portion of the Company's total assets comprised of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles; \n \u2022 other risks associated with the Fortive Transaction, including; \nCritical Accounting Policies\n \u2022 the risks associated with interest rate swap contracts; \nNet sales in the Power Transmission Technologies segment were $935.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of approximately $58.3 million or 6.6%, from the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was due to the recovery of certain end markets and the favorable impact of foreign exchange, primarily by the euro of approximately $14.7 million. Segment operating income increased by approximately $21.0 million compared to the prior year.\nProvision for income taxes. The provision for income tax during the year ended December 31, 2017 was higher than that of 2016 due to increased income in 2017 in higher tax rate jurisdictions. During 2016 there was an impairment of intangibles in the United States and a loss on the extinguishment of debt which resulted in lower taxable income in the Company's' highest tax rate jurisdiction which impacted the effective tax rate. The provision for income taxes for 2017 reflected an increase in the tax provision of $7.4 million based on the recognition of a provisional U.S. tax charge for the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings as a result of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act which was offset by the benefit of $7.8 million derived from the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities.\nPower Transmission Technologies\nSegment Performance\nAmounts in thousands, except percentage data\n \u2022 the Company's ability to successfully pursue the Company's development activities and successfully integrate new operations and systems, including the realization of revenues, economies of scale, cost savings, and productivity gains associated with such operations; \n\n \u2022 the outcome of litigation to which the Company is a party from time to time, including product liability claims; \nGross profit. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased slightly during the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to the acquisition of the A&S Business. This increase was partially offset by the impact of amortization of acquired inventory related to the A&S acquisition in the amount of $14.2 million recorded at fair value rather than cost. Absent this fair value adjustment, the gross profit as a percent of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 would have been 33.2%.\n \u2022 changes in market conditions in which we operate that would influence the value of the Company's stock; \n \u2022 the risks associated with the Company's exposure to renewable energy markets; \nNet cash used in financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year to date period ended December 31, 2017 increased by $1,060.3 million. In 2018, cash from financing activities was driven by the borrowing of $1,340.0 million under the Altra Term Loan Facility, offset by payments of $281.6 million for the termination of the 2015 Credit Facility. In 2017, we used our cash to pay down approximately $51.6 million of debt.\nThe Altra Credit Facilities are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by Altra and by each direct or indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiary of Altra, subject to certain customary exceptions.\n\nAutomation & Specialty\n \u2022 the risks associated with transitioning from LIBOR to a replacement alternative reference rate; \nProvision for income taxes. The provision for income tax as a percentage of income before income taxes during the year ended December 31, 2018 was higher than that of 2017 due to non-deductible acquisition related costs coupled with GILTI tax as a result of the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act in the United States. The provision for income taxes for 2017 reflected an increase in the tax provision of $7.4 million based on the recognition of a provisional U.S. tax charge for the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings as a result of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act which was offset by a benefit of $7.8 million derived from the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities. Going forward the Company expects its consolidated tax rate to be approximately 25% to 27%.\nThe unaffiliated selling securityholder received the Selling Securityholder Notes from Fortive prior to the closing of the Private Placement in exchange for certain outstanding Fortive debt held or acquired by the unaffiliated selling securityholder. Stevens Holding used the net proceeds of the Primary Notes to fund a dividend payment to Fortive prior to the consummation of the Merger, and Stevens Holding did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the Selling Securityholder Notes.\n o possible inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, policies and compensation structures; \nBecause of the timing of the A&S acquisition and due to the fact that purchase accounting is not complete, we have performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether the fair value of the A&S reporting units are more likely than not less than the carrying value (\"Step 0\"). Based on the assessment, the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair values of the A&S reporting units were greater than the respective carrying amount, and as a result, did not proceed to further impairment testing.\nWe made capital expenditures of approximately $37.5 million and $32.8 million in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures during 2018 was due to the addition of the A&S Business. These capital expenditures will support on-going business needs. In 2019, we forecast capital expenditures to be in the range of $60.0 million to $65.0 million.\nOn December 12, 2016, the Company gave notice to The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., the Trustee under the Indenture governing the Convertible Notes (the Indenture\u201d) of its intention to redeem all of the Convertible Notes outstanding on January 12, 2017 (the Redemption Date\u201d), pursuant to the optional redemption provisions in the Indenture. The redemption price for the Convertible Notes was 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the Redemption Date plus a Make-Whole Premium equal to the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of interest on any Convertible Notes through March 1, 2018 (excluding interest accrued to, but excluding, the Redemption Date). In lieu of receiving the redemption price, holders of the Notes could surrender their Convertible Notes for conversion at any time before January 9, 2017. The conversion rate of the Convertible Notes was 39.0809 shares of the Company's common stock for each $1,000 of outstanding principal of the Convertible Notes. As of December 31, 2016, Convertible Notes with an outstanding principal amount of approximately $39.3 million were converted, resulting in the issuance of approximately 1.5 million shares of the Company's common stock. As a result of the conversion, the Company incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $1.9 million and the carrying value of the remaining Convertible Notes was $42.9 million net of unamortized discount as of December 31, 2016. In January 2017, additional Convertible Notes with an outstanding principal amount of approximately $44.7 million were converted resulting in the issuance of 1.7 million shares of the Company's common stock, and $0.9 million of Convertible Notes were redeemed for cash. The Company incurred an additional loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $1.8 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2017. All Convertible Notes were converted or redeemed as of January 12, 2017.\nPower Transmission Technologies.\n (1) A foreign subsidiary of the Company entered into a mortgage with a bank for \u20ac1.5 million, or $1.7 million, secured by its facility in Heidelberg, Germany to replace its previously existing mortgage during the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The mortgage has an interest rate of 1.79% which is payable in monthly installments through August 2023. The mortgage has a remaining principal balance of \u20ac0.9, or $1.0, at December 31, 2018. \n\nInflation\n\n \u2022 the effects of intense competition in the markets in which we operate; \n</table>\n \u2022 the Company's ability to retain existing customers and our ability to attract new customers for growth of our business; \nInflation can affect the costs of goods and services we use. The majority of the countries that are of significance to us, from either a manufacturing or sales viewpoint, have in recent years enjoyed relatively low inflation although there can be no assurance that inflation will not increase in future periods. The competitive environment in which we operate inevitably creates pressure on us to provide our customers with cost-effective products and services.\nAltra Credit Agreement\n\n (5) We have up to $300.0 million of total borrowing capacity, through October 1, 2025, under the Altra Revolving Credit Facility of which $295.8 million is currently available. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were $4.2 million and $3.5 million of outstanding letters of credit under the Altra Revolving Credit Facility and the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility. We have variable monthly and/or quarterly cash interest requirements due on the Altra Revolving Credit Facility through October 2025, which are not included in the above table. \n \u2022 changes in volatility of the Company's stock price and the risk of litigation following a decline in the price of the Company's stock; \nThe following is a summary of our cash balances and cash flows (in thousands) as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n \u2022 the risks associated with the Company's exposure to variable interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; \nCapital Expenditures\n \u2022 political and economic conditions globally, nationally, regionally, and in the markets in which we operate; \nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAs part of the annual goodwill impairment assessment we performed a quantitative assessment and estimated the fair value of each of our five reporting units in the PTT segment using an income approach. We forecasted future cash flows by reporting unit for each of the next five years and applied a long-term growth rate to the final year of forecasted cash flows. The cash flows were then discounted using our estimated discount rate. The forecasts of revenue and profitability growth for use in the long-range plan and the discount rate were the key assumptions in our goodwill fair value analysis. Our annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2018 indicated that in all instances, the fair values of our operating units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge. Given the excess fair value, we believe that a significant change in key valuation assumptions, including a decrease in revenues or profitability, or an increase in the discount rate, would not result in an indication of impairment.\nAccounting standards require that an annual goodwill impairment assessment be conducted at the reporting unit level using either a quantitative or qualitative approach. The Company has determined that its Power Transmission Technologies ( PTT\u201d) reporting segment is comprised of five reporting units. The Company has also determined that its A&S Business reporting segment is comprised of four reporting units.\n</td> </tr>\n \u2022 the risks associated with our debt; \nOther non-operating expense (income). Other non-operating expense (income) in each period in the chart above relates primarily to changes in foreign currency, primarily the Euro, British Pound, and Chinese Renminbi.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses increased due to the inclusion of R&D expenses for the A&S Business for the year ended December 31, 2018 in the amount of approximately $9.1 million. We expect research and development costs to approximate 2.0% - 3.0% of sales in future periods.\n\n\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2017, the Company commenced a new restructuring plan ( 2017 Altra Plan\u201d) as a result of the Stromag acquisition and to rationalize its global renewable energy business. The actions taken pursuant to the 2017 Altra Plan include reducing headcount, facility consolidations and the elimination of certain costs.\nBusiness Combinations. Business combinations are accounted for at fair value. Acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred and recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair value for assets and liabilities acquired. The fair value assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management's estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets\nThe Altra Credit Agreement contains usual and customary representations and warranties, and usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on liens, investments, restricted payments, additional indebtedness and asset sales and mergers. In addition, the Altra Credit Agreement requires that Altra maintain a specified maximum senior secured leverage ratio and a specified minimum interest coverage ratio. The obligations of the borrowers of the Altra Credit Facilities under the Altra Credit Agreement may be accelerated upon customary events of default, including non-payment of principal, interest, fees and other amounts, inaccuracy of representation and warranties, violation of covenants, cross default and cross acceleration, voluntary and involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, inability to pay debts as they become due, material judgements, ERISA events, actual or asserted invalidity of security documents or guarantees and change in control.\nOn October 1, 2018, Altra consummated the Fortive Transaction and acquired the A&S Business for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2,855.7 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments, which consisted of $1,400.0 million of cash and debt instruments transferred to Fortive and shares of Altra common stock received by Fortive shareholders valued at approximately $1,455.7 million. As of December 31, 2018, the initial accounting for the Fortive Transaction (including the allocation of the purchase price to acquired assets and liabilities) is not complete.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2016\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses increased due to the inclusion of Stromag for the year ended December 31, 2017. Research and development expenses remained consistent as a percentage of sales compared to the prior year.\nManagement believes the preparation of revenue and profitability growth rates for use in the long-range plan and the discount rate requires significant use of judgment. If any of our reporting units do not meet our forecasted revenue and/or profitability estimates, we could be required to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis in future periods. In addition, if our discount rate increases, we could be required to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis.\nOverview\nOn October 22, 2015, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by and among the Company, Altra Industrial Motion Netherlands, B.V., one of the Company's foreign subsidiaries (collectively with the Company, the Borrowers\u201d), the lenders party to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement from time to time (collectively, the Lenders\u201d), J.P, Morgan Securities LLC, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, and KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc., as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the Administrative Agent\u201d), to be guaranteed and secured by certain domestic subsidiaries of the Company, and which may be amended from time to time (the 2015 Credit Agreement\u201d).\nWe may be required to make cash outlays related to our unrecognized tax benefits. However, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2017, the we commenced a new restructuring plan ( 2017 Altra Plan\u201d) as a result of the Stromag acquisition and to rationalize its global renewable energy business. The actions taken pursuant to the 2017 Altra Plan include reducing headcount, facility consolidations and the elimination of certain costs. We expect to incur approximately $1.0 to $3.0 million in additional expense through 2019 related to the 2017 Altra Plan. We have achieved annual savings of $1.4 million during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 under the 2017 Altra Plan and estimates additional future savings during 2019 to be approximately $2.3 million. The cost savings for the year ended December 31, 2018 were recognized as improvements in SG&A and Cost of Sales of approximately $0.4 million and $0.7 million, respectively. The estimated future savings through 2019 are expected to improve SG&A and Cost of Sales by $0.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively. The total 2017 Altra Plan savings are in line with our expectations.\nSegment Performance.\nInterest expense. Interest expense decreased significantly during the period as a result of the conversion and redemption of our Convertible Notes, in December 2016 and January 2017, and the favorable impact of the cross-currency interest rate swaps despite the higher borrowing under our 2015 Revolving Credit Facility from the Stromag Acquisition.\n\nLong-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recovered. Long-lived assets are considered to be impaired if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset over its remaining useful life. If an asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value, and is charged to results of operations at that time.\n \u2022 the Company's ability to achieve its business plans, including with respect to an uncertain economic environment; \nWe believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in that they are important to the financial statements and they require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements.\n\n (2) A foreign subsidiary of the Company entered into a mortgage with a bank to borrow \u20ac6.0 million, or $6.7 million, for the expansion of its facility in Esslingen, Germany during August 2014. The mortgage has an interest rate of 2.5% per year which is payable in annual interest payments of \u20ac0.1 million or $0.1 million to be paid in monthly installments which are not included in the table above. The mortgage has a remaining principal balance of \u20ac6.0, or $6.9, at December 31, 2018. The principal portion of the mortgage will be due in a lump-sum payment in July 2028. \nSee the discussion of critical accounting policies in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRestructuring costs. During 2015 the Company adopted a restructuring plan ( 2015 Altra Plan\u201d) in response to weak demand in Europe and to make certain adjustments to improve business effectiveness, reduce the number of facilities and streamline the Company's cost structure. The actions taken pursuant to the 2015 Altra Plan included reducing headcount, facility consolidations and related asset impairments and limiting discretionary spending to improve profitability.\nContractual Obligations\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which reflect the Company's current estimates, expectations and projections about the Company's future results, performance, prospects and opportunities. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, the information concerning the Company's possible future results of operations including revenue, costs of goods sold, gross margin, future profitability, future economic improvement, business and growth strategies, financing plans, expected leverage levels, the Company's competitive position and the effects of competition, the projected growth of the industries in which we operate, and the Company's ability to consummate strategic acquisitions and other transactions. Forward-looking statements include statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by forward-looking words such as anticipate,\u201d believe,\u201d could,\u201d estimate,\u201d expect,\u201d intend,\u201d plan,\u201d may,\u201d should,\u201d will,\u201d would,\u201d project,\u201d forecast,\u201d and similar expressions or variations. These forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to the Company and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause the Company's actual results, performance, prospects, or opportunities to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from the results referred to in the forward-looking statements the Company makes in this report include:\nUnder the 2015 Credit Agreement, the amount of the Company's revolving credit facility was $350 million (the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). Prior to October 2018, the amounts available under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility were used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, and to repay existing indebtedness.\n \u2022 the cyclical nature of the markets in which we operate; \nRevolving borrowings and issuances of letters of credit under the Altra Revolving Credit Facility are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including the accuracy of representations and warranties and the absence of defaults.\nCash Flows for 2018\n o lost sales and customers as a result of customers of Altra or the A&S Business deciding not to do business with us; \nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that provide liquidity, capital resources, market or credit risk support that expose us to any liability that is not reflected in our consolidated financial statements.\n \u2022 the Company's ability to achieve the efficiencies, savings and other benefits anticipated from our cost reduction, margin improvement, restructuring, plant consolidation and other business optimization initiatives; \nGeneral\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. The vast majority of the increase in SG&A was due to the inclusion of SG&A related to the Stromag business. The decline of SG&A as a percentage of sales is primarily due to facility consolidation and restructuring activities.\nInterest expense. Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to the new debt instruments that the Company used to finance the acquisition of the A&S Business. We expect our interest expense in 2019 to increase as a result of additional borrowings to finance a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of the A&S Business.\nDuring 2019, the we commenced a restructuring plan ( 2019 Plan\u201d) to drive efficiencies, reduce the number of facilities and optimize our operating margin. We expect expenses related to workforce reductions, lease termination costs and other facility rationalization costs. We expect to incur $15 - $25 million in restructuring expenses under the 2019 Altra Plan over the next 4 years, primarily related to plant consolidation and headcount reductions.\nNet Sales. The increase in sales during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the acquisition of Stromag, price increases and higher sales levels in several end markets. Changes in foreign exchange rates also had a favorable impact on net sales of $2.0 million. Of the increase in sales, approximately $137.9 million related to the inclusion of additional sales as a result of the acquisition of Stromag. In addition, price increases contributed $6.2 million. The remainder of the increase related to a recovery in sales levels in various end markets in the Couplings, Clutches, and Brakes business segment.\n o risks associated with managing a larger and more complex business; \n \u2022 disruption of our supply chain; \n \u2022 the risks related to regulations regarding conflict minerals; \n \u2022 the effects of changes to critical accounting estimates; \n \u2022 the Company's risk of loss not covered by insurance; \n\n\nFunds provided by operating activities totaled approximately $80.6 million for fiscal 2017, a significant portion of which resulted from cash provided by net income of $51.4 million. In addition, the net impact of the add-back of certain non-cash items including depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, loss on disposal of fixed assets, loss on impairment of intangibles, loss on extinguishment of debt, loss on settlement of partial pension plan, deferred financing costs, provision for deferred taxes, amortization of inventory fair value adjustment, and non-cash gain on foreign currency was approximately $40.7 million. This was partially offset by a net increase in current assets and liabilities of approximately $11.5 million.\nRecent Accounting Standards\n\n2015 Credit Agreement\nOur future financial performance depends, in large part, on conditions in the markets that we serve and on the U.S., European, and global economies in general. Since completing the Fortive Transaction on October 1, 2018, our focus has been on the integration of the A&S Business and we have substantially completed the tactical components of that integration. In the quarter ended December 31, 2018, the addition of the A&S Business began to have a favorable impact on our financial performance. Looking forward, our strategic priorities are to continue to capitalize on our strong cash generation to de-lever our balance sheet while also implementing best practices from the Altra Business System to optimize sales growth and accelerate profitability, primarily through supply chain management, leveraging technology to drive innovation, and executing on organic growth and cross-selling opportunities.\nOn October 1, 2018, in connection with the Fortive Transaction and the entering into the Altra Credit Agreement, the 2015 Credit Agreement was terminated and all outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money thereunder was repaid in full.\n \u2022 changes in accounting rules and standards, audits, compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and regulatory investigations; \nBelow is a reconciliation of net debt for the year ended December 31, 2018:\n \u2022 the risks associated with the volatility and disruption in the global financial markets; \nNet cash used in financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year to date period ended December 31, 2016 decreased $223.8 million. In December 2016 we borrowed approximately $200 million under our 2015 Revolving Credit Facility for the Stromag Acquisition. In 2017, we used our cash to pay down approximately $51.6 million of debt.\n \u2022 the Company's ability to obtain or protect intellectual property rights and avoid infringing on the intellectual property rights of others; \nNet sales in the Automation & Specialty business segment were $241.7 million from the acquisition date of October 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018. Our gross profit margin for the same period increased by 170 basis points from 30.7% to 32.3%. This increase of gross profit margin was partially offset by the impact of amortization of acquired inventory related to the A&S acquisition of $14.2 million recorded at fair value rather than cost. Absent this fair value adjustment, the gross profit margin for the three-month period ended December 31, 2018 would have been 35.4%, an increase of 470 basis points.\n\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $44.9 million of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries that were subject to the Transition Toll Tax under the 2017 Tax Act, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.\nBusiness Outlook\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2017\n o the loss of key employees; \nPrior to October 2018, the amounts available under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility could be drawn upon in accordance with the terms of the 2015 Credit Agreement. All amounts outstanding under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility were due on the stated maturity or such earlier time, if any, required under the 2015 Credit Agreement. The amounts owed under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility could be prepaid at any time, subject to usual notification and breakage payment provisions. Interest on the amounts outstanding under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility was calculated using either an ABR Rate or Eurodollar Rate, plus the applicable margin. A portion of the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility could also be used for the issuance of letters of credit, and a portion of the amount of the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility was available for borrowings in certain agreed upon foreign currencies.\nFunds provided by operating activities totaled approximately $116.3 million for fiscal 2018, a significant portion of which resulted from cash provided by net income of $35.3 million. In addition, the net impact of the add-back of certain non-cash items including depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, loss on disposal of fixed assets, loss on settlement of partial pension plan, deferred financing costs, accretion of debt discount, benefit for deferred taxes, amortization of inventory fair value adjustment, and non-cash gain on foreign currency was approximately $79.2 million. Also, a net increase in current assets and liabilities provided cash of approximately $1.8 million.\n \u2022 the risks associated with the Company's being subject to tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions; \n o potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses associated with the Fortive Transaction; \n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nWe are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions throughout the world. Our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors, such as the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions, the tax rates in such jurisdictions, tax treaties between jurisdictions, the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions and repatriate income, and changes in law. Generally, the tax liability for each legal entity is determined either (a) on a non-consolidated and non-combined basis or (b) on a consolidated and combined basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction, in either case without regard to the taxable losses of non-consolidated and non-combined affiliated entities. As a result, we may pay income taxes to some jurisdictions even though on an overall basis we incur a net loss for the period.\nDATE OF THIS REPORT OR TO REFLECT THE OCCURRENCE OF UNANTICIPATED EVENTS.

We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on-going basis. Our estimates are based upon historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may vary from what our management anticipates and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results.\nNet sales in the Power Transmission Technologies segment were $876.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $167.8 million or 23.7%, from the year ended December 31, 2016. Approximately $137.9 million of the increase was due to the inclusion of sales from the newly acquired Stromag business for the year. Segment operating income increased by approximately $35.2 million compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of the addition of Stromag. The remainder of the increase was due to a modest recovery in certain end markets.\n \u2022 the risks associated with international operations, including currency risks; \nIncome Taxes\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased approximately $180.2 million due to the acquisition of Stromag in December 2016 for $188.0 million, net of cash received.\n o unanticipated issues in integrating manufacturing, logistics, information, communications and other systems; \nCash Flows for 2017\n\nBorrowings under the Altra Term Loan Facility will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to a Eurocurrency Rate\u201d plus 2.00%, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate borrowings, or equal to a Base Rate\u201d plus 1.00%, in the case of Base Rate borrowings. Borrowings under the Altra Revolving Credit Facility will initially bear interest at a per annum rate equal to a Eurocurrency Rate plus 2.00%, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate borrowings, or equal to a Base Rate plus 1.00%, in the case of Base Rate borrowings, and thereafter will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to a Eurocurrency Rate or Base Rate, as applicable, plus an interest rate spread determined by reference to a pricing grid based on Altra's senior secured net leverage ratio. In addition, Altra will be required to pay fees that will fluctuate between 0.250% per annum to 0.375% per annum on the unused amount of the Altra Revolving Credit Facility, based upon Altra's senior secured net leverage ratio. The interest rate on the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility was 4.52% at December 31, 2018.\n \u2022 changes in market conditions that would result in the impairment of goodwill or other assets of the Company; \n (7) A foreign subsidiary of the Company has a line of credit used for operating purposes. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had $13 million Turkish Lira or $3.0 million USD outstanding. \nAmounts in thousands, except percentage data\n\nOn October 1, 2018, we consummated the Fortive Transaction. The aggregate purchase price for the A&S Business was approximately $2,855.7 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments, and consisted of (i) $1,400.0 million of cash transferred to Fortive and (ii) shares of Altra common stock received by Fortive shareholders valued at approximately $1,455.7 million. The value of the common stock was based on the closing stock price on the A&S Closing Date of $41.59. We financed the cash portion of the Fortive Transaction with the Altra Credit Facilities (as defined herein).\nGoodwill, trade names and trademarks and IPR&D are considered indefinite lived assets. Our trade names and trademarks identify us and differentiate us from competitors, and therefore competition does not limit the useful life of these assets. Additionally, we believe that our trade names and trademarks will continue to generate product sales for an indefinite period.\nInventory. Inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The cost of inventory includes direct materials, direct labor, and production overhead. Market is defined as net realizable value. We state inventories acquired through acquisitions at their fair value at the date of acquisition based on the replacement cost of raw materials, the sales price of the finished goods less an appropriate amount representing the expected profitability from selling efforts, and, for work-in-process, the sales price of the finished goods less an appropriate amount representing the expected profitability from selling efforts and costs to complete.\n\nThe 2015 Credit Agreement contained various affirmative and negative covenants and restrictions, which among other things, required the Borrowers to provide certain financial reports to the Lenders, required the Company to maintain certain financial covenants relating to consolidated leverage and interest coverage, limited maximum annual capital expenditures, and limited the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other equity distributions, purchase or redeem capital stock or debt, make certain investments, sell assets, engage in certain transactions, and effect a consolidation or merger. The 2015 Credit Agreement also contained customary events of default.\nFrom time to time, we may have cash funding requirements associated with our pension plans. As of December 31, 2018, there were no funding requirements for 2019 to 2023. These amounts are based on actuarial assumptions and actual amounts could be materially different.\nRestructuring costs. During 2015 the we adopted the 2015 Altra Plan in response to weak demand in Europe and to make certain adjustments to improve business effectiveness, reduce the number of facilities and streamline our cost structure. The actions taken pursuant to the 2015 Altra Plan included reducing headcount, facility consolidations and related asset impairments and limiting discretionary spending to improve profitability. We do not expect to incur any additional material costs as a result of the 2015 Altra Plan. We took restructuring actions under the 2015 Altra Plan that realized approximate annual savings of $0.7 million and $3.0 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. We estimate future annual savings for 2019 to be approximately $0.1 million. The cost savings through 2018 were recognized as improvements in SG&A and Cost of Sales of approximately $2.0 million and $5.4 million, respectively. The estimated future savings through 2019 are expected to improve SG&A and Cost of Sales by $0.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively. The total 2015 Plan savings are in line with our expectations.\n \u2022 the Company's access to capital, credit ratings, indebtedness, and ability to raise additional capital and operate under the terms of the Company's debt obligations; \nWe intend to use our remaining cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operations to provide for our working capital needs, to fund potential future acquisitions, to service our debt, including principal payments, for capital expenditures, for pension funding, for share repurchases and to pay dividends to our stockholders. As of December 31, 2018, we have approximately $87.2 million of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating and investing cash needs. Furthermore, the existing cash balances and the availability of additional borrowings under our Altra Credit Facilities provide additional potential sources of liquidity should they be required.\nBelow is a summary of borrowings as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively:\n \u2022 the effects of the loss or bankruptcy of or default by any significant customer, suppliers, or other entity relevant to the Company's operations; \nWe finance our capital and working capital requirements through a combination of cash flows from operating activities and borrowings under the Altra Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2018, we have the ability under the Altra Revolving Credit Facility to borrow an additional $295.8 million subject to satisfying customary conditions. We expect that our primary ongoing requirements for cash will be for working capital, debt service, capital expenditures, acquisitions, pensions, dividends and share repurchases.\nTable 186: <table> <tr> <td>\nThe following table is a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\n\n\n\n \u2022 other factors, risks, and uncertainties referenced in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Risk Factors\u201d set forth in this document. \n\nGross profit. Gross profit as a percentage of sales improved slightly during the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was due to improvements realized from our facility consolidations, price increases and improving end markets. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by the impact of acquired inventory related to the Stromag acquisition in the amount of $2.3 million which was recorded at fair value rather than cost. Absent this fair value adjustment the gross profit as a percent of sales for 2017 would have been 31.7%.\n \u2022 the Company's ability to implement and maintain its Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system; \n \u2022 the risks associated with and potential impacts of new trade policies, legislation, treaties, and tariffs both in and outside of the United States; \n (3) During 2016, a foreign subsidiary of the Company entered into a loan with a bank to equip its facility in Zlate Moravce, Slovakia.

sales increased 34.1% to $1,175.3 million in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the acquisition of the Automation & Specialty (A&S) business. \n\n- Gross profit increased 24.1% to $376.1 million. Gross margin increased slightly to 32.0% in 2018 from 31.5% in 2017.\n\n- SG&A expenses increased 53.1% to $251.9 million, largely due to costs associated with the A&S acquisition. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased from 18.8% to 21.4%.\n\n- Net income decreased 31.2% to $35.3 million, primarily due to higher interest expense related to debt incurred for the A&S acquisition.\n\n- In October 2018, the company acquired the A&S business from Fortive Corporation for $2.9 billion, financed through new debt instruments and stock. \n\n- In October 2018, the company entered into a new $1.64 billion credit facility to fund the A&S acquisition and repay existing debt.\n\n- The company expects interest expense to increase in 2019 due to additional borrowings for the A&S acquisition. Key strategic priorities are integrating A&S, de-leveraging the balance sheet, and optimizing sales growth and profitability."}
