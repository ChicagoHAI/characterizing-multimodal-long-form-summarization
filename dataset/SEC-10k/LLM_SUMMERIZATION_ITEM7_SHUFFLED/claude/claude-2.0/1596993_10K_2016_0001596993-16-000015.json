Among other things, those financial statements include more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following information. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are presented in U.S. Dollars unless otherwise indicated. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth under \"Item 1A - Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in this report, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. Please see the section \"Forward-Looking Statements\" elsewhere in this report.\nFor the period April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013, the combined financial statements include the accounts of the vessel owning companies of our Initial Fleet, which we refer to collectively as our Predecessor or the Predecessor Businesses. Our financial position, results of operations and cash flows reflected in our Predecessor combined financial statements are not indicative of those that would have been achieved had we operated as an independent stand-alone entity for all periods presented or of future results. As such, the results of operations for Predecessor Businesses for the period April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013 are not comparable and have been presented separately.\nOverview\nWe are a Marshall Islands corporation, headquartered in the United States, focused on owning and operating very large gas carriers, or VLGCs, each with a cargo-carrying capacity of greater than 80,000 cbm. We currently own and\noperate twenty-two VLGC carriers, including nineteen new fuel-efficient 84,000 cbm ECO VLGCs and three 82,000 cbm VLGCs.\nSixteen of our ECO VLGCs were constructed by Hyundai and three of our ECO VLGCs were constructed at Daewoo. Our nineteen ECO VLGCs, which incorporate fuel efficiency and emission-reducing technologies and certain custom features, were acquired by us for an aggregate purchase price of $1.4 billion, which was financed with proceeds from the 2015 Debt Facility, proceeds from equity offerings, and cash generated from operations. These nineteen ECO VLGCs were delivered to us between July 2014 and February 2016, seventeen of which were delivered during calendar year 2015 or later.\nSixteen of the nineteen ECO VLGCs were delivered during the year ended March 31, 2016, and we borrowed $676.8 million in floating rate debt under the 2015 Debt Facility in connection with those deliveries. During the year we entered into four interest rate swap contracts which hedged $250 million of non-amortizing principal and $214.3 million of amortizing principal of the 2015 Debt Facility to fixed interest rates. In February 2016, we sold the Grendon, a 5,000 cbm PGC.\nOn April 1, 2015, Dorian and Phoenix began operations of the Helios Pool and entered into pool participation agreements for the purpose of establishing and operating, as charterer, under a variable rate time charter to be entered into with owners or disponent owners of VLGCs, a commercial pool of VLGCs whereby revenues and expenses are shared. The vessels entered into the Helios Pool may operate either in the spot market, pursuant to COAs or on time charters of two years' duration or less. As of March 31, 2016, eighteen of our twenty-two VLGCs were deployed in the Helios Pool.\nOur customers, either directly or through the Helios Pool, include or have included global energy companies such as Exxon, Unipec, Statoil and Shell, commodity traders such as Itochu Corporation and the Vitol Group and importers such as E1 Corp., SK Gas Co. Ltd. and Indian Oil Corporation. For the year ended March 31, 2016, the Helios Pool and one other individual charterer accounted for 70% and 12% of our total revenues, respectively. Within the Helios Pool, two charterers represented 19% and 14% of net pool revenues-related party for the year ended March 31, 2016. For the year ended March 31, 2015, five charterers represented 27%, 19%, 14%, 12% and 11% of total revenues, respectively. For the period ended March 31, 2014, three charterers represented 51%, 13% and 10% of total revenues, respectively. See Item 1A. Risk Factors-We operate exclusively in the LPG shipping industry. Due to our lack of diversification and the lack of diversification of the Helios Pool, adverse developments in the LPG shipping industry may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors-We expect to be dependent on a limited number of customers for a material part of our revenues, and failure of such customers to meet their obligations could cause us to suffer losses or negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.\u201d\nWe intend to pursue a balanced chartering strategy by employing our vessels on a mix of multi-year time charters, some of which may include a profit-sharing component, shorter-term time charters, spot market voyages and COAs. Six of our vessels are currently on fixed time charters, including two vessels on fixed time charter within the Helios Pool. See Item 1. Business-Our Fleet\u201d above for more information.\nOn August 5, 2015, we publicly announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of our common stock on or before December 31, 2016. As of March 31, 2016, we repurchased a total of 1,932,465 shares of our common stock for approximately $20.9 million under this program, resulting in $79.1 million of available authorization remaining.\nVessel Deployment-Spot Voyages, Time Charters, COAs, and Pooling Arrangements\nWe seek to employ our vessels in a manner that maximizes fleet utilization and earnings upside through our chartering strategy in line with our goal of maximizing shareholder value and returning capital to shareholders when appropriate, taking into account fluctuations in freight rates in the market and our own views on the direction of those rates in the future. As of March 31, 2016, eighteen of our twenty-two VLGCs were employed in the Helios Pool, which includes time charters with a term of less than two years.\nA spot market voyage charter is generally a contract to carry a specific cargo from a load port to a discharge port for an agreed upon freight per ton of cargo or a specified total amount. Under spot market voyage charters, we pay voyage expenses such as port and fuel costs. A time charter is generally a contract to charter a vessel for a fixed period of time at a set daily or monthly rate. Under time charters, the charterer pays voyage expenses such as port and fuel costs. Vessels operating on time charters provide more predictable cash flows, but can yield lower profit margins than vessels operating in the spot market during periods characterized by favorable market conditions. Vessels operating in the spot market generate revenues that are less predictable but may enable us to capture increased profit margins during periods of improvements in tanker rates although we are exposed to the risk of declining tanker rates and lower utilization. Pools generally consist of a number of vessels which may be owned by a number of different ship owners which operate as a single marketing entity in an effort to produce freight efficiencies. Pools typically employ experienced commercial charterers and operators who have close working relationships with customers and brokers while technical management is typically the responsibility of each ship owner. Under pool arrangements, vessels typically enter the pool under a time charter agreement whereby the cost of bunkers and port expenses are borne by the charterer (i.e., the pool) and operating costs, including crews, maintenance and insurance are typically paid by the owner of the vessel. Pools, in return, typically negotiate charters with customers primarily in the spot market. Since the members of a pool typically share in the revenue generated by the entire group of vessels in the pool, and since pools operate primarily in the spot market, including the pools in which we participate, the revenue earned by vessels placed in spot market related pools is subject to the fluctuations of the spot market and the ability of the pool manager to effectively charter its fleet. We believe that vessel pools can provide cost-effective commercial management activities for a group of similar class vessels and potentially result in lower waiting times.\nCOAs relate to the carriage of multiple cargoes over the same route and enables the COA holder to nominate different ships to perform individual voyages. It constitutes a number of voyage charters to carry a specified amount of cargo during the term of the COA, which usually spans a number of years. All of the vessel's operating, voyage and capital costs are borne by the ship owner.\nOn April 1, 2015, Dorian and Phoenix began operation of the Helios Pool, a 50% joint venture, which is a pool of VLGC vessels. We believe that the operation of certain of our VLGCs in this pool will allow us to achieve better market coverage and utilization. Vessels entered into the Helios Pool are commercially managed jointly by Dorian LPG (UK) Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary, and Phoenix. The members of the Helios Pool share in the net pool revenues generated by the entire group of vessels in the pool, weighted according to certain technical vessel characteristics, and net pool revenues (see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements) are distributed as variable rate time charter hire to each participant. The vessels entered into the Helios Pool may operate either in the spot market, COAs, or on time charters of two years' duration or less. In March 2016, the Helios Pool reached an agreement with Oriental Energy, one of the largest propane dehydrogenation plant operators and importers in China to operate eight VLGCs on its behalf. As of May 26, 2016, the Helios Pool operated twenty-four VLGCs, including eighteen of our vessels, four Phoenix vessels, and two Oriental Energy vessels. When fully delivered, the Helios Pool will operate six additional VLGCs for Oriental Energy, some of which will be time chartered-in at a fixed time charter hire rate. In addition, the Helios Pool has entered into a COA with Oriental Energy covering its shipments from the United States Gulf, which gives us exposure to the growing Chinese LPG market.\nImportant Financial and Operational Terms and Concepts\nWe use a variety of financial and operational terms and concepts in the evaluation of our business and operations including the following:\nVessel Revenue. Our revenues are driven primarily by the number of vessels in our fleet, the number of days during which our vessels operate and the amount of daily rates that our vessels earn under our charters, which, in turn, are affected by a number of factors, including levels of demand and supply in the LPG shipping industry; the age, condition and specifications of our vessels; the duration of our charters; the timing of when the profit sharing arrangements are earned; the amount of time that we spend positioning our vessels; the availability of our vessels, which is related to the amount of time that our vessels spend in drydock undergoing repairs and the amount of time required to perform necessary maintenance or upgrade work; and other factors affecting rates for LPG vessels.\nWe generate revenue by providing seaborne transportation services to customers pursuant to three types of contractual relationships:\nPooling Arrangements. As from April 1, 2015, we began operation of the Helios Pool. Net pool revenues-related party for each vessel is determined in accordance with the profit sharing terms specified within the pool agreement for the Helios Pool. In particular, the pool manager aggregates the revenues and voyage expenses of all of the pool participants and Helios Pool general and administrative expenses and distributes the net earnings to participants based on:\nTable 131: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\npool points (vessel attributes such as cargo carrying capacity, fuel consumption, and speed are taken into consideration); and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nnumber of days the vessel participated in the Helios Pool in the period. We recognize pool revenue on a monthly basis, when the vessel has participated in the Helios Pool during the period and the amount of pool revenue for the month can be estimated reliably. We receive estimated vessel earnings based on the known number of days the vessel has participated in the Helios Pool, the contract terms, and the estimated monthly pool revenue. We receive a report from the Helios Pool which identifies the number of days the vessel participated in the Helios Pool, the total pool points for the period, the total net pool revenues-related party for the period, and the calculated share of pool revenue for the vessel. We review the report for consistency with each vessel's pool agreement and vessel management records.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended March 31, 2016, approximately 70.2% of our revenue was generated through the Helios Pool as net pool revenues-related party. There were no revenues generated through pooling arrangements for the year ended March 31, 2015 and for the period July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014.\nVoyage Charters. A voyage charter, or spot charter, is a contract for transportation of a specified cargo between two or more designated ports. This type of charter is priced on a current or \"spot\" market rate, typically on a price per ton of product carried. Under voyage charters, we are responsible for all of the voyage expenses in addition to providing the crewing and other vessel operating services. Revenues for voyage charters are more volatile as they are typically tied to prevailing market rates at the time of the voyage. Our gross revenue under voyage charters are generally higher than under comparable time charters so as to compensate us for bearing all voyage expenses. As a result, our revenue and voyage expenses may vary significantly depending on our mix of time charters and voyage charters. For the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 and for the period July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014, approximately 16.0%, 74.3% and 37.8%, respectively, of our revenue was generated pursuant to voyage charters.\nTime Charters. A time charter is a contract under which a vessel is chartered for a defined period of time at a fixed daily or monthly rate. Under time charters, we are responsible for providing crewing and other vessel operating services, the cost of which is intended to be covered by the fixed rate, while the customer is responsible for substantially all of the voyage expenses, including bunker fuel consumption, port expenses and canal tolls. LPG is typically transported under a time charter arrangement, with terms ranging up to seven years. In addition, we may also have profit sharing arrangements with some of our customers that provide for additional payments above a floor monthly rate (usually up to an agreed ceiling) based on the actual, average daily rate quoted by the Baltic Exchange for Very Large Gas Carriers on the benchmark Ras Tanura-Chiba route over an agreed time period converted to a Time Charter Equivalent monthly rate. For the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 and for the period July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014, approximately 13.4%, 25.1% and 59.4%, respectively, of our revenue was generated pursuant to time charters from our VLGCs not in the Helios Pool.\nOther Revenues. Other revenues represents income from charterers, including the Helios Pool, relating to reimbursement of expenses such as costs for security guards and war risk insurance for voyages operating high risk areas. For the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 and for the period July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014, approximately 0.4%, 0.6% and 2.8%, respectively, of our revenue was generated pursuant to other revenues.\nCalendar Days. We define calendar days as the total number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet was owned. Calendar days are an indicator of the size of the fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of expenses that are recorded during that period.\nAvailable Days. We define available days as calendar days less aggregate off-hire days associated with scheduled maintenance, which include major repairs, drydockings, vessel upgrades or special or intermediate surveys. We use available days to measure the aggregate number of days in a period that our vessels should be capable of generating revenues.\nOperating Days. We define operating days as available days less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off-hire for any reason other than scheduled maintenance. We use operating days to measure the number of days in a period that our operating vessels are on hire.\nDrydocking. We must periodically drydock each of our vessels for any major repairs and maintenance and for inspection of the underwater parts of the vessel that cannot be performed while the vessels are operating and for any modifications to comply with industry certification or governmental requirements. We are required to drydock a vessel once every five years until it reaches fifteen years of age and thereafter every 2.5 years. We capitalize costs associated with the drydockings and amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the period through the date the next survey is scheduled to become due under the \"Deferral\" method permitted under U.S. GAAP. Costs incurred during the drydocking period which relate to routine repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The number of drydockings undertaken in a given period and the nature of the work performed determine the level of drydocking expenditures.\nFleet Utilization. We calculate fleet utilization by dividing the number of operating days during a period by the number of available days during that period. An increase in non-scheduled off-hire days would reduce our operating days, and therefore, our fleet utilization. We use fleet utilization to measure our ability to efficiently find suitable employment for our vessels.\nTime Charter Equivalent Rate. Time charter equivalent rate, or TCE rate, is a measure of the average daily revenue performance of a vessel. TCE rate is a shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period-to-period changes in a shipping company's performance despite changes in the mix of charter types (such as time charters, voyage charters) under which the vessels may be employed between the periods. Our method of calculating TCE rate is to divide revenue net of voyage expenses by operating days for the relevant time period.\nVoyage Expenses. Voyage expenses are all expenses unique to a particular voyage, including bunker fuel consumption, port expenses, canal fees, charter hire commissions, war risk insurance and security costs. Voyage expenses are typically paid by us under voyage charters and by the charterer under time charters. Accordingly, we generally only incur voyage expenses for our own account when performing voyage charters or during repositioning voyages between time charters for which no cargo is available or travelling to or from drydocking. We generally bear all voyage expenses under voyage charters and, as such, voyage expenses are generally greater under voyage charters than time charters. As a result, our voyage expenses may vary significantly depending on our mix of time charters and voyage charters.\nVessel Operating Expenses. Vessel operating expenses are expenses that are not unique to a specific voyage. Vessel operating expenses are paid by us under each of our charter types (as we do not employ our vessels on bare boat charters). Vessel operating expenses include crew wages and related costs, the costs for lubricants, insurance, expenses relating to repairs and maintenance, the cost of spares and consumable stores, tonnage taxes and other miscellaneous expenses. Our vessel operating expenses will increase with the expansion of our fleet and are subject to change because of higher crew costs, higher insurance premiums, unexpected repair expenses and general inflation. Furthermore, we expect maintenance costs will increase as our vessels age.\nDaily Vessel Operating Expenses. Daily vessel operating expenses are calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by calendar days for the relevant time period.\nManagement Fees-Related Party. Management fees to related parties ceased on June 30, 2014. They were paid pursuant to management agreements entered into by each vessel owning subsidiary with Dorian (Hellas) S.A., or\nDHSA. DHSA provided the financial, strategic, technical, crew and commercial management as well as insurance and accounting services to the vessel owning subsidiaries for a fee of $93,750 per vessel per month payable one month in advance effective from July 29, 2013 through June 30, 2014. Prior to July 29, 2013, our Predecessor paid a fixed monthly management fee of $40,000 per VLGC and $32,000 for our 5,000 cbm PGC. Eagle Ocean Transport Inc., or Eagle Ocean, and Highbury Shipping Services Limited, or Highbury also provided commercial and strategic services to the Predecessor. Mr. John Hadjipateras, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, owns 100% of Eagle Ocean, and our Vice President of Chartering, Insurance and Legal, Nigel Grey-Turner, owns 100% of Highbury.\nIn addition, DHSA provided us with pre-delivery services for each newbuilding, which included engineering and technical support, liaising with the shipyard, and ensuring key suppliers are integrated into the production planning process for a fee of $15,000 per month for each newbuilding contract. The fees for pre-delivery services were capitalized to the cost of the vessels under construction. The management fees were charged on a monthly basis per vessel and newbuilding contract and the total fees were affected by the number of vessels in our fleet and the number of newbuilding contracts managed.\nPursuant to transition agreements that became effective on July 1, 2014, or the Transition Agreements, we pay no further management or pre-delivery services fees to DHSA and we have transitioned all management functions to our wholly-owned subsidiaries Dorian LPG Management Corp., Dorian LPG (USA) LLC, and Dorian LPG (UK) Ltd. as of July 1, 2014. Subsequent to the completion of this transition, no fees for such services are paid to any related parties and no consideration is payable by us to DHSA.\nIn addition, pursuant to the Transition Agreements, each of DHSA, Eagle Ocean, and Highbury transferred a certain number of employees and selected assets to our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Subsequent to the Transition Agreements, Eagle Ocean continues to incur travel-related costs for certain transitioned employees as well as office-related costs. We reimbursed Eagle Ocean $0.8 million and $0.7 million at cost for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nDepreciation and Amortization. We depreciate our vessels on a straight-line basis using an estimated useful life of 25 years and after considering estimated salvage values. Our Predecessor used an estimated useful life of 20 years to 25 years depending on the type of vessel.\nWe amortize the cost of capitalized drydocking expenditures on a straight-line basis over the period through the date the next drydocking/special survey is scheduled to become due.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses principally consist of the costs incurred in the corporate administration of the vessel and non-vessel owning subsidiaries. Beginning July 1, 2014, we ceased to incur related-party management fees as a result of the completion of the Transaction Agreements described above under \"Management Fees-Related Party.\" In June 2014, we granted 655,000 restricted stock awards to certain of our officers and in March 2015, we granted 274,000 restricted stock awards to certain of our directors, employees and non-employee consultants (see Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters\u201d) that vest over five years. Granting of restricted stock results in an increase in expenses. Compensation expense for employees is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the awards and is recognized over the vesting period and for nonemployees is re-measured at the end of each reporting period based on the estimated fair value of the awards on that date and is recognized over the vesting period.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates in the application of our accounting policies based on our best assumptions, judgments and opinions. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. Accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider\nto be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties. For a description of our material accounting policies, please read Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nNet pool revenues-related party. Net pool revenues-related party for each vessel in the pool is determined in accordance with the profit sharing terms specified within the pool agreement. In particular, the pool manager calculates the net pool revenues using gross revenues less voyage expenses of all the pool vessels and less the general and administrative expenses of the pool and distributes the net pool revenues as time charter hire to participants based on:\nTable 133: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\npool points (vessel attributes such as cargo carrying capacity, fuel consumption, and construction characteristics are taken into consideration); and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nnumber of days the vessel participated in the pool in the period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe recognize net pool revenues-related party on a monthly basis, when the vessel has participated in the pool during the period and the amount of net pool revenues for the month can be estimated reliably.\nVessel Depreciation. The cost of our vessels less their estimated residual value is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the vessels' estimated useful lives. We estimate the useful life of each of our vessels to be 25 years from the date the vessel was originally delivered from the shipyard. Based on the current market and the types of vessels we plan to purchase, we expect the residual values of our vessels will be based upon a value of approximately $400 per lightweight ton. An increase in the useful life of our vessels or in their residual value would have the effect of decreasing the annual depreciation charge and extending it into later periods. An increase in the useful life of a vessel may occur as a result of superior vessel maintenance performed, favorable ocean going and weather conditions the vessel is subjected to, superior quality of the shipbuilding or yard, or high freight market rates, which result in owners scrapping the vessels later due to the attractive cash flows. A decrease in the useful life of our vessels or in their residual value would have the effect of increasing the annual depreciation charge and possibly result in an impairment charge. A decrease in the useful life of a vessel may occur as a result of poor vessel maintenance performed, harsh ocean going and weather conditions the vessel is subjected to, or poor quality of the shipbuilding or yard. However, when regulations place limitations over the ability of a vessel to trade on a worldwide basis, we will adjust the vessel's useful life to end at the date such regulations preclude such vessel's further commercial use.\nImpairment of long-lived assets. We review our vessels and other fixed assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. In addition, we compare independent appraisals to our carrying value for indicators of impairment to our vessels. When such indicators are present, an asset is tested for recoverability by comparing the estimate of future undiscounted net operating cash flows expected to be generated by the use of the asset over its remaining useful life and its eventual disposition to its carrying amount. An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value is in excess of the estimated future undiscounted net operating cash flows. The impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair market value of the asset. The new lower cost basis would result in a lower annual depreciation than before the impairment.\nOur estimates of fair market value assume that our vessels are all in good and seaworthy condition without need for repair and if inspected would be certified in class without notations of any kind. Our estimates are based on information available from various industry sources, including:\nTable 135: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nreports by industry analysts and data providers that focus on our industry and related dynamics affecting vessel values;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nnews and industry reports of similar vessel sales;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\napproximate market values for our vessels or similar vessels that we have received from shipbrokers, whether solicited or unsolicited, or that shipbrokers have generally disseminated;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\noffers that we may have received from potential purchasers of our vessels; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nvessel sale prices and values of which we are aware through both formal and informal communications with shipowners, shipbrokers, industry analysts and various other shipping industry participants and observers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs we obtain information from various industry and other sources, our estimates of fair market value are inherently uncertain. In addition, vessel values are highly volatile; as such, our estimates may not be indicative of the current or future fair market value of our vessels or prices that we could achieve if we were to sell them.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2016, independent appraisals of four of our VLGCs had indicators of impairment in accordance with ASC 360 Property, Plant, and Equipment. We determined estimated net operating cash flows for these VLGCs by applying various assumptions regarding future time charter equivalent revenues net of commissions, operating expenses, scheduled drydockings, expected offhire and scrap values. These assumptions were based on historical data as well as future expectations. We estimated spot market rates used are based on the trailing 10-year historical average spot market rates based on average rates published by maritime industry researchers. Estimated outflows for operating expenses and drydocking expenses were based on historical and budgeted costs and were adjusted for assumed inflation. Utilization was based on our historical levels achieved in the spot market and estimates of a residual value consistent with scrap rates used in management's evaluation of scrap value. Such estimates and assumptions regarding expected net operating cash flows require considerable judgment and were based upon historical experience, financial forecasts and industry trends and conditions. Therefore, based on this analysis, we concluded that no impairment charge was necessary because we believe the vessel carrying values are recoverable. No impairment charges were recognized for the year ended March 31, 2016.\nIn addition, we performed a sensitivity analysis as of March 31, 2016, to determine the effect on recoverability of changes in daily TCE rates. The sensitivity analysis suggests that we would not incur an impairment charge on any of those four VLGCs if daily TCE rates fell by 30% compared to the 10-year historical average spot market rates. An impairment charge of approximately $4.9 million on those four VLGCs would be triggered by a reduction of 40% in the 10-year historical average spot market rates. The amount, if any, and timing of any impairment charges we may recognize in the future will depend upon then current and expected future charter rates and vessel values, which may differ materially from those used in our estimates as of March 31, 2016.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2015, an independent appraisal of our PGC vessel indicated impairment and, therefore, we determined estimated net operating cash flows for our PGC vessel by applying the above methodology with the exception of utilizing 6-year historical average spot market rates. Management believes the use of estimates based on the 6-year historical average rates calculated as of the reporting date was reasonable for our PGC vessel as the vessel had a remaining useful life of six years. We recognized an impairment loss of $1.4 million for our PGC vessel to its fair value of $4.0 million, which resulted from the prolonged market weaknesses continuing into the fourth fiscal quarter in the year ended March 31, 2015, in the market for shipping petro-chemical gases, an important trade for PGC vessels. Sales of similarly aged PGC vessels reflected the market weaknesses and the impending newbuilding PGC vessels entering the global fleet.\nThe table set forth below indicates the carrying value of each owned vessel in our fleet as of March 31, 2016 and 2015 at which times none of the vessels listed in the table below were being held for sale:\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

We are required to drydock a vessel once every five years until it reaches 15 years of age, after which we are required to drydock the applicable vessel every 2.5 years.\nDrydocking costs are accounted under the deferral method whereby the actual costs incurred are deferred and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the period through the date the next drydocking is scheduled to become due. Costs deferred include expenditures incurred relating to shipyard costs, hull preparation and painting, inspection of hull structure and mechanical components, steelworks, machinery works, and electrical works. Drydocking costs do not include vessel operating expenses such as replacement parts, crew expenses, provisions, luboil consumption, insurance, management fees or management costs during the drydock period. Expenses related to regular maintenance and repairs of our vessels are expensed as incurred, even if such maintenance and repair occurs during the same time period as our drydocking.\nIf a drydocking is performed prior to the scheduled date, the remaining unamortized balances are immediately written off. Unamortized balances of vessels that are sold are written-off and included in the calculation of the resulting gain or loss in the period of the vessel's sale. The nature of the work performed and the number of drydockings undertaken in a given period determine the level of drydocking expenditures.\nFair Value of Derivative Instruments. We use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risks. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements is the estimated amount that we would receive or pay to terminate the agreements at the reporting date, taking into account current interest rates and the current credit worthiness of both us and the swap counterparties. The estimated amount is the present value of estimated future cash flows, being equal to the difference between the benchmark interest rate and the fixed rate in the interest rate swap agreement, multiplied by the notional principal amount of the interest rate swap agreement at each interest reset date\nThe fair value of our interest swap agreements at the end of each period are most significantly affected by the interest rate implied by the LIBOR interest yield curve, including its relative steepness. Interest rates have experienced significant volatility in recent years in both the short and long term. While the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements are typically more sensitive to changes in short-term rates, significant changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates also materially impact our interest.\nThe fair value of our interest swap agreements is also affected by changes in our own and our counterparty specific credit risk included in the discount factor. Our estimate of our counterparty's credit risk is based on the credit default swap spread of the relevant counterparty which is publicly available. The process of determining our own credit worthiness requires significant judgment in determining which source of credit risk information most closely matches our risk profile, which includes consideration of the margin we would be able to secure for future financing. A 10% increase / decrease in our own or our counterparty credit risk would not have had a significant impact on the fair value of our interest rate swaps.\nThe LIBOR interest rate yield curve and our specific credit risk are expected to vary over the life of the interest rate swap agreements. The larger the notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements outstanding and the longer the remaining duration of the interest rate swap agreements, the larger the impact of any variability in these factors will be on the fair value of our interest rate swaps. We economically hedge the interest rate exposure on a significant amount of our long-term debt and for long durations. As such, we have experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, material variations in the period-to-period fair value of our derivative instruments.\nAlthough we measure the fair value of our derivative instruments utilizing the inputs and assumptions described above, if we were to terminate the interest rate swap agreements at the reporting date, the amount we would pay or receive to terminate the derivative instruments may differ from our estimate of fair value. If the estimated fair value differs from the actual termination amount, an adjustment to the carrying amount of the applicable derivative asset or liability would be recognized in earnings for the current period. Such adjustments could be material.\nResults of Operations -Dorian LPG Ltd.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2015\nRevenues\nThe following table compares revenues for the years ended March 31:\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nIncrease /\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet pool revenues-related party\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n202,918,232 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n202,918,232 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nNM\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nVoyage charter revenues\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n46,194,134 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n77,331,934 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(31,137,800) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(40.3) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTime charter revenues\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n38,737,172 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n26,098,290 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12,638,882 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n48.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther revenues\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,358,291 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n698,925 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n659,366 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n94.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n289,207,829 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n104,129,149 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n185,078,680 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n177.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues of $289.2 million for the year ended March 31, 2016, including net pool revenues-related party, voyage charters, time charters and other revenues earned by our VLGCs and our PGC, increased $185.1 million, or 177.7%, from $104.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to $162.2 million of revenues contributed by sixteen of our newbuilding VLGCs that were delivered subsequent to March 31, 2015. Additionally, revenues contributed by VLGCs in our operating fleet during both periods increased $21.8 million resulting from employment of 2,101 operating days during the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to 1,512 operating days during the year ended March 31, 2015. The Grendon's revenues increased $1.1 million to $2.9 million on 224 operating days for the year ended March 31, 2016 from $1.8 million on 140 operating days for the year ended March 31, 2015.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2016, nineteen of our VLGCs operated within the Helios Pool, including one VLGC that left the Helios Pool to begin a long-term time charter in July 2015, and our VLGCs with the Helios Pool earned net pool revenues-related party of $202.9 million. Four of our VLGCs operated in the spot market outside of the Helios Pool and earned $43.3 million in voyage charter revenues and four of our VLGCs earned time charter revenues amounting to $38.7 million during the year ended March 31, 2016. For the year ended March 31, 2015, four of our VLGCs operated in the spot market and earned $76.1 million in voyage charter revenues, and three of our VLGCs earned time charter revenues during the period amounting to $25.5 million, including a VLGC that ended its time charter on July 27, 2014. Time charter revenues included $7.8 million of profit sharing for the year ended March 31, 2015.\nVoyage Expenses\nVoyage expenses were $12.1 million during the year ended March 31, 2016 a decrease of $10.0 million, or 45.4%, from $22.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2015. The decrease was mainly attributable to a decrease in the number of vessels operating on voyage charters as a result of vessels operating in the Helios Pool as well as decreases in fuel prices. These decreases resulted in decreases in bunker costs of $8.4 million, port expenses of $1.0 million and other voyage expenses of $0.6 million. Voyage expenses during the year ended March 31, 2016 mainly related to bunkers of $7.2 million, port charges and other related expenses of $2.6 million, brokers' commissions of $1.3 million, security costs of $0.4 million and other voyage expenses of $0.6 million. Voyage expenses during the year ended March 31, 2015 mainly related to bunkers of $15.7 million, port charges and other related expenses of $3.6 million, brokers' commissions of $1.7 million, security costs of $0.7 million and other voyage expenses of $0.4 million.\nVessel Operating Expenses\nVessel operating expenses were $47.1 million during the year ended March 31, 2016, or $8,581 per vessel per calendar day, which is calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by calendar days for the relevant time period for the vessels that were in our fleet. This was an increase of $25.8 million, or 121.7%, from $21.3 million or $10,703 per vessel per calendar day, for the year ended March 31, 2015. This increase is primarily the result of an increase of $24.0 million of vessel operating expenses attributable to sixteen of our ECO VLGCs that were delivered subsequent to March 31, 2015. Additionally, vessel operating expenses increased $1.8 million for the seven vessels that were in our fleet during both periods resulting from 2,518 calendar days during the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to 1,986 calendar days\nduring the year ended March 31, 2015. The decline in vessel operating expenses per vessel per calendar day during the year ended March 31, 2016 was largely due to the addition of newer vessels, which incur lower operating costs, along with a $0.5 million reduction in costs relating to the training of additional crew when compared to the year ended March 31, 2015.\nManagement Fees-Related Party\nBeginning July 1, 2014, we ceased to incur these related-party management fees as a result of the completion of the Transition Agreements described above in Important Financial and Operational Terms and Concepts-Management Fees-Related Party.\u201d Management fees expensed for the year ended March 31, 2015 represent fees charged by DHSA amounting to approximately $1.1 million in accordance with our management agreements entered into with DHSA. The management fees were charged on a monthly basis per vessel and the total fees were affected by the number of vessels in our fleet. No management fees-related party were incurred during the year ended March 31, 2016.\nImpairment\nWe did not incur any impairment charges during the year ended March 31, 2016. In the year ended March 31, 2015, we recognized an impairment loss of $1.4 million for our owned PGC vessel. This impairment loss was triggered by reductions in vessel values reflecting challenging conditions in the PGC market, and represented the difference between the carrying value and recoverable amount, being fair value.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization was approximately $42.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $28.5 million, or 202.2%, from $14.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to $23.8 million of depreciation and amortization related to sixteen of our ECO VLGCs that were delivered subsequent to March 31, 2015. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.7 million for the six VLGCs that were in our fleet during both years resulting from an increase in VLGC calendar days from 1,621 during the year ended March 31, 2015 to 2,196 during the year ended March 31, 2016.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $29.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $15.7 million, or 110.9%, from $14.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2015 mainly due to compensation-related increases of $8.9 million for salaries, wages and benefits (primarily due to an increase of $5.1 million relating to cash bonuses to various employees relating to the year ended March 31, 2016, as well as prior periods, were granted and expensed in the year ended March 31, 2016), $1.7 million for stock-based compensation, and $0.5 million in directors fees. Additionally, increases in conjunction with the build out of our operations amounted to $3.0 million for certain non-capitalizable costs incurred prior to vessel delivery including crew costs prior to initial voyage, $0.3 million in information technology and $1.3 million for other general and administrative expenses. During the year ended March 31, 2016, general and administrative expenses were comprised of $15.3 million of salaries and benefits (inclusive of the $3.0 million expense, approved by the board of directors in March 2016, for cash bonuses relating to the year ended March 31, 2016, and $2.1 million in cash bonuses, approved by the board of directors in May 2015, to various employees for services related to prior periods), $4.1 million of stock-based compensation, $3.4 million for certain non-capitalizable costs incurred prior to vessel delivery, $2.5 million for professional, legal, audit and accounting fees and $4.5 million of other general and administrative expenses. During the year ended March 31, 2015, general and administrative expenses were comprised of $6.4 million of salaries and benefits (inclusive of a $0.4 million accrual for statutory retirement benefits for our Greece-based employees), $2.4 million for professional, legal, audit and accounting fees, $2.3 million of stock-based compensation and $3.0 million of other general and administrative expenses.\nLoss on disposal of assets\nLoss on disposal of assets amounted to $1.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2016 and was primarily attributable to the sale of the Grendon. There was no loss on disposal of assets for the year ended March 31, 2015.\nOther income -related parties\nOther income -related parties amounted to $1.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $1.8 million from $0.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to $1.4 million of fees for commercial management services provided by Dorian LPG (UK) Ltd. to the Helios Pool as well an increase of $0.5 million for certain chartering and marine operation services provided by Dorian LPG (USA) LLC and its subsidiaries to DHSA.\nInterest and Finance Costs\nInterest and finance costs amounted to $12.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $12.5 million from $0.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2015. The increase of $12.5 million during this period was mainly due to a $13.8 million increase in interest incurred on our long-term debt, amortization and other financing expenses from $3.8 million in the year ended March 31, 2015 to $17.6 million in the year ended March 31, 2016. These increases were partially offset by a $1.3 million increase in capitalized interest from $3.5 million in the year ended March 31, 2015 to $4.8 million in the year ended March 31, 2016. The average indebtedness during the year ended March 31, 2016 was $543.1 million compared to $125.9 million during the year ended March 31, 2015, reflecting debt drawdowns of $676.8 million made under our 2015 Debt Facility. The outstanding balance of our long term debt as of March 31, 2016 was $836.4 million.\nLoss on Derivatives, net\nLoss on derivatives, net was $15.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $11.8 million, or 298.5%, compared to $4.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in unrealized losses from the changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps of $10.2 million during the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the year ended March 31, 2015. Additionally, the increase is attributable to an increase of $1.6 million of realized loss due to an increase in the notional debt amounts during the year ended March 31, 2016 compared the year ended March 31, 2015. The net loss on derivatives for the year ended March 31, 2016 was comprised of an unrealized loss of $8.9 million from the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps due mainly to changes in yield curves along with a realized loss of $6.9 million due mainly to an increase in notional debt amounts due to four new interest rate swaps we entered into during the period. For the year ended March 31, 2015, the net loss on derivatives was primarily comprised of a realized loss of $5.3 million, partially offset by an unrealized gain of $1.3 million from the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps.\nForeign Currency Gain/(Loss), net\nForeign currency gain/(loss), net amounted to a net loss of approximately $0.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2016. This was a decrease in the loss of $0.7 million, or 65.7%, compared to a loss of $1.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to unrealized losses from cash held in Norwegian Krone during the year ended March 31, 2015 that did not recur during the year ended March 31, 2016.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2015 as compared to the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014\nThe Company remained substantially inactive for the period from July 1, 2013 until July 29, 2013, the date of our business combination with the Predecessor Businesses of Dorian LPG Ltd. Because we acquired three VLGC vessels during the year ended March 31, 2015 and the period from July 1, 2013 through March 31, 2014 included only eight months of active operations, we do not believe that the results of operations of the Company for the year ended March 31, 2015 and for the period July 1, 2013 through March 31, 2014 are directly comparable.\nRevenues\nThe following table compares revenues for the year ended March 31, 2015 as compared to the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014:\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPeriod July 1, 2013\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(inception) to\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nIncrease /\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMarch 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nVoyage charter revenues\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n77,331,934 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n11,210,785 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n66,121,149 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n589.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTime charter revenues\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n26,098,290 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17,602,137 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,496,153 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n48.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther revenues\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n698,925 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n820,778 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(121,853) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(14.8) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n104,129,149 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n29,633,700 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n74,495,449 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n251.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues of $104.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2015 represent time charter and voyage charters earned for our six VLGC vessels and our PGC, an increase of $74.5 million, or 251.4%, from $29.6 million for the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase of $42.6 million contributed by the four vessels that were in our fleet during both periods resulting from increases in charter rates and the number of these vessels operating in the spot market, as well as employment of 1,173 operating days during the year ended March 31, 2015 compared to 941 operating days during the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. Additionally, $31.9 million of revenues were contributed by three of our ECO VLGCs that were delivered subsequent to March 31, 2014. For the year ended March 31, 2015, four of our VLGCs operated in the spot market and earned $76.1 million in voyage charter revenues. Three of our VLGCs earned time charter revenues during the period amounting to $25.5 million, including a VLGC that ended its time charter on July 27, 2014. Time charter revenues included $7.8 million of profit sharing. For the year ended March 31, 2015, the Grendon, whose time charter expired at the end of May 2014, earned $1.8 million of revenues, had 140 operating days and was in drydock for 10 days. Revenues of $29.6 million for the period July 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014 represent charter hire and voyage charters earned for our three VLGC vessels and our PGC. Revenues from time charter hire earned for our two VLGC vessels and the Grendon amounted to $17.8 million, of which $6.1 million represented profit sharing, and revenues from voyage charter for one VLGC vessel amounted to $11.8 million. The Captain Nicholas ML was in drydock for the period from August 28, 2013 to September 14, 2013 and did not earn revenue during this time.\nVoyage Expenses\nVoyage expenses were approximately $22.1 million during the year ended March 31, 2015, an increase of $15.4 million, or 231.0%, from $6.7 million for the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase of $9.6 million for the four vessels that were in our fleet during both periods resulting from an increase in the number of these vessels operating in the spot market as well as employment of 1,173 operating days during the year ended March 31, 2015 compared to 941 operating days during the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. Additionally, $5.7 million of voyage expenses were attributable to three of our ECO VLGCs that were delivered subsequent to March 31, 2014. Voyage expenses during the year ended March 31, 2015 mainly related to bunkers of $15.7 million, port charges and other related expenses of $3.6 million, brokers' commissions of $1.7 million, security costs of $0.7 million and other voyage expenses of $0.4 million. Voyage expenses were approximately $6.7 million during the period July 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014 and mainly related to bunkers of $5.3 million, port charges of $0.6 million, brokers' commissions of $0.4 million, security costs of $0.3 million, and other voyage expenses of $0.1 million.\nVessel Operating Expenses\nVessel operating expenses were approximately $21.3 million during the year ended March 31, 2015, or $10,703 per vessel per calendar day, which is calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by calendar days for the relevant time period. This was an increase of $12.9 million, or 153.2%, from $8.4 million, or $8,531 per vessel per calendar day, for the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase of $6.7 million for the four vessels that were in our fleet during both periods resulting from 1,460 calendar days during the year ended March 31, 2015 compared to 984 calendar days during the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. Additionally, $6.2 million of vessel operating expenses attributable to three of our ECO VLGCs that were delivered\nsubsequent to March 31, 2014. Vessel operating expenses for the year ended March 31, 2015 included approximately $2.9 million relating to training of additional crew on our operating VLGC fleet in anticipation of newbuilding deliveries. The Grendon, which ended its time charter at the end of May 2014, had 140 operating days and was in drydock for 10 days for the year ended March 31, 2015. The Grendon had $2.8 million of vessel operating expenses, inclusive of $0.5 million of expenses related to repairs and maintenance, for the year ended March 31, 2015.\nManagement Fees-Related Party\nFor the year ended March 31, 2015, management fees-related party decreased $2.0 million, or 64.0%, from the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. Beginning July 1, 2014, we ceased to incur these related-party management fees as a result of the completion of the Transition Agreements described above in Important Financial and Operational Terms and Concepts-Management Fees-Related Party.\u201d Management fees expensed for the year ended March 31, 2015 represent fees charged by DHSA amounting to approximately $1.1 million in accordance with our management agreements entered into with DHSA. The management fees were charged on a monthly basis per vessel and the total fees were affected by the number of vessels in our fleet. Management fees expensed for the period July 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014 represent fees charged by DHSA amounting to approximately $3.0 million representing $93,750 per vessel per month and $0.1 million for Management fees relating to pre-delivery services, both in accordance with our management agreements entered into with DHSA. The management fees were charged on a monthly basis per vessel and the total fees were affected by the number of vessels in our fleet.\nImpairment\nIn the year ended March 31, 2015, we recognized an impairment loss of $1.4 million for our owned PGC vessel. This impairment loss was triggered by reductions in vessel values reflecting challenging conditions in the PGC market, and represented the difference between the carrying value and recoverable amount, being fair value. We did not incur any impairment charges during the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization was approximately $14.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2015 and mainly relates to depreciation expense for our operating vessels, which represented an increase of $7.5 million, or 112.9%, from $6.6 million for the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to $4.1 million of depreciation and amortization related to three of our ECO VLGCs that were delivered subsequent to March 31, 2014. Additionally, there was an increase of $3.4 million for the four vessels that were in our fleet during both periods resulting from an increase in calendar days from 984 during the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014 to 1,460 during the year ended March 31, 2015. Depreciation and amortization was approximately $6.6 million for the period July 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014 and mainly relates to depreciation expense for our Initial Fleet from the date of acquisition, July 29, 2013.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were approximately $14.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2015, an increase of $13.7 million, or 3,161.7%, from $0.4 million for the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. This increase was primarily a result of a majority of general and administrative expenses being covered under our management agreement with DHSA during the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. During the year ended March 31, 2015, general and administrative expenses were comprised of $6.4 million of salaries and benefits (inclusive of a $0.4 million accrual for statutory retirement benefits for our Greece-based employees), $2.4 million for professional, legal, audit and accounting fees, $2.3 million of stock-based compensation and $3.0 million of other general and administrative expenses. Prior to July 1, 2014, general and administrative expenses were primarily covered under our management agreement with DHSA, which terminated on June 30, 2014. Expenses not covered under the management agreement included, among others, stock-based compensation, audit and accounting fees, professional and legal fees and investor relations. As of July 1, 2014, vessel management services for our fleet was transferred from DHSA and are now provided through our wholly owned subsidiaries.\nInterest and Finance Costs\nInterest and finance costs amounted to approximately $0.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2015, a decrease of $1.3 million, or 81.7%, from $1.6 million for the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. This decrease was primarily a result of a larger percentage of our interest costs being capitalized to our newbuilding vessels during the year ended March 31, 2015 compared to the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. The interest and finance costs for the year ended March 31, 2015 consisted of interest incurred on our long-term debt of $2.7 million, amortization of financing costs of $0.8 million, and $0.3 million of other financing expenses, less capitalized interest of $3.5 million. The average indebtedness during the year ended March 31, 2015 was $125.9 million and the outstanding balance of our long-term debt as of March 31, 2015 was $200.3 million, which included $81.2 million under the 2015 Debt Facility. Interest and finance costs amounted to approximately $1.6 million for the period July 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014.

The increase is primarily attributable to an increase of $1.6 million of realized loss due to a higher number of days in the year ended March 31, 2015 compared to the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. Additionally, the unrealized gain from the changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps decreased $1.3 million during the year ended March 31, 2015 compared to the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. For the year ended March 31, 2015, the net loss on derivatives of approximately $4.0 million was primarily comprised of a realized loss of $5.3 million, partially offset by an unrealized gain of $1.3 million from the changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps.

Revenues from time charter hire earned for two VLGC vessels and one PGC vessel amounted to $9.2 million, of which $2.7 million represented profit sharing. Revenues from voyage charter for one VLGC vessel amounted to $6.2 million for the period April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013.\nVoyage Expenses\nVoyage expenses were approximately $3.8 million for the period April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013. Voyage expenses were comprised mainly of bunkers of $2.8 million, charter hire commissions of $0.4 million, port charges and other related expenses of $0.4 million and security costs of $0.2 million.\nVessel Operating Expenses\nVessel operating expenses were approximately $4.6 million for the period April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013, or $9,745 per calendar day.\nManagement Fees-related party\nManagement fees charged by DHSA for the period April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013 were approximately $0.6 million relating to fees of $40,000 per VLGC vessel per month and $32,000 for the PGC vessel per month.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization for our fleet for the period April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013 was $4.0 million, which were comprised of depreciation of $3.9 million and amortization of deferred charges from drydock and special survey costs of approximately $0.1 million.\nInterest and Finance Costs\nInterest and finance costs amounted to approximately $0.8 million for the period April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013 primarily relating to the interest incurred on long-term debt.\nGain/(Loss) on Derivatives, net\nGain/(loss) on derivatives, net, amounted to a net gain of approximately $2.8 million for the period April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013. The gain on derivatives comprised a gain from the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps of $4.7 million due to an increase in forward Libor curve rates, partially offset by a realized loss of $1.9 million for the period April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur business is capital intensive, and our future success depends on our ability to maintain a high-quality fleet. As of March 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $46.4 million and restricted cash of $50.8 million.\nOur primary sources of capital during the year ended March 31, 2016 was $676.8 million of proceeds from the 2015 Debt Facility that we used to make the final payments for our sixteen ECO VLGCs delivered during the year ended March 31, 2016 and $151.0 million in cash generated from operations during the year ended March 31, 2016. As of March 31, 2016, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $836.4 million and within the next twelve months, $66.3 million of principal on our long-term debt is scheduled to be repaid.\nOperating expenses, including to maintain the quality of our vessels, comply with international shipping standards and environmental laws and regulations and fund working capital requirements, long-term debt repayments, financing costs, including the repayment of principal and interest under our debt facilities, and repurchases of our own securities represent our short-term, medium-term and long-term liquidity needs as of March 31, 2016. We anticipate satisfying these needs with cash on hand, cash from operations and/or debt financings.\nOur dividend policy will also impact our future liquidity position. Marshall Islands law generally prohibits the payment of dividends other than from surplus or while a company is insolvent or would be rendered insolvent by the payment of such a dividend. In addition, under the terms of our credit facilities, we may only declare or pay any dividends from our free cash flow and may not do so if i) an event of default is occurring or ii) the payment of such dividend would result in an event of default. Our vessel owning subsidiaries who are party to the RBS Loan Facility, as described in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements, are prohibited from paying dividends without the consent of the lender.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we will continue to consider strategic opportunities, including the acquisition of additional vessels and repurchases of our own securities. We may choose to pursue such opportunities through internal growth or joint ventures or business acquisitions. We expect to finance the purchase price of any additional future acquisitions and our operations either through internally generated funds, debt financings (public or private), the issuance of additional equity securities (public or private) or a combination of these forms of financing.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents provided by (used in) operating, financing and investing activities for the periods presented:\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPeriod July 1, 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYear ended\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYear ended\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(inception) to\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nMarch 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nMarch 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nMarch 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n151,027,500 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n25,623,220 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,236,422 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(910,414,841) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(312,326,844) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(221,434,724) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n601,090,409 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n213,694,591 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n493,322,093 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(158,409,221) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(74,310,612) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n279,131,795 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents provided by (used in) operating, financing and investing activities of our predecessor for the period presented:\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPredecessor\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nApril 1, 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nto July 28,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,670,470 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(90,492) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(5,606,000) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(1,026,022) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Cash Flows. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2016 amounted to $151.0 million compared with $25.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2015. The increase primarily reflects higher earnings and was driven by an increase in our number of vessels from seven as of March 31, 2015, to twenty-two as of March 31, 2016, as well as an increase in our time charter equivalent rate from $49,665 during the year ended March 31, 2015, to $55,087 during the year ended March 31, 2016.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the period July 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014 amounted to $7.2 million, primarily as a result of our operating profits, net of non-cash adjustments to net income, which were offset partially by payments for drydocking costs of $0.4 million.\nPredecessor: Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $4.7 million for the period April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013 as a result of favorable movements in working capital.\nNet cash flow from operating activities depends upon our overall profitability, market rates for vessels employed on voyage charters, charter rates agreed to for time charters, the timing and amount of payments for drydocking expenditures and unscheduled repairs and maintenance, fluctuations in working capital balances and bunker costs.\nInvesting Cash Flows. Net cash used in investing activities was $910.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $598.1 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2015. For the year ended March 31, 2016, net cash used in investing activities comprised mainly of $895.1 million of scheduled payments to the shipyards, supervision costs, management fees, and other capitalized costs related to newbuildings, and $17.6 million of restricted cash deposits, partially offset by $2.7 million of proceeds from asset disposals. Net cash used in investing activities of $312.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2015, comprised mainly of $314.2 million of scheduled payments to the shipyards, supervision costs, management fees, and other capitalized costs related to newbuildings, partially offset by a $2.2 million decrease in restricted cash.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $221.4 million for the period July 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014 comprised mainly of payments for vessels and vessels under construction of $172.2 million, a net increase in restricted cash of $35.4 million, which was comprised of an increase of $71.0 million from the original funding of the account from the a private placement in July 2013 offset by a decrease of $35.6 million due to an accelerated payment of $28.4 million to the shipyard in return for a reduction in the contract price of the vessel and the scheduled payment of $7.2 million, and net payments to acquire the Predecessor Businesses of $13.7 million.\nPredecessor: Net cash used in investing activities was $0.1 million for the period from April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013 as a result of payments for vessel improvements.\nFinancing Cash Flows. Net cash provided by financing activities was $601.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2016 an increase of $387.4 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2015. For the year ended March 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities consisted of $676.8 million of borrowings related to our 2015 Debt Facility partially offset by repayments of long term debt of $40.8 million, treasury stock repurchases of $20.9 million and debt financing costs of $14.0 million. Net cash provided by financing activities was $213.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2015 and consisted of cash proceeds from our initial public offering, the overallotment exercise by the underwriters of our initial public offering, and a private placement of our common stock, together totaling $155.8 million, and $80.1 million in cash proceeds from borrowings related to our 2015 Debt Facility offset partially by debt financing costs of $11.2 million, repayments of long term debt of $9.6 million and payment of equity issuance costs of $1.4 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $493.3 million for the period July 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014 and consisted of cash proceeds from three private placements of common shares totaling $510.5 million, offset partially by repayments of long term debt of $6.5 million, payment of financing costs of $1.5 million and payments relating to equity issuance costs of $9.2 million.\nPredecessor: Net cash used in financing activities amounted to $5.6 million for the period April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013 and reflects the scheduled repayments due under our long-term debt.\nCapital Expenditures. LPG transportation is a capital-intensive business, requiring significant investment to maintain an efficient fleet and to stay in regulatory compliance.\nWe are required to complete a special survey for a vessel once every five years until 15 years of age and thereafter every 2.5 years and an intermediate survey every 2.5 years after the first special survey. Drydocking each vessel takes approximately 10-20 days. We spend significant amounts for scheduled drydocking (including the cost of classification society surveys) for each of our vessels.\nAs our vessels age and our fleet expands, our drydocking expenses will increase. We estimate the current cost of a VLGC special survey to be approximately $1,000,000 and the cost of an intermediate survey to be approximately\n$100,000. Ongoing costs for compliance with environmental regulations are primarily included as part of our drydocking and classification society survey costs.

We determined estimated net operating cash flows for these VLGCs by applying various assumptions regarding future time charter equivalent revenues net of commissions, operating expenses, scheduled drydockings, expected offhire and scrap values. These assumptions were based on historical data as well as future expectations. We estimated spot market rates used are based on the trailing 10-year historical average spot market rates based on average rates published by maritime industry researchers. Estimated outflows for operating expenses and drydocking expenses were based on historical and budgeted costs and were adjusted for assumed inflation. Utilization was based on our historical levels achieved in the spot market and estimates of a residual value consistent with scrap rates used in management's evaluation of scrap value. Such estimates and assumptions regarding expected net operating cash flows require considerable judgment and were based upon historical experience, financial forecasts and industry trends and conditions. Therefore, based on this analysis, we concluded that no impairment charge was necessary because we believe the vessel carrying values are recoverable. No impairment charges were recognized for the year ended March 31, 2016.\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayments due by period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nLess than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMore than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n1 to 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n3 to 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt obligations\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n836,368,372 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n66,265,643 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n179,613,571 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n145,736,071 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n444,753,087 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest payments(1)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n109,847,782 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n22,277,248 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n37,836,256 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n24,360,959 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n25,373,319 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRemaining payments on office leases(2)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n876,200 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n382,194 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n462,543 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n31,463 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n947,092,354 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n88,925,085 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n217,912,370 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n170,128,493 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n470,126,406 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nsubsequent to March 31, 2014.

expenses were $29.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $15.7 million, or 110.9%, from $14.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2015 mainly due to compensation-related increases of $8.9 million for salaries, wages and benefits (primarily due to an increase of $5.1 million relating to cash bonuses to various employees relating to the year ended March 31, 2016, as well as prior periods, were granted and expensed in the year ended March 31, 2016), $1.7 million for stock-based compensation, and $0.5 million in directors fees. Additionally, increases in conjunction with the build out of our operations amounted to $3.0 million for certain non-capitalizable costs incurred prior to vessel delivery including crew costs prior to initial voyage, $0.3 million in information technology and $1.3 million for other general and administrative expenses. During the year ended March 31, 2016, general and administrative expenses were comprised of $15.3 million of salaries and benefits (inclusive of the $3.0 million expense, approved by the board of directors in March 2016, for cash bonuses relating to the year ended March 31, 2016, and $2.1 million in cash bonuses, approved by the board of directors in May 2015, to various employees for services related to prior periods), $4.1 million of stock-based compensation, $3.4 million for certain non-capitalizable costs incurred prior to vessel delivery, $2.5 million for professional, legal, audit and accounting fees and $4.5 million of other general and administrative expenses. During the year ended March 31, 2015, general and administrative expenses were comprised of $6.4 million of salaries and benefits (inclusive of a $0.4 million accrual for statutory retirement benefits for our Greece-based employees), $2.4 million for professional, legal, audit and accounting fees, $2.3 million of stock-based compensation and $3.0 million of other general and administrative expenses.\nThe following table compares revenues for the years ended March 31:\nLoss on Derivatives, net\nVoyage Expenses\nRevenues\nInvesting Cash Flows. Net cash used in investing activities was $910.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $598.1 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2015. For the year ended March 31, 2016, net cash used in investing activities comprised mainly of $895.1 million of scheduled payments to the shipyards, supervision costs, management fees, and other capitalized costs related to newbuildings, and $17.6 million of restricted cash deposits, partially offset by $2.7 million of proceeds from asset disposals. Net cash used in investing activities of $312.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2015, comprised mainly of $314.2 million of scheduled payments to the shipyards, supervision costs, management fees, and other capitalized costs related to newbuildings, partially offset by a $2.2 million decrease in restricted cash.\nResults of Operations-Predecessor Businesses of Dorian LPG Ltd.\nOur estimates of fair market value assume that our vessels are all in good and seaworthy condition without need for repair and if inspected would be certified in class without notations of any kind. Our estimates are based on information available from various industry sources, including:\nGeneral and administrative expenses were approximately $14.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2015, an increase of $13.7 million, or 3,161.7%, from $0.4 million for the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. This increase was primarily a result of a majority of general and administrative expenses being covered under our management agreement with DHSA during the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. During the year ended March 31, 2015, general and administrative expenses were comprised of $6.4 million of salaries and benefits (inclusive of a $0.4 million accrual for statutory retirement benefits for our Greece-based employees), $2.4 million for professional, legal, audit and accounting fees, $2.3 million of stock-based compensation and $3.0 million of other general and administrative expenses. Prior to July 1, 2014, general and administrative expenses were primarily covered under our management agreement with DHSA, which terminated on June 30, 2014. Expenses not covered under the management agreement included, among others, stock-based compensation, audit and accounting fees, professional and legal fees and investor relations. As of July 1, 2014, vessel management services for our fleet was transferred from DHSA and are now provided through our wholly owned subsidiaries.\nLoss on derivatives, net was $15.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $11.8 million, or 298.5%, compared to $4.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in unrealized losses from the changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps of $10.2 million during the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the year ended March 31, 2015. Additionally, the increase is attributable to an increase of $1.6 million of realized loss due to an increase in the notional debt amounts during the year ended March 31, 2016 compared the year ended March 31, 2015. The net loss on derivatives for the year ended March 31, 2016 was comprised of an unrealized loss of $8.9 million from the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps due mainly to changes in yield curves along with a realized loss of $6.9 million due mainly to an increase in notional debt amounts due to four new interest rate swaps we entered into during the period. For the year ended March 31, 2015, the net loss on derivatives was primarily comprised of a realized loss of $5.3 million, partially offset by an unrealized gain of $1.3 million from the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps.\nOur business is capital intensive, and our future success depends on our ability to maintain a high-quality fleet. As of March 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $46.4 million and restricted cash of $50.8 million.\nOur primary sources of capital during the year ended March 31, 2016 was $676.8 million of proceeds from the 2015 Debt Facility that we used to make the final payments for our sixteen ECO VLGCs delivered during the year ended March 31, 2016 and $151.0 million in cash generated from operations during the year ended March 31, 2016. As of March 31, 2016, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $836.4 million and within the next twelve months, $66.3 million of principal on our long-term debt is scheduled to be repaid.\nIn addition, pursuant to the Transition Agreements, each of DHSA, Eagle Ocean, and Highbury transferred a certain number of employees and selected assets to our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Subsequent to the Transition Agreements, Eagle Ocean continues to incur travel-related costs for certain transitioned employees as well as office-related costs. We reimbursed Eagle Ocean $0.8 million and $0.7 million at cost for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n \u00b7 offers that we may have received from potential purchasers of our vessels; and \nInterest and Finance Costs\nRevenues of $15.4 million for the period April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013 represent charter hire and voyage charters earned for three VLGC vessels and one PGC vessel. Revenues from time charter hire earned for two VLGC vessels and one PGC vessel amounted to $9.2 million, of which $2.7 million represented profit sharing. Revenues from voyage charter for one VLGC vessel amounted to $6.2 million for the period April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013.\nOn August 5, 2015, we publicly announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of our common stock on or before December 31, 2016. As of March 31, 2016, we repurchased a total of 1,932,465 shares of our common stock for approximately $20.9 million under this program, resulting in $79.1 million of available authorization remaining.\nITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOperating Days. We define operating days as available days less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off-hire for any reason other than scheduled maintenance. We use operating days to measure the number of days in a period that our operating vessels are on hire.\nThe LIBOR interest rate yield curve and our specific credit risk are expected to vary over the life of the interest rate swap agreements. The larger the notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements outstanding and the longer the remaining duration of the interest rate swap agreements, the larger the impact of any variability in these factors will be on the fair value of our interest rate swaps. We economically hedge the interest rate exposure on a significant amount of our long-term debt and for long durations. As such, we have experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, material variations in the period-to-period fair value of our derivative instruments.\nRevenues\nFor the year ended March 31, 2016, approximately 70.2% of our revenue was generated through the Helios Pool as net pool revenues-related party. There were no revenues generated through pooling arrangements for the year ended March 31, 2015 and for the period July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014.\nOperating expenses, including to maintain the quality of our vessels, comply with international shipping standards and environmental laws and regulations and fund working capital requirements, long-term debt repayments, financing costs, including the repayment of principal and interest under our debt facilities, and repurchases of our own securities represent our short-term, medium-term and long-term liquidity needs as of March 31, 2016. We anticipate satisfying these needs with cash on hand, cash from operations and/or debt financings.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $493.3 million for the period July 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014 and consisted of cash proceeds from three private placements of common shares totaling $510.5 million, offset partially by repayments of long term debt of $6.5 million, payment of financing costs of $1.5 million and payments relating to equity issuance costs of $9.2 million.\nContractual Obligations\nAs our vessels age and our fleet expands, our drydocking expenses will increase. We estimate the current cost of a VLGC special survey to be approximately $1,000,000 and the cost of an intermediate survey to be approximately\nWe intend to pursue a balanced chartering strategy by employing our vessels on a mix of multi-year time charters, some of which may include a profit-sharing component, shorter-term time charters, spot market voyages and COAs. Six of our vessels are currently on fixed time charters, including two vessels on fixed time charter within the Helios Pool. See Item 1. Business-Our Fleet\u201d above for more information.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nAvailable Days. We define available days as calendar days less aggregate off-hire days associated with scheduled maintenance, which include major repairs, drydockings, vessel upgrades or special or intermediate surveys. We use available days to measure the aggregate number of days in a period that our vessels should be capable of generating revenues.\nA spot market voyage charter is generally a contract to carry a specific cargo from a load port to a discharge port for an agreed upon freight per ton of cargo or a specified total amount. Under spot market voyage charters, we pay voyage expenses such as port and fuel costs. A time charter is generally a contract to charter a vessel for a fixed period of time at a set daily or monthly rate. Under time charters, the charterer pays voyage expenses such as port and fuel costs. Vessels operating on time charters provide more predictable cash flows, but can yield lower profit margins than vessels operating in the spot market during periods characterized by favorable market conditions. Vessels operating in the spot market generate revenues that are less predictable but may enable us to capture increased profit margins during periods of improvements in tanker rates although we are exposed to the risk of declining tanker rates and lower utilization. Pools generally consist of a number of vessels which may be owned by a number of different ship owners which operate as a single marketing entity in an effort to produce freight efficiencies. Pools typically employ experienced commercial charterers and operators who have close working relationships with customers and brokers while technical management is typically the responsibility of each ship owner. Under pool arrangements, vessels typically enter the pool under a time charter agreement whereby the cost of bunkers and port expenses are borne by the charterer (i.e., the pool) and operating costs, including crews, maintenance and insurance are typically paid by the owner of the vessel. Pools, in return, typically negotiate charters with customers primarily in the spot market. Since the members of a pool typically share in the revenue generated by the entire group of vessels in the pool, and since pools operate primarily in the spot market, including the pools in which we participate, the revenue earned by vessels placed in spot market related pools is subject to the fluctuations of the spot market and the ability of the pool manager to effectively charter its fleet. We believe that vessel pools can provide cost-effective commercial management activities for a group of similar class vessels and potentially result in lower waiting times.\n \u00b7 number of days the vessel participated in the Helios Pool in the period. We recognize pool revenue on a monthly basis, when the vessel has participated in the Helios Pool during the period and the amount of pool revenue for the month can be estimated reliably. We receive estimated vessel earnings based on the known number of days the vessel has participated in the Helios Pool, the contract terms, and the estimated monthly pool revenue. We receive a report from the Helios Pool which identifies the number of days the vessel participated in the Helios Pool, the total pool points for the period, the total net pool revenues-related party for the period, and the calculated share of pool revenue for the vessel. We review the report for consistency with each vessel's pool agreement and vessel management records. \n\nInterest and finance costs amounted to approximately $0.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2015, a decrease of $1.3 million, or 81.7%, from $1.6 million for the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. This decrease was primarily a result of a larger percentage of our interest costs being capitalized to our newbuilding vessels during the year ended March 31, 2015 compared to the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. The interest and finance costs for the year ended March 31, 2015 consisted of interest incurred on our long-term debt of $2.7 million, amortization of financing costs of $0.8 million, and $0.3 million of other financing expenses, less capitalized interest of $3.5 million. The average indebtedness during the year ended March 31, 2015 was $125.9 million and the outstanding balance of our long-term debt as of March 31, 2015 was $200.3 million, which included $81.2 million under the 2015 Debt Facility. Interest and finance costs amounted to approximately $1.6 million for the period July 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014. The interest and finance costs consisted of interest incurred on our long-term debt of $1.7 million, amortization of financing costs of $0.8 million and $0.1 million of other financing costs less capitalized interest of $1.0 million. The average indebtedness during the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014 was $132.6 million and the outstanding balance of our long-term debt as of March 31, 2014, was $128.7 million.\nVessel operating expenses were approximately $21.3 million during the year ended March 31, 2015, or $10,703 per vessel per calendar day, which is calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by calendar days for the relevant time period. This was an increase of $12.9 million, or 153.2%, from $8.4 million, or $8,531 per vessel per calendar day, for the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase of $6.7 million for the four vessels that were in our fleet during both periods resulting from 1,460 calendar days during the year ended March 31, 2015 compared to 984 calendar days during the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. Additionally, $6.2 million of vessel operating expenses attributable to three of our ECO VLGCs that were delivered\nOther Revenues. Other revenues represents income from charterers, including the Helios Pool, relating to reimbursement of expenses such as costs for security guards and war risk insurance for voyages operating high risk areas. For the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 and for the period July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014, approximately 0.4%, 0.6% and 2.8%, respectively, of our revenue was generated pursuant to other revenues.\nThe table set forth below indicates the carrying value of each owned vessel in our fleet as of March 31, 2016 and 2015 at which times none of the vessels listed in the table below were being held for sale:\nInterest Income\nImpairment\nFor the year ended March 31, 2016, nineteen of our VLGCs operated within the Helios Pool, including one VLGC that left the Helios Pool to begin a long-term time charter in July 2015, and our VLGCs with the Helios Pool earned net pool revenues-related party of $202.9 million. Four of our VLGCs operated in the spot market outside of the Helios Pool and earned $43.3 million in voyage charter revenues and four of our VLGCs earned time charter revenues amounting to $38.7 million during the year ended March 31, 2016. For the year ended March 31, 2015, four of our VLGCs operated in the spot market and earned $76.1 million in voyage charter revenues, and three of our VLGCs earned time charter revenues during the period amounting to $25.5 million, including a VLGC that ended its time charter on July 27, 2014. Time charter revenues included $7.8 million of profit sharing for the year ended March 31, 2015.\nPredecessor: Net cash used in investing activities was $0.1 million for the period from April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013 as a result of payments for vessel improvements.\nWe are a Marshall Islands corporation, headquartered in the United States, focused on owning and operating very large gas carriers, or VLGCs, each with a cargo-carrying capacity of greater than 80,000 cbm. We currently own and\nRevenues\nNet pool revenues-related party. Net pool revenues-related party for each vessel in the pool is determined in accordance with the profit sharing terms specified within the pool agreement. In particular, the pool manager calculates the net pool revenues using gross revenues less voyage expenses of all the pool vessels and less the general and administrative expenses of the pool and distributes the net pool revenues as time charter hire to participants based on:\nFor the year ended March 31, 2015, an independent appraisal of our PGC vessel indicated impairment and, therefore, we determined estimated net operating cash flows for our PGC vessel by applying the above methodology with the exception of utilizing 6-year historical average spot market rates. Management believes the use of estimates based on the 6-year historical average rates calculated as of the reporting date was reasonable for our PGC vessel as the vessel had a remaining useful life of six years. We recognized an impairment loss of $1.4 million for our PGC vessel to its fair value of $4.0 million, which resulted from the prolonged market weaknesses continuing into the fourth fiscal quarter in the year ended March 31, 2015, in the market for shipping petro-chemical gases, an important trade for PGC vessels. Sales of similarly aged PGC vessels reflected the market weaknesses and the impending newbuilding PGC vessels entering the global fleet.\nFair Value of Derivative Instruments. We use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risks. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements is the estimated amount that we would receive or pay to terminate the agreements at the reporting date, taking into account current interest rates and the current credit worthiness of both us and the swap counterparties. The estimated amount is the present value of estimated future cash flows, being equal to the difference between the benchmark interest rate and the fixed rate in the interest rate swap agreement, multiplied by the notional principal amount of the interest rate swap agreement at each interest reset date\n \u00b7 reports by industry analysts and data providers that focus on our industry and related dynamics affecting vessel values; \nto be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties. For a description of our material accounting policies, please read Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nSee Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our debt obligations.\nResults of Operations -Dorian LPG Ltd.\nDrydocking costs are accounted under the deferral method whereby the actual costs incurred are deferred and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the period through the date the next drydocking is scheduled to become due. Costs deferred include expenditures incurred relating to shipyard costs, hull preparation and painting, inspection of hull structure and mechanical components, steelworks, machinery works, and electrical works. Drydocking costs do not include vessel operating expenses such as replacement parts, crew expenses, provisions, luboil consumption, insurance, management fees or management costs during the drydock period. Expenses related to regular maintenance and repairs of our vessels are expensed as incurred, even if such maintenance and repair occurs during the same time period as our drydocking.\nDrydocking. We must periodically drydock each of our vessels for any major repairs and maintenance and for inspection of the underwater parts of the vessel that cannot be performed while the vessels are operating and for any modifications to comply with industry certification or governmental requirements. We are required to drydock a vessel once every five years until it reaches fifteen years of age and thereafter every 2.5 years. We capitalize costs associated with the drydockings and amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the period through the date the next survey is scheduled to become due under the \"Deferral\" method permitted under U.S. GAAP. Costs incurred during the drydocking period which relate to routine repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The number of drydockings undertaken in a given period and the nature of the work performed determine the level of drydocking expenditures.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nIf a drydocking is performed prior to the scheduled date, the remaining unamortized balances are immediately written off. Unamortized balances of vessels that are sold are written-off and included in the calculation of the resulting gain or loss in the period of the vessel's sale. The nature of the work performed and the number of drydockings undertaken in a given period determine the level of drydocking expenditures.\nRevenues of $104.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2015 represent time charter and voyage charters earned for our six VLGC vessels and our PGC, an increase of $74.5 million, or 251.4%, from $29.6 million for the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase of $42.6 million contributed by the four vessels that were in our fleet during both periods resulting from increases in charter rates and the number of these vessels operating in the spot market, as well as employment of 1,173 operating days during the year ended March 31, 2015 compared to 941 operating days during the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. Additionally, $31.9 million of revenues were contributed by three of our ECO VLGCs that were delivered subsequent to March 31, 2014. For the year ended March 31, 2015, four of our VLGCs operated in the spot market and earned $76.1 million in voyage charter revenues. Three of our VLGCs earned time charter revenues during the period amounting to $25.5 million, including a VLGC that ended its time charter on July 27, 2014. Time charter revenues included $7.8 million of profit sharing. For the year ended March 31, 2015, the Grendon, whose time charter expired at the end of May 2014, earned $1.8 million of revenues, had 140 operating days and was in drydock for 10 days. Revenues of $29.6 million for the period July 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014 represent charter hire and voyage charters earned for our three VLGC vessels and our PGC. Revenues from time charter hire earned for our two VLGC vessels and the Grendon amounted to $17.8 million, of which $6.1 million represented profit sharing, and revenues from voyage charter for one VLGC vessel amounted to $11.8 million. The Captain Nicholas ML was in drydock for the period from August 28, 2013 to September 14, 2013 and did not earn revenue during this time.\nOperating Cash Flows. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2016 amounted to $151.0 million compared with $25.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2015. The increase primarily reflects higher earnings and was driven by an increase in our number of vessels from seven as of March 31, 2015, to twenty-two as of March 31, 2016, as well as an increase in our time charter equivalent rate from $49,665 during the year ended March 31, 2015, to $55,087 during the year ended March 31, 2016.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the period July 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014 amounted to $7.2 million, primarily as a result of our operating profits, net of non-cash adjustments to net income, which were offset partially by payments for drydocking costs of $0.4 million.\nPursuant to transition agreements that became effective on July 1, 2014, or the Transition Agreements, we pay no further management or pre-delivery services fees to DHSA and we have transitioned all management functions to our wholly-owned subsidiaries Dorian LPG Management Corp., Dorian LPG (USA) LLC, and Dorian LPG (UK) Ltd. as of July 1, 2014. Subsequent to the completion of this transition, no fees for such services are paid to any related parties and no consideration is payable by us to DHSA.\nOur dividend policy will also impact our future liquidity position. Marshall Islands law generally prohibits the payment of dividends other than from surplus or while a company is insolvent or would be rendered insolvent by the payment of such a dividend. In addition, under the terms of our credit facilities, we may only declare or pay any dividends from our free cash flow and may not do so if i) an event of default is occurring or ii) the payment of such dividend would result in an event of default. Our vessel owning subsidiaries who are party to the RBS Loan Facility, as described in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements, are prohibited from paying dividends without the consent of the lender.\nOn April 1, 2015, Dorian and Phoenix began operation of the Helios Pool, a 50% joint venture, which is a pool of VLGC vessels. We believe that the operation of certain of our VLGCs in this pool will allow us to achieve better market coverage and utilization. Vessels entered into the Helios Pool are commercially managed jointly by Dorian LPG (UK) Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary, and Phoenix. The members of the Helios Pool share in the net pool revenues generated by the entire group of vessels in the pool, weighted according to certain technical vessel characteristics, and net pool revenues (see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements) are distributed as variable rate time charter hire to each participant. The vessels entered into the Helios Pool may operate either in the spot market, COAs, or on time charters of two years' duration or less. In March 2016, the Helios Pool reached an agreement with Oriental Energy, one of the largest propane dehydrogenation plant operators and importers in China to operate eight VLGCs on its behalf. As of May 26, 2016, the Helios Pool operated twenty-four VLGCs, including eighteen of our vessels, four Phoenix vessels, and two Oriental Energy vessels. When fully delivered, the Helios Pool will operate six additional VLGCs for Oriental Energy, some of which will be time chartered-in at a fixed time charter hire rate. In addition, the Helios Pool has entered into a COA with Oriental Energy covering its shipments from the United States Gulf, which gives us exposure to the growing Chinese LPG market.\nTime Charters. A time charter is a contract under which a vessel is chartered for a defined period of time at a fixed daily or monthly rate. Under time charters, we are responsible for providing crewing and other vessel operating services, the cost of which is intended to be covered by the fixed rate, while the customer is responsible for substantially all of the voyage expenses, including bunker fuel consumption, port expenses and canal tolls. LPG is typically transported under a time charter arrangement, with terms ranging up to seven years. In addition, we may also have profit sharing arrangements with some of our customers that provide for additional payments above a floor monthly rate (usually up to an agreed ceiling) based on the actual, average daily rate quoted by the Baltic Exchange for Very Large Gas Carriers on the benchmark Ras Tanura-Chiba route over an agreed time period converted to a Time Charter Equivalent monthly rate. For the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 and for the period July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014, approximately 13.4%, 25.1% and 59.4%, respectively, of our revenue was generated pursuant to time charters from our VLGCs not in the Helios Pool.\n \u00b7 vessel sale prices and values of which we are aware through both formal and informal communications with shipowners, shipbrokers, industry analysts and various other shipping industry participants and observers. \nManagement Fees-Related Party. Management fees to related parties ceased on June 30, 2014. They were paid pursuant to management agreements entered into by each vessel owning subsidiary with Dorian (Hellas) S.A., or\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses principally consist of the costs incurred in the corporate administration of the vessel and non-vessel owning subsidiaries. Beginning July 1, 2014, we ceased to incur related-party management fees as a result of the completion of the Transaction Agreements described above under \"Management Fees-Related Party.\" In June 2014, we granted 655,000 restricted stock awards to certain of our officers and in March 2015, we granted 274,000 restricted stock awards to certain of our directors, employees and non-employee consultants (see Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters\u201d) that vest over five years. Granting of restricted stock results in an increase in expenses. Compensation expense for employees is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the awards and is recognized over the vesting period and for nonemployees is re-measured at the end of each reporting period based on the estimated fair value of the awards on that date and is recognized over the vesting period.\nThe following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents provided by (used in) operating, financing and investing activities of our predecessor for the period presented:\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates in the application of our accounting policies based on our best assumptions, judgments and opinions. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. Accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider\nDepreciation and Amortization\nForeign currency gain/(loss), net amounted to a net loss of approximately $0.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2016. This was a decrease in the loss of $0.7 million, or 65.7%, compared to a loss of $1.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to unrealized losses from cash held in Norwegian Krone during the year ended March 31, 2015 that did not recur during the year ended March 31, 2016.\nForeign currency gain/(loss), net amounted to a net loss of approximately $1.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2015, and comprised mainly of unrealized losses from cash held in Norwegian Krone. This was a decrease of $1.7 million compared to the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. Foreign currency gain/(loss), net amounted to a net gain approximately $0.7 million for the period July 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014, and were comprised mainly of realized gains of $1.9 million from payments in U.S. dollars received in advance of the closing of the November 26, 2013 equity private placement transactions priced in Norwegian Krone and converted to U.S. dollars, partially offset by realized losses of $1.2 million from payments in U.S. dollars received in advance of the closing of the February 12, 2014 equity private placement transactions priced in Norwegian Krone and converted to U.S. dollars.\nAs we obtain information from various industry and other sources, our estimates of fair market value are inherently uncertain. In addition, vessel values are highly volatile; as such, our estimates may not be indicative of the current or future fair market value of our vessels or prices that we could achieve if we were to sell them.\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated and our Predecessor Businesses' combined financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. Among other things, those financial statements include more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following information. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are presented in U.S. Dollars unless otherwise indicated. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth under \"Item 1A - Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in this report, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. Please see the section \"Forward-Looking Statements\" elsewhere in this report.\nFinancing Cash Flows. Net cash provided by financing activities was $601.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2016 an increase of $387.4 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2015. For the year ended March 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities consisted of $676.8 million of borrowings related to our 2015 Debt Facility partially offset by repayments of long term debt of $40.8 million, treasury stock repurchases of $20.9 million and debt financing costs of $14.0 million. Net cash provided by financing activities was $213.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2015 and consisted of cash proceeds from our initial public offering, the overallotment exercise by the underwriters of our initial public offering, and a private placement of our common stock, together totaling $155.8 million, and $80.1 million in cash proceeds from borrowings related to our 2015 Debt Facility offset partially by debt financing costs of $11.2 million, repayments of long term debt of $9.6 million and payment of equity issuance costs of $1.4 million.\nVoyage expenses were $12.1 million during the year ended March 31, 2016 a decrease of $10.0 million, or 45.4%, from $22.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2015. The decrease was mainly attributable to a decrease in the number of vessels operating on voyage charters as a result of vessels operating in the Helios Pool as well as decreases in fuel prices. These decreases resulted in decreases in bunker costs of $8.4 million, port expenses of $1.0 million and other voyage expenses of $0.6 million. Voyage expenses during the year ended March 31, 2016 mainly related to bunkers of $7.2 million, port charges and other related expenses of $2.6 million, brokers' commissions of $1.3 million, security costs of $0.4 million and other voyage expenses of $0.6 million. Voyage expenses during the year ended March 31, 2015 mainly related to bunkers of $15.7 million, port charges and other related expenses of $3.6 million, brokers' commissions of $1.7 million, security costs of $0.7 million and other voyage expenses of $0.4 million.\nInterest and finance costs amounted to approximately $0.8 million for the period April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013 primarily relating to the interest incurred on long-term debt.\n\nCalendar Days. We define calendar days as the total number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet was owned. Calendar days are an indicator of the size of the fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of expenses that are recorded during that period.\nManagement fees charged by DHSA for the period April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013 were approximately $0.6 million relating to fees of $40,000 per VLGC vessel per month and $32,000 for the PGC vessel per month.\nImpairment\nWe currently do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nVessel Deployment-Spot Voyages, Time Charters, COAs, and Pooling Arrangements\nCapital Expenditures. LPG transportation is a capital-intensive business, requiring significant investment to maintain an efficient fleet and to stay in regulatory compliance.\n \u00b7 number of days the vessel participated in the pool in the period. \nGain/(Loss) on Derivatives, net\nDepreciation and Amortization\n (4) During the year ended March 31, 2015, an impairment loss was taken on the Grendon of $1.4 million and the carrying value was written down to $4.0 million. The Grendon was sold in February 2016 and had no carrying value as of March 31, 2016. \nFor the year ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2015\nLoss on derivatives, net, was $4.0 million for year ended March 31, 2015, an increase of $2.9 million, or 258.6%, from a net loss of approximately $1.1 million for the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase of $1.6 million of realized loss due to a higher number of days in the year ended March 31, 2015 compared to the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. Additionally, the unrealized gain from the changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps decreased $1.3 million during the year ended March 31, 2015 compared to the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. For the year ended March 31, 2015, the net loss on derivatives of approximately $4.0 million was primarily comprised of a realized loss of $5.3 million, partially offset by an unrealized gain of $1.3 million from the changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps. For the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014, net loss on derivatives of approximately $1.1 million comprised of a realized loss of $3.7 million, partially offset by an unrealized gain of $2.6 million from the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps.\n \u00b7 approximate market values for our vessels or similar vessels that we have received from shipbrokers, whether solicited or unsolicited, or that shipbrokers have generally disseminated; \n (2) Our United Kingdom and Greece office lease payments were translated into U.S. Dollars using foreign currency equivalent rates of British Pound Sterling 1.44 and Euro 1.14, respectively, as of March 31, 2016. \nWe recognize net pool revenues-related party on a monthly basis, when the vessel has participated in the pool during the period and the amount of net pool revenues for the month can be estimated reliably.\nPooling Arrangements. As from April 1, 2015, we began operation of the Helios Pool. Net pool revenues-related party for each vessel is determined in accordance with the profit sharing terms specified within the pool agreement for the Helios Pool. In particular, the pool manager aggregates the revenues and voyage expenses of all of the pool participants and Helios Pool general and administrative expenses and distributes the net earnings to participants based on:\nThe following table compares revenues for the year ended March 31, 2015 as compared to the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014:\nVessel Operating Expenses\nOther income -related parties amounted to $1.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $1.8 million from $0.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to $1.4 million of fees for commercial management services provided by Dorian LPG (UK) Ltd. to the Helios Pool as well an increase of $0.5 million for certain chartering and marine operation services provided by Dorian LPG (USA) LLC and its subsidiaries to DHSA.\nBeginning July 1, 2014, we ceased to incur these related-party management fees as a result of the completion of the Transition Agreements described above in Important Financial and Operational Terms and Concepts-Management Fees-Related Party.\u201d Management fees expensed for the year ended March 31, 2015 represent fees charged by DHSA amounting to approximately $1.1 million in accordance with our management agreements entered into with DHSA. The management fees were charged on a monthly basis per vessel and the total fees were affected by the number of vessels in our fleet. No management fees-related party were incurred during the year ended March 31, 2016.\nDHSA. DHSA provided the financial, strategic, technical, crew and commercial management as well as insurance and accounting services to the vessel owning subsidiaries for a fee of $93,750 per vessel per month payable one month in advance effective from July 29, 2013 through June 30, 2014. Prior to July 29, 2013, our Predecessor paid a fixed monthly management fee of $40,000 per VLGC and $32,000 for our 5,000 cbm PGC. Eagle Ocean Transport Inc., or Eagle Ocean, and Highbury Shipping Services Limited, or Highbury also provided commercial and strategic services to the Predecessor. Mr. John Hadjipateras, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, owns 100% of Eagle Ocean, and our Vice President of Chartering, Insurance and Legal, Nigel Grey-Turner, owns 100% of Highbury.\nRefer to Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nOur customers, either directly or through the Helios Pool, include or have included global energy companies such as Exxon, Unipec, Statoil and Shell, commodity traders such as Itochu Corporation and the Vitol Group and importers such as E1 Corp., SK Gas Co. Ltd. and Indian Oil Corporation. For the year ended March 31, 2016, the Helios Pool and one other individual charterer accounted for 70% and 12% of our total revenues, respectively. Within the Helios Pool, two charterers represented 19% and 14% of net pool revenues-related party for the year ended March 31, 2016. For the year ended March 31, 2015, five charterers represented 27%, 19%, 14%, 12% and 11% of total revenues, respectively. For the period ended March 31, 2014, three charterers represented 51%, 13% and 10% of total revenues, respectively. See Item 1A. Risk Factors-We operate exclusively in the LPG shipping industry. Due to our lack of diversification and the lack of diversification of the Helios Pool, adverse developments in the LPG shipping industry may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors-We expect to be dependent on a limited number of customers for a material part of our revenues, and failure of such customers to meet their obligations could cause us to suffer losses or negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.\u201d\nLoss on disposal of assets amounted to $1.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2016 and was primarily attributable to the sale of the Grendon. There was no loss on disposal of assets for the year ended March 31, 2015.\nVessel Revenue. Our revenues are driven primarily by the number of vessels in our fleet, the number of days during which our vessels operate and the amount of daily rates that our vessels earn under our charters, which, in turn, are affected by a number of factors, including levels of demand and supply in the LPG shipping industry; the age, condition and specifications of our vessels; the duration of our charters; the timing of when the profit sharing arrangements are earned; the amount of time that we spend positioning our vessels; the availability of our vessels, which is related to the amount of time that our vessels spend in drydock undergoing repairs and the amount of time required to perform necessary maintenance or upgrade work; and other factors affecting rates for LPG vessels.\n (3) VLGCs for which we believe, as of March 31, 2016, that the estimated fair value is lower than the VLGC's carrying value. We believe that the aggregate carrying value of these vessels exceeds their aggregate estimated fair value by $4.9 million as of March 31, 2016. However, as described above, the estimated net operating cash flows for each of the four VLGCs was higher than the carrying amount and consequently, no impairment loss was recognized. \nLoss on disposal of assets\nVoyage Expenses. Voyage expenses are all expenses unique to a particular voyage, including bunker fuel consumption, port expenses, canal fees, charter hire commissions, war risk insurance and security costs. Voyage expenses are typically paid by us under voyage charters and by the charterer under time charters. Accordingly, we generally only incur voyage expenses for our own account when performing voyage charters or during repositioning voyages between time charters for which no cargo is available or travelling to or from drydocking. We generally bear all voyage expenses under voyage charters and, as such, voyage expenses are generally greater under voyage charters than time charters. As a result, our voyage expenses may vary significantly depending on our mix of time charters and voyage charters.\nWe seek to employ our vessels in a manner that maximizes fleet utilization and earnings upside through our chartering strategy in line with our goal of maximizing shareholder value and returning capital to shareholders when appropriate, taking into account fluctuations in freight rates in the market and our own views on the direction of those rates in the future. As of March 31, 2016, eighteen of our twenty-two VLGCs were employed in the Helios Pool, which includes time charters with a term of less than two years.\nWe have elected to opt out\u201d of the extended transition period relating to the exemption from new or revised financial accounting standards under the JOBS Act and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised financial accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised financial accounting standards is irrevocable.\nWe amortize the cost of capitalized drydocking expenditures on a straight-line basis over the period through the date the next drydocking/special survey is scheduled to become due.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we will continue to consider strategic opportunities, including the acquisition of additional vessels and repurchases of our own securities. We may choose to pursue such opportunities through internal growth or joint ventures or business acquisitions. We expect to finance the purchase price of any additional future acquisitions and our operations either through internally generated funds, debt financings (public or private), the issuance of additional equity securities (public or private) or a combination of these forms of financing.\nVessel Depreciation. The cost of our vessels less their estimated residual value is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the vessels' estimated useful lives. We estimate the useful life of each of our vessels to be 25 years from the date the vessel was originally delivered from the shipyard. Based on the current market and the types of vessels we plan to purchase, we expect the residual values of our vessels will be based upon a value of approximately $400 per lightweight ton. An increase in the useful life of our vessels or in their residual value would have the effect of decreasing the annual depreciation charge and extending it into later periods. An increase in the useful life of a vessel may occur as a result of superior vessel maintenance performed, favorable ocean going and weather conditions the vessel is subjected to, superior quality of the shipbuilding or yard, or high freight market rates, which result in owners scrapping the vessels later due to the attractive cash flows. A decrease in the useful life of our vessels or in their residual value would have the effect of increasing the annual depreciation charge and possibly result in an impairment charge. A decrease in the useful life of a vessel may occur as a result of poor vessel maintenance performed, harsh ocean going and weather conditions the vessel is subjected to, or poor quality of the shipbuilding or yard. However, when regulations place limitations over the ability of a vessel to trade on a worldwide basis, we will adjust the vessel's useful life to end at the date such regulations preclude such vessel's further commercial use.\nTime Charter Equivalent Rate. Time charter equivalent rate, or TCE rate, is a measure of the average daily revenue performance of a vessel. TCE rate is a shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period-to-period changes in a shipping company's performance despite changes in the mix of charter types (such as time charters, voyage charters) under which the vessels may be employed between the periods. Our method of calculating TCE rate is to divide revenue net of voyage expenses by operating days for the relevant time period.\nForeign Currency Gain/(Loss), net\nInterest income amounted to approximately $0.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2015 derived from short term bank deposits. This amount was relatively unchanged from the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014.\nManagement Fees-Related Party\nThe Company remained substantially inactive for the period from July 1, 2013 until July 29, 2013, the date of our business combination with the Predecessor Businesses of Dorian LPG Ltd. Because we acquired three VLGC vessels during the year ended March 31, 2015 and the period from July 1, 2013 through March 31, 2014 included only eight months of active operations, we do not believe that the results of operations of the Company for the year ended March 31, 2015 and for the period July 1, 2013 through March 31, 2014 are directly comparable.\nOther income -related parties\n (2) With the exception of the Grendon as of March 31, 2015 (refer to 4 below), the carrying value of each of our vessels was lower than its estimated market value as of March 31, 2015. On an aggregate fleet basis, the estimated market value of our vessels exceeded their carrying value as of March 31, 2015 by $85.3 million. \nDepreciation and amortization was approximately $14.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2015 and mainly relates to depreciation expense for our operating vessels, which represented an increase of $7.5 million, or 112.9%, from $6.6 million for the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to $4.1 million of depreciation and amortization related to three of our ECO VLGCs that were delivered subsequent to March 31, 2014. Additionally, there was an increase of $3.4 million for the four vessels that were in our fleet during both periods resulting from an increase in calendar days from 984 during the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014 to 1,460 during the year ended March 31, 2015. Depreciation and amortization was approximately $6.6 million for the period July 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014 and mainly relates to depreciation expense for our Initial Fleet from the date of acquisition, July 29, 2013.\nLoss on Derivatives, net\nThe fair value of our interest swap agreements is also affected by changes in our own and our counterparty specific credit risk included in the discount factor. Our estimate of our counterparty's credit risk is based on the credit default swap spread of the relevant counterparty which is publicly available. The process of determining our own credit worthiness requires significant judgment in determining which source of credit risk information most closely matches our risk profile, which includes consideration of the margin we would be able to secure for future financing. A 10% increase / decrease in our own or our counterparty credit risk would not have had a significant impact on the fair value of our interest rate swaps.\nThe fair value of our interest swap agreements at the end of each period are most significantly affected by the interest rate implied by the LIBOR interest yield curve, including its relative steepness. Interest rates have experienced significant volatility in recent years in both the short and long term. While the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements are typically more sensitive to changes in short-term rates, significant changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates also materially impact our interest.\nVessel operating expenses were $47.1 million during the year ended March 31, 2016, or $8,581 per vessel per calendar day, which is calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by calendar days for the relevant time period for the vessels that were in our fleet. This was an increase of $25.8 million, or 121.7%, from $21.3 million or $10,703 per vessel per calendar day, for the year ended March 31, 2015. This increase is primarily the result of an increase of $24.0 million of vessel operating expenses attributable to sixteen of our ECO VLGCs that were delivered subsequent to March 31, 2015. Additionally, vessel operating expenses increased $1.8 million for the seven vessels that were in our fleet during both periods resulting from 2,518 calendar days during the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to 1,986 calendar days\nFor the period April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013, the combined financial statements include the accounts of the vessel owning companies of our Initial Fleet, which we refer to collectively as our Predecessor or the Predecessor Businesses. Our financial position, results of operations and cash flows reflected in our Predecessor combined financial statements are not indicative of those that would have been achieved had we operated as an independent stand-alone entity for all periods presented or of future results. As such, the results of operations for Predecessor Businesses for the period April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013 are not comparable and have been presented separately.\n\nAlso included in this report are the combined results of operations of the Predecessor Businesses of Dorian LPG Ltd. that owned and operated three VLGCs and one PGC (Captain Nicholas ML, Captain John NP, Captain Markos NL and Grendon, respectively) prior to the sale of the vessels to us, for the periods from April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013.\nImportant Financial and Operational Terms and Concepts\nDescription of Our Debt Obligations\nInterest and Finance Costs\nCompliance with New Accounting Standards\nVoyage Expenses\nVessel Operating Expenses. Vessel operating expenses are expenses that are not unique to a specific voyage. Vessel operating expenses are paid by us under each of our charter types (as we do not employ our vessels on bare boat charters). Vessel operating expenses include crew wages and related costs, the costs for lubricants, insurance, expenses relating to repairs and maintenance, the cost of spares and consumable stores, tonnage taxes and other miscellaneous expenses. Our vessel operating expenses will increase with the expansion of our fleet and are subject to change because of higher crew costs, higher insurance premiums, unexpected repair expenses and general inflation. Furthermore, we expect maintenance costs will increase as our vessels age.\nWe are required to complete a special survey for a vessel once every five years until 15 years of age and thereafter every 2.5 years and an intermediate survey every 2.5 years after the first special survey. Drydocking each vessel takes approximately 10-20 days. We spend significant amounts for scheduled drydocking (including the cost of classification society surveys) for each of our vessels.\nVoyage Charters. A voyage charter, or spot charter, is a contract for transportation of a specified cargo between two or more designated ports. This type of charter is priced on a current or \"spot\" market rate, typically on a price per ton of product carried. Under voyage charters, we are responsible for all of the voyage expenses in addition to providing the crewing and other vessel operating services. Revenues for voyage charters are more volatile as they are typically tied to prevailing market rates at the time of the voyage. Our gross revenue under voyage charters are generally higher than under comparable time charters so as to compensate us for bearing all voyage expenses. As a result, our revenue and voyage expenses may vary significantly depending on our mix of time charters and voyage charters. For the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 and for the period July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014, approximately 16.0%, 74.3% and 37.8%, respectively, of our revenue was generated pursuant to voyage charters.\nduring the year ended March 31, 2015. The decline in vessel operating expenses per vessel per calendar day during the year ended March 31, 2016 was largely due to the addition of newer vessels, which incur lower operating costs, along with a $0.5 million reduction in costs relating to the training of additional crew when compared to the year ended March 31, 2015.\nGain/(loss) on derivatives, net, amounted to a net gain of approximately $2.8 million for the period April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013. The gain on derivatives comprised a gain from the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps of $4.7 million due to an increase in forward Libor curve rates, partially offset by a realized loss of $1.9 million for the period April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013.\nVessel Operating Expenses\nDrydocking and special survey costs. We must periodically drydock each of our vessels to comply with industry standards, regulatory requirements and certifications. We are required to drydock a vessel once every five years until it reaches 15 years of age, after which we are required to drydock the applicable vessel every 2.5 years.\nDepreciation and Amortization\n\nOn April 1, 2015, Dorian and Phoenix began operations of the Helios Pool and entered into pool participation agreements for the purpose of establishing and operating, as charterer, under a variable rate time charter to be entered into with owners or disponent owners of VLGCs, a commercial pool of VLGCs whereby revenues and expenses are shared. The vessels entered into the Helios Pool may operate either in the spot market, pursuant to COAs or on time charters of two years' duration or less. As of March 31, 2016, eighteen of our twenty-two VLGCs were deployed in the Helios Pool.\n \u00b7 pool points (vessel attributes such as cargo carrying capacity, fuel consumption, and construction characteristics are taken into consideration); and \nIn addition, we performed a sensitivity analysis as of March 31, 2016, to determine the effect on recoverability of changes in daily TCE rates. The sensitivity analysis suggests that we would not incur an impairment charge on any of those four VLGCs if daily TCE rates fell by 30% compared to the 10-year historical average spot market rates. An impairment charge of approximately $4.9 million on those four VLGCs would be triggered by a reduction of 40% in the 10-year historical average spot market rates. The amount, if any, and timing of any impairment charges we may recognize in the future will depend upon then current and expected future charter rates and vessel values, which may differ materially from those used in our estimates as of March 31, 2016.\nSixteen of our ECO VLGCs were constructed by Hyundai and three of our ECO VLGCs were constructed at Daewoo. Our nineteen ECO VLGCs, which incorporate fuel efficiency and emission-reducing technologies and certain custom features, were acquired by us for an aggregate purchase price of $1.4 billion, which was financed with proceeds from the 2015 Debt Facility, proceeds from equity offerings, and cash generated from operations. These nineteen ECO VLGCs were delivered to us between July 2014 and February 2016, seventeen of which were delivered during calendar year 2015 or later.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2015 as compared to the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014\nWe did not incur any impairment charges during the year ended March 31, 2016. In the year ended March 31, 2015, we recognized an impairment loss of $1.4 million for our owned PGC vessel. This impairment loss was triggered by reductions in vessel values reflecting challenging conditions in the PGC market, and represented the difference between the carrying value and recoverable amount, being fair value.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n$100,000. Ongoing costs for compliance with environmental regulations are primarily included as part of our drydocking and classification society survey costs. We are not aware of any future regulatory changes or environmental laws that we expect to have a material impact on our current or future results of operations that we have not already considered. Please see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Company-We may incur substantial costs for the drydocking, maintenance or replacement of our vessels as they age, and, as our vessels age, the risks associated with older vessels could adversely affect our ability to obtain profitable charters.\u201d\nCash Flows\nNet cash used in investing activities of $221.4 million for the period July 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014 comprised mainly of payments for vessels and vessels under construction of $172.2 million, a net increase in restricted cash of $35.4 million, which was comprised of an increase of $71.0 million from the original funding of the account from the a private placement in July 2013 offset by a decrease of $35.6 million due to an accelerated payment of $28.4 million to the shipyard in return for a reduction in the contract price of the vessel and the scheduled payment of $7.2 million, and net payments to acquire the Predecessor Businesses of $13.7 million.\nIn the year ended March 31, 2015, we recognized an impairment loss of $1.4 million for our owned PGC vessel. This impairment loss was triggered by reductions in vessel values reflecting challenging conditions in the PGC market, and represented the difference between the carrying value and recoverable amount, being fair value. We did not incur any impairment charges during the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014.\nFor the period from April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013\nImpairment of long-lived assets. We review our vessels and other fixed assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. In addition, we compare independent appraisals to our carrying value for indicators of impairment to our vessels. When such indicators are present, an asset is tested for recoverability by comparing the estimate of future undiscounted net operating cash flows expected to be generated by the use of the asset over its remaining useful life and its eventual disposition to its carrying amount. An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value is in excess of the estimated future undiscounted net operating cash flows. The impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair market value of the asset. The new lower cost basis would result in a lower annual depreciation than before the impairment.\nVoyage expenses were approximately $3.8 million for the period April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013. Voyage expenses were comprised mainly of bunkers of $2.8 million, charter hire commissions of $0.4 million, port charges and other related expenses of $0.4 million and security costs of $0.2 million.\nIn addition, DHSA provided us with pre-delivery services for each newbuilding, which included engineering and technical support, liaising with the shipyard, and ensuring key suppliers are integrated into the production planning process for a fee of $15,000 per month for each newbuilding contract. The fees for pre-delivery services were capitalized to the cost of the vessels under construction. The management fees were charged on a monthly basis per vessel and newbuilding contract and the total fees were affected by the number of vessels in our fleet and the number of newbuilding contracts managed.\nPredecessor: Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $4.7 million for the period April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013 as a result of favorable movements in working capital.\nOverview\nWe generate revenue by providing seaborne transportation services to customers pursuant to three types of contractual relationships:\n\nVoyage expenses were approximately $22.1 million during the year ended March 31, 2015, an increase of $15.4 million, or 231.0%, from $6.7 million for the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase of $9.6 million for the four vessels that were in our fleet during both periods resulting from an increase in the number of these vessels operating in the spot market as well as employment of 1,173 operating days during the year ended March 31, 2015 compared to 941 operating days during the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. Additionally, $5.7 million of voyage expenses were attributable to three of our ECO VLGCs that were delivered subsequent to March 31, 2014. Voyage expenses during the year ended March 31, 2015 mainly related to bunkers of $15.7 million, port charges and other related expenses of $3.6 million, brokers' commissions of $1.7 million, security costs of $0.7 million and other voyage expenses of $0.4 million. Voyage expenses were approximately $6.7 million during the period July 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014 and mainly related to bunkers of $5.3 million, port charges of $0.6 million, brokers' commissions of $0.4 million, security costs of $0.3 million, and other voyage expenses of $0.1 million.\nManagement Fees-related party\nSixteen of the nineteen ECO VLGCs were delivered during the year ended March 31, 2016, and we borrowed $676.8 million in floating rate debt under the 2015 Debt Facility in connection with those deliveries. During the year we entered into four interest rate swap contracts which hedged $250 million of non-amortizing principal and $214.3 million of amortizing principal of the 2015 Debt Facility to fixed interest rates. In February 2016, we sold the Grendon, a 5,000 cbm PGC.\nForeign Currency Gain/(Loss), net\n \u00b7 news and industry reports of similar vessel sales; \noperate twenty-two VLGC carriers, including nineteen new fuel-efficient 84,000 cbm ECO VLGCs and three 82,000 cbm VLGCs.\nDaily Vessel Operating Expenses. Daily vessel operating expenses are calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by calendar days for the relevant time period.\nNet cash flow from operating activities depends upon our overall profitability, market rates for vessels employed on voyage charters, charter rates agreed to for time charters, the timing and amount of payments for drydocking expenditures and unscheduled repairs and maintenance, fluctuations in working capital balances and bunker costs.\nVoyage Expenses\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDepreciation and Amortization. We depreciate our vessels on a straight-line basis using an estimated useful life of 25 years and after considering estimated salvage values. Our Predecessor used an estimated useful life of 20 years to 25 years depending on the type of vessel.\nThe following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents provided by (used in) operating, financing and investing activities for the periods presented:\nCOAs relate to the carriage of multiple cargoes over the same route and enables the COA holder to nominate different ships to perform individual voyages. It constitutes a number of voyage charters to carry a specified amount of cargo during the term of the COA, which usually spans a number of years. All of the vessel's operating, voyage and capital costs are borne by the ship owner.\n (1) Our vessels are stated at carrying values (refer to our accounting policy in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements) and with the exception of four VLGCs as of March 31, 2016, the carrying value of each of our vessels was lower than its estimated market value as of March 31, 2016. On an aggregate fleet basis, the estimated market value of our vessels exceeded their carrying value as of March 31, 2016 by $31.3 million. No impairment was recorded during the year ended March 31, 2016 as we believe that the carrying value of our vessels is fully recoverable. \nInterest and Finance Costs\n \u00b7 pool points (vessel attributes such as cargo carrying capacity, fuel consumption, and speed are taken into consideration); and \n (1) Our interest commitment on our RBS Loan Facility is calculated based on an as assumed LIBOR rate of 0.90% (the six-month LIBOR rate as of March 31, 2016), plus the applicable margin for the respective period as per the loan agreement and the estimated net settlement of the related interest rate swaps. Our interest commitment on our 2015 Debt Facility is calculated based on an assumed LIBOR rate of 0.63% (the three-month LIBOR rate as of March 31, 2016), plus the applicable margin for the respective period as per the loan agreement and the estimated net settlement of the related interest rate swaps. \nRevenues of $289.2 million for the year ended March 31, 2016, including net pool revenues-related party, voyage charters, time charters and other revenues earned by our VLGCs and our PGC, increased $185.1 million, or 177.7%, from $104.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to $162.2 million of revenues contributed by sixteen of our newbuilding VLGCs that were delivered subsequent to March 31, 2015. Additionally, revenues contributed by VLGCs in our operating fleet during both periods increased $21.8 million resulting from employment of 2,101 operating days during the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to 1,512 operating days during the year ended March 31, 2015. The Grendon's revenues increased $1.1 million to $2.9 million on 224 operating days for the year ended March 31, 2016 from $1.8 million on 140 operating days for the year ended March 31, 2015.\nWe use a variety of financial and operational terms and concepts in the evaluation of our business and operations including the following:\nDepreciation and amortization for our fleet for the period April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013 was $4.0 million, which were comprised of depreciation of $3.9 million and amortization of deferred charges from drydock and special survey costs of approximately $0.1 million.\nVessel Operating Expenses\nPredecessor: Net cash used in financing activities amounted to $5.6 million for the period April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013 and reflects the scheduled repayments due under our long-term debt.\nFleet Utilization. We calculate fleet utilization by dividing the number of operating days during a period by the number of available days during that period. An increase in non-scheduled off-hire days would reduce our operating days, and therefore, our fleet utilization. We use fleet utilization to measure our ability to efficiently find suitable employment for our vessels.\nDepreciation and amortization was approximately $42.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $28.5 million, or 202.2%, from $14.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to $23.8 million of depreciation and amortization related to sixteen of our ECO VLGCs that were delivered subsequent to March 31, 2015. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.7 million for the six VLGCs that were in our fleet during both years resulting from an increase in VLGC calendar days from 1,621 during the year ended March 31, 2015 to 2,196 during the year ended March 31, 2016.\nInterest and finance costs amounted to $12.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $12.5 million from $0.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2015. The increase of $12.5 million during this period was mainly due to a $13.8 million increase in interest incurred on our long-term debt, amortization and other financing expenses from $3.8 million in the year ended March 31, 2015 to $17.6 million in the year ended March 31, 2016. These increases were partially offset by a $1.3 million increase in capitalized interest from $3.5 million in the year ended March 31, 2015 to $4.8 million in the year ended March 31, 2016. The average indebtedness during the year ended March 31, 2016 was $543.1 million compared to $125.9 million during the year ended March 31, 2015, reflecting debt drawdowns of $676.8 million made under our 2015 Debt Facility. The outstanding balance of our long term debt as of March 31, 2016 was $836.4 million.", "item_7_text": "For the year ended March 31, 2016, independent appraisals of four of our VLGCs had indicators of impairment in accordance with ASC 360 Property, Plant, and Equipment. We determined estimated net operating cash flows for these VLGCs by applying various assumptions regarding future time charter equivalent revenues net of commissions, operating expenses, scheduled drydockings, expected offhire and scrap values. These assumptions were based on historical data as well as future expectations. We estimated spot market rates used are based on the trailing 10-year historical average spot market rates based on average rates published by maritime industry researchers. Estimated outflows for operating expenses and drydocking expenses were based on historical and budgeted costs and were adjusted for assumed inflation. Utilization was based on our historical levels achieved in the spot market and estimates of a residual value consistent with scrap rates used in management's evaluation of scrap value. Such estimates and assumptions regarding expected net operating cash flows require considerable judgment and were based upon historical experience, financial forecasts and industry trends and conditions. Therefore, based on this analysis, we concluded that no impairment charge was necessary because we believe the vessel carrying values are recoverable. No impairment charges were recognized for the year ended March 31, 2016.\nsubsequent to March 31, 2014. Vessel operating expenses for the year ended March 31, 2015 included approximately $2.9 million relating to training of additional crew on our operating VLGC fleet in anticipation of newbuilding deliveries. The Grendon, which ended its time charter at the end of May 2014, had 140 operating days and was in drydock for 10 days for the year ended March 31, 2015. The Grendon had $2.8 million of vessel operating expenses, inclusive of $0.5 million of expenses related to repairs and maintenance, for the year ended March 31, 2015.\nVessel operating expenses were approximately $4.6 million for the period April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013, or $9,745 per calendar day.\nAlthough we measure the fair value of our derivative instruments utilizing the inputs and assumptions described above, if we were to terminate the interest rate swap agreements at the reporting date, the amount we would pay or receive to terminate the derivative instruments may differ from our estimate of fair value. If the estimated fair value differs from the actual termination amount, an adjustment to the carrying amount of the applicable derivative asset or liability would be recognized in earnings for the current period. Such adjustments could be material.\nManagement Fees-Related Party\nFor the year ended March 31, 2015, management fees-related party decreased $2.0 million, or 64.0%, from the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. Beginning July 1, 2014, we ceased to incur these related-party management fees as a result of the completion of the Transition Agreements described above in Important Financial and Operational Terms and Concepts-Management Fees-Related Party.\u201d Management fees expensed for the year ended March 31, 2015 represent fees charged by DHSA amounting to approximately $1.1 million in accordance with our management agreements entered into with DHSA. The management fees were charged on a monthly basis per vessel and the total fees were affected by the number of vessels in our fleet. Management fees expensed for the period July 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014 represent fees charged by DHSA amounting to approximately $3.0 million representing $93,750 per vessel per month and $0.1 million for Management fees relating to pre-delivery services, both in accordance with our management agreements entered into with DHSA. The management fees were charged on a monthly basis per vessel and the total fees were affected by the number of vessels in our fleet.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2016:\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $29.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $15.7 million, or 110.9%, from $14.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2015 mainly due to compensation-related increases of $8.9 million for salaries, wages and benefits (primarily due to an increase of $5.1 million relating to cash bonuses to various employees relating to the year ended March 31, 2016, as well as prior periods, were granted and expensed in the year ended March 31, 2016), $1.7 million for stock-based compensation, and $0.5 million in directors fees. Additionally, increases in conjunction with the build out of our operations amounted to $3.0 million for certain non-capitalizable costs incurred prior to vessel delivery including crew costs prior to initial voyage, $0.3 million in information technology and $1.3 million for other general and administrative expenses. During the year ended March 31, 2016, general and administrative expenses were comprised of $15.3 million of salaries and benefits (inclusive of the $3.0 million expense, approved by the board of directors in March 2016, for cash bonuses relating to the year ended March 31, 2016, and $2.1 million in cash bonuses, approved by the board of directors in May 2015, to various employees for services related to prior periods), $4.1 million of stock-based compensation, $3.4 million for certain non-capitalizable costs incurred prior to vessel delivery, $2.5 million for professional, legal, audit and accounting fees and $4.5 million of other general and administrative expenses. During the year ended March 31, 2015, general and administrative expenses were comprised of $6.4 million of salaries and benefits (inclusive of a $0.4 million accrual for statutory retirement benefits for our Greece-based employees), $2.4 million for professional, legal, audit and accounting fees, $2.3 million of stock-based compensation and $3.0 million of other general and administrative expenses.\nThe following table compares revenues for the years ended March 31:\nLoss on Derivatives, net\nVoyage Expenses\nRevenues\nInvesting Cash Flows. Net cash used in investing activities was $910.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $598.1 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2015. For the year ended March 31, 2016, net cash used in investing activities comprised mainly of $895.1 million of scheduled payments to the shipyards, supervision costs, management fees, and other capitalized costs related to newbuildings, and $17.6 million of restricted cash deposits, partially offset by $2.7 million of proceeds from asset disposals. Net cash used in investing activities of $312.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2015, comprised mainly of $314.2 million of scheduled payments to the shipyards, supervision costs, management fees, and other capitalized costs related to newbuildings, partially offset by a $2.2 million decrease in restricted cash.\nResults of Operations-Predecessor Businesses of Dorian LPG Ltd.\nOur estimates of fair market value assume that our vessels are all in good and seaworthy condition without need for repair and if inspected would be certified in class without notations of any kind. Our estimates are based on information available from various industry sources, including:\nGeneral and administrative expenses were approximately $14.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2015, an increase of $13.7 million, or 3,161.7%, from $0.4 million for the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. This increase was primarily a result of a majority of general and administrative expenses being covered under our management agreement with DHSA during the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. During the year ended March 31, 2015, general and administrative expenses were comprised of $6.4 million of salaries and benefits (inclusive of a $0.4 million accrual for statutory retirement benefits for our Greece-based employees), $2.4 million for professional, legal, audit and accounting fees, $2.3 million of stock-based compensation and $3.0 million of other general and administrative expenses. Prior to July 1, 2014, general and administrative expenses were primarily covered under our management agreement with DHSA, which terminated on June 30, 2014. Expenses not covered under the management agreement included, among others, stock-based compensation, audit and accounting fees, professional and legal fees and investor relations. As of July 1, 2014, vessel management services for our fleet was transferred from DHSA and are now provided through our wholly owned subsidiaries.\nLoss on derivatives, net was $15.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $11.8 million, or 298.5%, compared to $4.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in unrealized losses from the changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps of $10.2 million during the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the year ended March 31, 2015. Additionally, the increase is attributable to an increase of $1.6 million of realized loss due to an increase in the notional debt amounts during the year ended March 31, 2016 compared the year ended March 31, 2015. The net loss on derivatives for the year ended March 31, 2016 was comprised of an unrealized loss of $8.9 million from the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps due mainly to changes in yield curves along with a realized loss of $6.9 million due mainly to an increase in notional debt amounts due to four new interest rate swaps we entered into during the period. For the year ended March 31, 2015, the net loss on derivatives was primarily comprised of a realized loss of $5.3 million, partially offset by an unrealized gain of $1.3 million from the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps.\nOur business is capital intensive, and our future success depends on our ability to maintain a high-quality fleet. As of March 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $46.4 million and restricted cash of $50.8 million.\nOur primary sources of capital during the year ended March 31, 2016 was $676.8 million of proceeds from the 2015 Debt Facility that we used to make the final payments for our sixteen ECO VLGCs delivered during the year ended March 31, 2016 and $151.0 million in cash generated from operations during the year ended March 31, 2016. As of March 31, 2016, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $836.4 million and within the next twelve months, $66.3 million of principal on our long-term debt is scheduled to be repaid.\nIn addition, pursuant to the Transition Agreements, each of DHSA, Eagle Ocean, and Highbury transferred a certain number of employees and selected assets to our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Subsequent to the Transition Agreements, Eagle Ocean continues to incur travel-related costs for certain transitioned employees as well as office-related costs. We reimbursed Eagle Ocean $0.8 million and $0.7 million at cost for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n \u00b7 offers that we may have received from potential purchasers of our vessels; and \nInterest and Finance Costs\nRevenues of $15.4 million for the period April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013 represent charter hire and voyage charters earned for three VLGC vessels and one PGC vessel. Revenues from time charter hire earned for two VLGC vessels and one PGC vessel amounted to $9.2 million, of which $2.7 million represented profit sharing. Revenues from voyage charter for one VLGC vessel amounted to $6.2 million for the period April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013.\nOn August 5, 2015, we publicly announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of our common stock on or before December 31, 2016. As of March 31, 2016, we repurchased a total of 1,932,465 shares of our common stock for approximately $20.9 million under this program, resulting in $79.1 million of available authorization remaining.\nITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOperating Days. We define operating days as available days less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off-hire for any reason other than scheduled maintenance. We use operating days to measure the number of days in a period that our operating vessels are on hire.\nThe LIBOR interest rate yield curve and our specific credit risk are expected to vary over the life of the interest rate swap agreements. The larger the notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements outstanding and the longer the remaining duration of the interest rate swap agreements, the larger the impact of any variability in these factors will be on the fair value of our interest rate swaps. We economically hedge the interest rate exposure on a significant amount of our long-term debt and for long durations. As such, we have experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, material variations in the period-to-period fair value of our derivative instruments.\nRevenues\nFor the year ended March 31, 2016, approximately 70.2% of our revenue was generated through the Helios Pool as net pool revenues-related party. There were no revenues generated through pooling arrangements for the year ended March 31, 2015 and for the period July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014.\nOperating expenses, including to maintain the quality of our vessels, comply with international shipping standards and environmental laws and regulations and fund working capital requirements, long-term debt repayments, financing costs, including the repayment of principal and interest under our debt facilities, and repurchases of our own securities represent our short-term, medium-term and long-term liquidity needs as of March 31, 2016. We anticipate satisfying these needs with cash on hand, cash from operations and/or debt financings.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $493.3 million for the period July 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014 and consisted of cash proceeds from three private placements of common shares totaling $510.5 million, offset partially by repayments of long term debt of $6.5 million, payment of financing costs of $1.5 million and payments relating to equity issuance costs of $9.2 million.\nContractual Obligations\nAs our vessels age and our fleet expands, our drydocking expenses will increase. We estimate the current cost of a VLGC special survey to be approximately $1,000,000 and the cost of an intermediate survey to be approximately\nWe intend to pursue a balanced chartering strategy by employing our vessels on a mix of multi-year time charters, some of which may include a profit-sharing component, shorter-term time charters, spot market voyages and COAs. Six of our vessels are currently on fixed time charters, including two vessels on fixed time charter within the Helios Pool. See Item 1. Business-Our Fleet\u201d above for more information.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nAvailable Days. We define available days as calendar days less aggregate off-hire days associated with scheduled maintenance, which include major repairs, drydockings, vessel upgrades or special or intermediate surveys. We use available days to measure the aggregate number of days in a period that our vessels should be capable of generating revenues.\nA spot market voyage charter is generally a contract to carry a specific cargo from a load port to a discharge port for an agreed upon freight per ton of cargo or a specified total amount. Under spot market voyage charters, we pay voyage expenses such as port and fuel costs. A time charter is generally a contract to charter a vessel for a fixed period of time at a set daily or monthly rate. Under time charters, the charterer pays voyage expenses such as port and fuel costs. Vessels operating on time charters provide more predictable cash flows, but can yield lower profit margins than vessels operating in the spot market during periods characterized by favorable market conditions. Vessels operating in the spot market generate revenues that are less predictable but may enable us to capture increased profit margins during periods of improvements in tanker rates although we are exposed to the risk of declining tanker rates and lower utilization. Pools generally consist of a number of vessels which may be owned by a number of different ship owners which operate as a single marketing entity in an effort to produce freight efficiencies. Pools typically employ experienced commercial charterers and operators who have close working relationships with customers and brokers while technical management is typically the responsibility of each ship owner. Under pool arrangements, vessels typically enter the pool under a time charter agreement whereby the cost of bunkers and port expenses are borne by the charterer (i.e., the pool) and operating costs, including crews, maintenance and insurance are typically paid by the owner of the vessel. Pools, in return, typically negotiate charters with customers primarily in the spot market. Since the members of a pool typically share in the revenue generated by the entire group of vessels in the pool, and since pools operate primarily in the spot market, including the pools in which we participate, the revenue earned by vessels placed in spot market related pools is subject to the fluctuations of the spot market and the ability of the pool manager to effectively charter its fleet. We believe that vessel pools can provide cost-effective commercial management activities for a group of similar class vessels and potentially result in lower waiting times.\n \u00b7 number of days the vessel participated in the Helios Pool in the period. We recognize pool revenue on a monthly basis, when the vessel has participated in the Helios Pool during the period and the amount of pool revenue for the month can be estimated reliably. We receive estimated vessel earnings based on the known number of days the vessel has participated in the Helios Pool, the contract terms, and the estimated monthly pool revenue. We receive a report from the Helios Pool which identifies the number of days the vessel participated in the Helios Pool, the total pool points for the period, the total net pool revenues-related party for the period, and the calculated share of pool revenue for the vessel. We review the report for consistency with each vessel's pool agreement and vessel management records. \n\nInterest and finance costs amounted to approximately $0.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2015, a decrease of $1.3 million, or 81.7%, from $1.6 million for the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. This decrease was primarily a result of a larger percentage of our interest costs being capitalized to our newbuilding vessels during the year ended March 31, 2015 compared to the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. The interest and finance costs for the year ended March 31, 2015 consisted of interest incurred on our long-term debt of $2.7 million, amortization of financing costs of $0.8 million, and $0.3 million of other financing expenses, less capitalized interest of $3.5 million. The average indebtedness during the year ended March 31, 2015 was $125.9 million and the outstanding balance of our long-term debt as of March 31, 2015 was $200.3 million, which included $81.2 million under the 2015 Debt Facility. Interest and finance costs amounted to approximately $1.6 million for the period July 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014. The interest and finance costs consisted of interest incurred on our long-term debt of $1.7 million, amortization of financing costs of $0.8 million and $0.1 million of other financing costs less capitalized interest of $1.0 million. The average indebtedness during the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014 was $132.6 million and the outstanding balance of our long-term debt as of March 31, 2014, was $128.7 million.\nVessel operating expenses were approximately $21.3 million during the year ended March 31, 2015, or $10,703 per vessel per calendar day, which is calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by calendar days for the relevant time period. This was an increase of $12.9 million, or 153.2%, from $8.4 million, or $8,531 per vessel per calendar day, for the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase of $6.7 million for the four vessels that were in our fleet during both periods resulting from 1,460 calendar days during the year ended March 31, 2015 compared to 984 calendar days during the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. Additionally, $6.2 million of vessel operating expenses attributable to three of our ECO VLGCs that were delivered\nOther Revenues. Other revenues represents income from charterers, including the Helios Pool, relating to reimbursement of expenses such as costs for security guards and war risk insurance for voyages operating high risk areas. For the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 and for the period July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014, approximately 0.4%, 0.6% and 2.8%, respectively, of our revenue was generated pursuant to other revenues.\nThe table set forth below indicates the carrying value of each owned vessel in our fleet as of March 31, 2016 and 2015 at which times none of the vessels listed in the table below were being held for sale:\nInterest Income\nImpairment\nFor the year ended March 31, 2016, nineteen of our VLGCs operated within the Helios Pool, including one VLGC that left the Helios Pool to begin a long-term time charter in July 2015, and our VLGCs with the Helios Pool earned net pool revenues-related party of $202.9 million. Four of our VLGCs operated in the spot market outside of the Helios Pool and earned $43.3 million in voyage charter revenues and four of our VLGCs earned time charter revenues amounting to $38.7 million during the year ended March 31, 2016. For the year ended March 31, 2015, four of our VLGCs operated in the spot market and earned $76.1 million in voyage charter revenues, and three of our VLGCs earned time charter revenues during the period amounting to $25.5 million, including a VLGC that ended its time charter on July 27, 2014. Time charter revenues included $7.8 million of profit sharing for the year ended March 31, 2015.\nPredecessor: Net cash used in investing activities was $0.1 million for the period from April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013 as a result of payments for vessel improvements.\nWe are a Marshall Islands corporation, headquartered in the United States, focused on owning and operating very large gas carriers, or VLGCs, each with a cargo-carrying capacity of greater than 80,000 cbm. We currently own and\nRevenues\nNet pool revenues-related party. Net pool revenues-related party for each vessel in the pool is determined in accordance with the profit sharing terms specified within the pool agreement. In particular, the pool manager calculates the net pool revenues using gross revenues less voyage expenses of all the pool vessels and less the general and administrative expenses of the pool and distributes the net pool revenues as time charter hire to participants based on:\nFor the year ended March 31, 2015, an independent appraisal of our PGC vessel indicated impairment and, therefore, we determined estimated net operating cash flows for our PGC vessel by applying the above methodology with the exception of utilizing 6-year historical average spot market rates. Management believes the use of estimates based on the 6-year historical average rates calculated as of the reporting date was reasonable for our PGC vessel as the vessel had a remaining useful life of six years. We recognized an impairment loss of $1.4 million for our PGC vessel to its fair value of $4.0 million, which resulted from the prolonged market weaknesses continuing into the fourth fiscal quarter in the year ended March 31, 2015, in the market for shipping petro-chemical gases, an important trade for PGC vessels. Sales of similarly aged PGC vessels reflected the market weaknesses and the impending newbuilding PGC vessels entering the global fleet.\nFair Value of Derivative Instruments. We use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risks. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements is the estimated amount that we would receive or pay to terminate the agreements at the reporting date, taking into account current interest rates and the current credit worthiness of both us and the swap counterparties. The estimated amount is the present value of estimated future cash flows, being equal to the difference between the benchmark interest rate and the fixed rate in the interest rate swap agreement, multiplied by the notional principal amount of the interest rate swap agreement at each interest reset date\n \u00b7 reports by industry analysts and data providers that focus on our industry and related dynamics affecting vessel values; \nto be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties. For a description of our material accounting policies, please read Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nSee Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our debt obligations.\nResults of Operations -Dorian LPG Ltd.\nDrydocking costs are accounted under the deferral method whereby the actual costs incurred are deferred and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the period through the date the next drydocking is scheduled to become due. Costs deferred include expenditures incurred relating to shipyard costs, hull preparation and painting, inspection of hull structure and mechanical components, steelworks, machinery works, and electrical works. Drydocking costs do not include vessel operating expenses such as replacement parts, crew expenses, provisions, luboil consumption, insurance, management fees or management costs during the drydock period. Expenses related to regular maintenance and repairs of our vessels are expensed as incurred, even if such maintenance and repair occurs during the same time period as our drydocking.\nDrydocking. We must periodically drydock each of our vessels for any major repairs and maintenance and for inspection of the underwater parts of the vessel that cannot be performed while the vessels are operating and for any modifications to comply with industry certification or governmental requirements. We are required to drydock a vessel once every five years until it reaches fifteen years of age and thereafter every 2.5 years. We capitalize costs associated with the drydockings and amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the period through the date the next survey is scheduled to become due under the \"Deferral\" method permitted under U.S. GAAP. Costs incurred during the drydocking period which relate to routine repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The number of drydockings undertaken in a given period and the nature of the work performed determine the level of drydocking expenditures.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nIf a drydocking is performed prior to the scheduled date, the remaining unamortized balances are immediately written off. Unamortized balances of vessels that are sold are written-off and included in the calculation of the resulting gain or loss in the period of the vessel's sale. The nature of the work performed and the number of drydockings undertaken in a given period determine the level of drydocking expenditures.\nRevenues of $104.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2015 represent time charter and voyage charters earned for our six VLGC vessels and our PGC, an increase of $74.5 million, or 251.4%, from $29.6 million for the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase of $42.6 million contributed by the four vessels that were in our fleet during both periods resulting from increases in charter rates and the number of these vessels operating in the spot market, as well as employment of 1,173 operating days during the year ended March 31, 2015 compared to 941 operating days during the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. Additionally, $31.9 million of revenues were contributed by three of our ECO VLGCs that were delivered subsequent to March 31, 2014. For the year ended March 31, 2015, four of our VLGCs operated in the spot market and earned $76.1 million in voyage charter revenues. Three of our VLGCs earned time charter revenues during the period amounting to $25.5 million, including a VLGC that ended its time charter on July 27, 2014. Time charter revenues included $7.8 million of profit sharing. For the year ended March 31, 2015, the Grendon, whose time charter expired at the end of May 2014, earned $1.8 million of revenues, had 140 operating days and was in drydock for 10 days. Revenues of $29.6 million for the period July 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014 represent charter hire and voyage charters earned for our three VLGC vessels and our PGC. Revenues from time charter hire earned for our two VLGC vessels and the Grendon amounted to $17.8 million, of which $6.1 million represented profit sharing, and revenues from voyage charter for one VLGC vessel amounted to $11.8 million. The Captain Nicholas ML was in drydock for the period from August 28, 2013 to September 14, 2013 and did not earn revenue during this time.\nOperating Cash Flows. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2016 amounted to $151.0 million compared with $25.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2015. The increase primarily reflects higher earnings and was driven by an increase in our number of vessels from seven as of March 31, 2015, to twenty-two as of March 31, 2016, as well as an increase in our time charter equivalent rate from $49,665 during the year ended March 31, 2015, to $55,087 during the year ended March 31, 2016.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the period July 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014 amounted to $7.2 million, primarily as a result of our operating profits, net of non-cash adjustments to net income, which were offset partially by payments for drydocking costs of $0.4 million.\nPursuant to transition agreements that became effective on July 1, 2014, or the Transition Agreements, we pay no further management or pre-delivery services fees to DHSA and we have transitioned all management functions to our wholly-owned subsidiaries Dorian LPG Management Corp., Dorian LPG (USA) LLC, and Dorian LPG (UK) Ltd. as of July 1, 2014. Subsequent to the completion of this transition, no fees for such services are paid to any related parties and no consideration is payable by us to DHSA.\nOur dividend policy will also impact our future liquidity position. Marshall Islands law generally prohibits the payment of dividends other than from surplus or while a company is insolvent or would be rendered insolvent by the payment of such a dividend. In addition, under the terms of our credit facilities, we may only declare or pay any dividends from our free cash flow and may not do so if i) an event of default is occurring or ii) the payment of such dividend would result in an event of default. Our vessel owning subsidiaries who are party to the RBS Loan Facility, as described in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements, are prohibited from paying dividends without the consent of the lender.\nOn April 1, 2015, Dorian and Phoenix began operation of the Helios Pool, a 50% joint venture, which is a pool of VLGC vessels. We believe that the operation of certain of our VLGCs in this pool will allow us to achieve better market coverage and utilization. Vessels entered into the Helios Pool are commercially managed jointly by Dorian LPG (UK) Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary, and Phoenix. The members of the Helios Pool share in the net pool revenues generated by the entire group of vessels in the pool, weighted according to certain technical vessel characteristics, and net pool revenues (see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements) are distributed as variable rate time charter hire to each participant. The vessels entered into the Helios Pool may operate either in the spot market, COAs, or on time charters of two years' duration or less. In March 2016, the Helios Pool reached an agreement with Oriental Energy, one of the largest propane dehydrogenation plant operators and importers in China to operate eight VLGCs on its behalf. As of May 26, 2016, the Helios Pool operated twenty-four VLGCs, including eighteen of our vessels, four Phoenix vessels, and two Oriental Energy vessels. When fully delivered, the Helios Pool will operate six additional VLGCs for Oriental Energy, some of which will be time chartered-in at a fixed time charter hire rate. In addition, the Helios Pool has entered into a COA with Oriental Energy covering its shipments from the United States Gulf, which gives us exposure to the growing Chinese LPG market.\nTime Charters. A time charter is a contract under which a vessel is chartered for a defined period of time at a fixed daily or monthly rate. Under time charters, we are responsible for providing crewing and other vessel operating services, the cost of which is intended to be covered by the fixed rate, while the customer is responsible for substantially all of the voyage expenses, including bunker fuel consumption, port expenses and canal tolls. LPG is typically transported under a time charter arrangement, with terms ranging up to seven years. In addition, we may also have profit sharing arrangements with some of our customers that provide for additional payments above a floor monthly rate (usually up to an agreed ceiling) based on the actual, average daily rate quoted by the Baltic Exchange for Very Large Gas Carriers on the benchmark Ras Tanura-Chiba route over an agreed time period converted to a Time Charter Equivalent monthly rate. For the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 and for the period July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014, approximately 13.4%, 25.1% and 59.4%, respectively, of our revenue was generated pursuant to time charters from our VLGCs not in the Helios Pool.\n \u00b7 vessel sale prices and values of which we are aware through both formal and informal communications with shipowners, shipbrokers, industry analysts and various other shipping industry participants and observers. \nManagement Fees-Related Party. Management fees to related parties ceased on June 30, 2014. They were paid pursuant to management agreements entered into by each vessel owning subsidiary with Dorian (Hellas) S.A., or\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses principally consist of the costs incurred in the corporate administration of the vessel and non-vessel owning subsidiaries. Beginning July 1, 2014, we ceased to incur related-party management fees as a result of the completion of the Transaction Agreements described above under \"Management Fees-Related Party.\" In June 2014, we granted 655,000 restricted stock awards to certain of our officers and in March 2015, we granted 274,000 restricted stock awards to certain of our directors, employees and non-employee consultants (see Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters\u201d) that vest over five years. Granting of restricted stock results in an increase in expenses. Compensation expense for employees is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the awards and is recognized over the vesting period and for nonemployees is re-measured at the end of each reporting period based on the estimated fair value of the awards on that date and is recognized over the vesting period.\nThe following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents provided by (used in) operating, financing and investing activities of our predecessor for the period presented:\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates in the application of our accounting policies based on our best assumptions, judgments and opinions. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. Accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider\nDepreciation and Amortization\nForeign currency gain/(loss), net amounted to a net loss of approximately $0.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2016. This was a decrease in the loss of $0.7 million, or 65.7%, compared to a loss of $1.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to unrealized losses from cash held in Norwegian Krone during the year ended March 31, 2015 that did not recur during the year ended March 31, 2016.\nForeign currency gain/(loss), net amounted to a net loss of approximately $1.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2015, and comprised mainly of unrealized losses from cash held in Norwegian Krone. This was a decrease of $1.7 million compared to the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. Foreign currency gain/(loss), net amounted to a net gain approximately $0.7 million for the period July 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014, and were comprised mainly of realized gains of $1.9 million from payments in U.S. dollars received in advance of the closing of the November 26, 2013 equity private placement transactions priced in Norwegian Krone and converted to U.S. dollars, partially offset by realized losses of $1.2 million from payments in U.S. dollars received in advance of the closing of the February 12, 2014 equity private placement transactions priced in Norwegian Krone and converted to U.S. dollars.\nAs we obtain information from various industry and other sources, our estimates of fair market value are inherently uncertain. In addition, vessel values are highly volatile; as such, our estimates may not be indicative of the current or future fair market value of our vessels or prices that we could achieve if we were to sell them.\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated and our Predecessor Businesses' combined financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. Among other things, those financial statements include more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following information. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are presented in U.S. Dollars unless otherwise indicated. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth under \"Item 1A - Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in this report, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. Please see the section \"Forward-Looking Statements\" elsewhere in this report.\nFinancing Cash Flows. Net cash provided by financing activities was $601.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2016 an increase of $387.4 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2015. For the year ended March 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities consisted of $676.8 million of borrowings related to our 2015 Debt Facility partially offset by repayments of long term debt of $40.8 million, treasury stock repurchases of $20.9 million and debt financing costs of $14.0 million. Net cash provided by financing activities was $213.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2015 and consisted of cash proceeds from our initial public offering, the overallotment exercise by the underwriters of our initial public offering, and a private placement of our common stock, together totaling $155.8 million, and $80.1 million in cash proceeds from borrowings related to our 2015 Debt Facility offset partially by debt financing costs of $11.2 million, repayments of long term debt of $9.6 million and payment of equity issuance costs of $1.4 million.\nVoyage expenses were $12.1 million during the year ended March 31, 2016 a decrease of $10.0 million, or 45.4%, from $22.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2015. The decrease was mainly attributable to a decrease in the number of vessels operating on voyage charters as a result of vessels operating in the Helios Pool as well as decreases in fuel prices. These decreases resulted in decreases in bunker costs of $8.4 million, port expenses of $1.0 million and other voyage expenses of $0.6 million. Voyage expenses during the year ended March 31, 2016 mainly related to bunkers of $7.2 million, port charges and other related expenses of $2.6 million, brokers' commissions of $1.3 million, security costs of $0.4 million and other voyage expenses of $0.6 million. Voyage expenses during the year ended March 31, 2015 mainly related to bunkers of $15.7 million, port charges and other related expenses of $3.6 million, brokers' commissions of $1.7 million, security costs of $0.7 million and other voyage expenses of $0.4 million.\nInterest and finance costs amounted to approximately $0.8 million for the period April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013 primarily relating to the interest incurred on long-term debt.\n\nCalendar Days. We define calendar days as the total number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet was owned. Calendar days are an indicator of the size of the fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of expenses that are recorded during that period.\nManagement fees charged by DHSA for the period April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013 were approximately $0.6 million relating to fees of $40,000 per VLGC vessel per month and $32,000 for the PGC vessel per month.\nImpairment\nWe currently do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nVessel Deployment-Spot Voyages, Time Charters, COAs, and Pooling Arrangements\nCapital Expenditures. LPG transportation is a capital-intensive business, requiring significant investment to maintain an efficient fleet and to stay in regulatory compliance.\n \u00b7 number of days the vessel participated in the pool in the period. \nGain/(Loss) on Derivatives, net\nDepreciation and Amortization\n (4) During the year ended March 31, 2015, an impairment loss was taken on the Grendon of $1.4 million and the carrying value was written down to $4.0 million. The Grendon was sold in February 2016 and had no carrying value as of March 31, 2016. \nFor the year ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2015\nLoss on derivatives, net, was $4.0 million for year ended March 31, 2015, an increase of $2.9 million, or 258.6%, from a net loss of approximately $1.1 million for the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase of $1.6 million of realized loss due to a higher number of days in the year ended March 31, 2015 compared to the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. Additionally, the unrealized gain from the changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps decreased $1.3 million during the year ended March 31, 2015 compared to the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. For the year ended March 31, 2015, the net loss on derivatives of approximately $4.0 million was primarily comprised of a realized loss of $5.3 million, partially offset by an unrealized gain of $1.3 million from the changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps. For the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014, net loss on derivatives of approximately $1.1 million comprised of a realized loss of $3.7 million, partially offset by an unrealized gain of $2.6 million from the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps.\n \u00b7 approximate market values for our vessels or similar vessels that we have received from shipbrokers, whether solicited or unsolicited, or that shipbrokers have generally disseminated; \n (2) Our United Kingdom and Greece office lease payments were translated into U.S. Dollars using foreign currency equivalent rates of British Pound Sterling 1.44 and Euro 1.14, respectively, as of March 31, 2016. \nWe recognize net pool revenues-related party on a monthly basis, when the vessel has participated in the pool during the period and the amount of net pool revenues for the month can be estimated reliably.\nPooling Arrangements. As from April 1, 2015, we began operation of the Helios Pool. Net pool revenues-related party for each vessel is determined in accordance with the profit sharing terms specified within the pool agreement for the Helios Pool. In particular, the pool manager aggregates the revenues and voyage expenses of all of the pool participants and Helios Pool general and administrative expenses and distributes the net earnings to participants based on:\nThe following table compares revenues for the year ended March 31, 2015 as compared to the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014:\nVessel Operating Expenses\nOther income -related parties amounted to $1.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $1.8 million from $0.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to $1.4 million of fees for commercial management services provided by Dorian LPG (UK) Ltd. to the Helios Pool as well an increase of $0.5 million for certain chartering and marine operation services provided by Dorian LPG (USA) LLC and its subsidiaries to DHSA.\nBeginning July 1, 2014, we ceased to incur these related-party management fees as a result of the completion of the Transition Agreements described above in Important Financial and Operational Terms and Concepts-Management Fees-Related Party.\u201d Management fees expensed for the year ended March 31, 2015 represent fees charged by DHSA amounting to approximately $1.1 million in accordance with our management agreements entered into with DHSA. The management fees were charged on a monthly basis per vessel and the total fees were affected by the number of vessels in our fleet. No management fees-related party were incurred during the year ended March 31, 2016.\nDHSA. DHSA provided the financial, strategic, technical, crew and commercial management as well as insurance and accounting services to the vessel owning subsidiaries for a fee of $93,750 per vessel per month payable one month in advance effective from July 29, 2013 through June 30, 2014. Prior to July 29, 2013, our Predecessor paid a fixed monthly management fee of $40,000 per VLGC and $32,000 for our 5,000 cbm PGC. Eagle Ocean Transport Inc., or Eagle Ocean, and Highbury Shipping Services Limited, or Highbury also provided commercial and strategic services to the Predecessor. Mr. John Hadjipateras, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, owns 100% of Eagle Ocean, and our Vice President of Chartering, Insurance and Legal, Nigel Grey-Turner, owns 100% of Highbury.\nRefer to Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nOur customers, either directly or through the Helios Pool, include or have included global energy companies such as Exxon, Unipec, Statoil and Shell, commodity traders such as Itochu Corporation and the Vitol Group and importers such as E1 Corp., SK Gas Co. Ltd. and Indian Oil Corporation. For the year ended March 31, 2016, the Helios Pool and one other individual charterer accounted for 70% and 12% of our total revenues, respectively. Within the Helios Pool, two charterers represented 19% and 14% of net pool revenues-related party for the year ended March 31, 2016. For the year ended March 31, 2015, five charterers represented 27%, 19%, 14%, 12% and 11% of total revenues, respectively. For the period ended March 31, 2014, three charterers represented 51%, 13% and 10% of total revenues, respectively. See Item 1A. Risk Factors-We operate exclusively in the LPG shipping industry. Due to our lack of diversification and the lack of diversification of the Helios Pool, adverse developments in the LPG shipping industry may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors-We expect to be dependent on a limited number of customers for a material part of our revenues, and failure of such customers to meet their obligations could cause us to suffer losses or negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.\u201d\nLoss on disposal of assets amounted to $1.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2016 and was primarily attributable to the sale of the Grendon. There was no loss on disposal of assets for the year ended March 31, 2015.\nVessel Revenue. Our revenues are driven primarily by the number of vessels in our fleet, the number of days during which our vessels operate and the amount of daily rates that our vessels earn under our charters, which, in turn, are affected by a number of factors, including levels of demand and supply in the LPG shipping industry; the age, condition and specifications of our vessels; the duration of our charters; the timing of when the profit sharing arrangements are earned; the amount of time that we spend positioning our vessels; the availability of our vessels, which is related to the amount of time that our vessels spend in drydock undergoing repairs and the amount of time required to perform necessary maintenance or upgrade work; and other factors affecting rates for LPG vessels.\n (3) VLGCs for which we believe, as of March 31, 2016, that the estimated fair value is lower than the VLGC's carrying value. We believe that the aggregate carrying value of these vessels exceeds their aggregate estimated fair value by $4.9 million as of March 31, 2016. However, as described above, the estimated net operating cash flows for each of the four VLGCs was higher than the carrying amount and consequently, no impairment loss was recognized. \nLoss on disposal of assets\nVoyage Expenses. Voyage expenses are all expenses unique to a particular voyage, including bunker fuel consumption, port expenses, canal fees, charter hire commissions, war risk insurance and security costs. Voyage expenses are typically paid by us under voyage charters and by the charterer under time charters. Accordingly, we generally only incur voyage expenses for our own account when performing voyage charters or during repositioning voyages between time charters for which no cargo is available or travelling to or from drydocking. We generally bear all voyage expenses under voyage charters and, as such, voyage expenses are generally greater under voyage charters than time charters. As a result, our voyage expenses may vary significantly depending on our mix of time charters and voyage charters.\nWe seek to employ our vessels in a manner that maximizes fleet utilization and earnings upside through our chartering strategy in line with our goal of maximizing shareholder value and returning capital to shareholders when appropriate, taking into account fluctuations in freight rates in the market and our own views on the direction of those rates in the future. As of March 31, 2016, eighteen of our twenty-two VLGCs were employed in the Helios Pool, which includes time charters with a term of less than two years.\nWe have elected to opt out\u201d of the extended transition period relating to the exemption from new or revised financial accounting standards under the JOBS Act and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised financial accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised financial accounting standards is irrevocable.\nWe amortize the cost of capitalized drydocking expenditures on a straight-line basis over the period through the date the next drydocking/special survey is scheduled to become due.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we will continue to consider strategic opportunities, including the acquisition of additional vessels and repurchases of our own securities. We may choose to pursue such opportunities through internal growth or joint ventures or business acquisitions. We expect to finance the purchase price of any additional future acquisitions and our operations either through internally generated funds, debt financings (public or private), the issuance of additional equity securities (public or private) or a combination of these forms of financing.\nVessel Depreciation. The cost of our vessels less their estimated residual value is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the vessels' estimated useful lives. We estimate the useful life of each of our vessels to be 25 years from the date the vessel was originally delivered from the shipyard. Based on the current market and the types of vessels we plan to purchase, we expect the residual values of our vessels will be based upon a value of approximately $400 per lightweight ton. An increase in the useful life of our vessels or in their residual value would have the effect of decreasing the annual depreciation charge and extending it into later periods. An increase in the useful life of a vessel may occur as a result of superior vessel maintenance performed, favorable ocean going and weather conditions the vessel is subjected to, superior quality of the shipbuilding or yard, or high freight market rates, which result in owners scrapping the vessels later due to the attractive cash flows. A decrease in the useful life of our vessels or in their residual value would have the effect of increasing the annual depreciation charge and possibly result in an impairment charge. A decrease in the useful life of a vessel may occur as a result of poor vessel maintenance performed, harsh ocean going and weather conditions the vessel is subjected to, or poor quality of the shipbuilding or yard. However, when regulations place limitations over the ability of a vessel to trade on a worldwide basis, we will adjust the vessel's useful life to end at the date such regulations preclude such vessel's further commercial use.\nTime Charter Equivalent Rate. Time charter equivalent rate, or TCE rate, is a measure of the average daily revenue performance of a vessel. TCE rate is a shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period-to-period changes in a shipping company's performance despite changes in the mix of charter types (such as time charters, voyage charters) under which the vessels may be employed between the periods. Our method of calculating TCE rate is to divide revenue net of voyage expenses by operating days for the relevant time period.\nForeign Currency Gain/(Loss), net\nInterest income amounted to approximately $0.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2015 derived from short term bank deposits. This amount was relatively unchanged from the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014.\nManagement Fees-Related Party\nThe Company remained substantially inactive for the period from July 1, 2013 until July 29, 2013, the date of our business combination with the Predecessor Businesses of Dorian LPG Ltd. Because we acquired three VLGC vessels during the year ended March 31, 2015 and the period from July 1, 2013 through March 31, 2014 included only eight months of active operations, we do not believe that the results of operations of the Company for the year ended March 31, 2015 and for the period July 1, 2013 through March 31, 2014 are directly comparable.\nOther income -related parties\n (2) With the exception of the Grendon as of March 31, 2015 (refer to 4 below), the carrying value of each of our vessels was lower than its estimated market value as of March 31, 2015. On an aggregate fleet basis, the estimated market value of our vessels exceeded their carrying value as of March 31, 2015 by $85.3 million. \nDepreciation and amortization was approximately $14.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2015 and mainly relates to depreciation expense for our operating vessels, which represented an increase of $7.5 million, or 112.9%, from $6.6 million for the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to $4.1 million of depreciation and amortization related to three of our ECO VLGCs that were delivered subsequent to March 31, 2014. Additionally, there was an increase of $3.4 million for the four vessels that were in our fleet during both periods resulting from an increase in calendar days from 984 during the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014 to 1,460 during the year ended March 31, 2015. Depreciation and amortization was approximately $6.6 million for the period July 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014 and mainly relates to depreciation expense for our Initial Fleet from the date of acquisition, July 29, 2013.\nLoss on Derivatives, net\nThe fair value of our interest swap agreements is also affected by changes in our own and our counterparty specific credit risk included in the discount factor. Our estimate of our counterparty's credit risk is based on the credit default swap spread of the relevant counterparty which is publicly available. The process of determining our own credit worthiness requires significant judgment in determining which source of credit risk information most closely matches our risk profile, which includes consideration of the margin we would be able to secure for future financing. A 10% increase / decrease in our own or our counterparty credit risk would not have had a significant impact on the fair value of our interest rate swaps.\nThe fair value of our interest swap agreements at the end of each period are most significantly affected by the interest rate implied by the LIBOR interest yield curve, including its relative steepness. Interest rates have experienced significant volatility in recent years in both the short and long term. While the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements are typically more sensitive to changes in short-term rates, significant changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates also materially impact our interest.\nVessel operating expenses were $47.1 million during the year ended March 31, 2016, or $8,581 per vessel per calendar day, which is calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by calendar days for the relevant time period for the vessels that were in our fleet. This was an increase of $25.8 million, or 121.7%, from $21.3 million or $10,703 per vessel per calendar day, for the year ended March 31, 2015. This increase is primarily the result of an increase of $24.0 million of vessel operating expenses attributable to sixteen of our ECO VLGCs that were delivered subsequent to March 31, 2015. Additionally, vessel operating expenses increased $1.8 million for the seven vessels that were in our fleet during both periods resulting from 2,518 calendar days during the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to 1,986 calendar days\nFor the period April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013, the combined financial statements include the accounts of the vessel owning companies of our Initial Fleet, which we refer to collectively as our Predecessor or the Predecessor Businesses. Our financial position, results of operations and cash flows reflected in our Predecessor combined financial statements are not indicative of those that would have been achieved had we operated as an independent stand-alone entity for all periods presented or of future results. As such, the results of operations for Predecessor Businesses for the period April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013 are not comparable and have been presented separately.\n\nAlso included in this report are the combined results of operations of the Predecessor Businesses of Dorian LPG Ltd. that owned and operated three VLGCs and one PGC (Captain Nicholas ML, Captain John NP, Captain Markos NL and Grendon, respectively) prior to the sale of the vessels to us, for the periods from April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013.\nImportant Financial and Operational Terms and Concepts\nDescription of Our Debt Obligations\nInterest and Finance Costs\nCompliance with New Accounting Standards\nVoyage Expenses\nVessel Operating Expenses. Vessel operating expenses are expenses that are not unique to a specific voyage. Vessel operating expenses are paid by us under each of our charter types (as we do not employ our vessels on bare boat charters). Vessel operating expenses include crew wages and related costs, the costs for lubricants, insurance, expenses relating to repairs and maintenance, the cost of spares and consumable stores, tonnage taxes and other miscellaneous expenses. Our vessel operating expenses will increase with the expansion of our fleet and are subject to change because of higher crew costs, higher insurance premiums, unexpected repair expenses and general inflation. Furthermore, we expect maintenance costs will increase as our vessels age.\nWe are required to complete a special survey for a vessel once every five years until 15 years of age and thereafter every 2.5 years and an intermediate survey every 2.5 years after the first special survey. Drydocking each vessel takes approximately 10-20 days. We spend significant amounts for scheduled drydocking (including the cost of classification society surveys) for each of our vessels.\nVoyage Charters. A voyage charter, or spot charter, is a contract for transportation of a specified cargo between two or more designated ports. This type of charter is priced on a current or \"spot\" market rate, typically on a price per ton of product carried. Under voyage charters, we are responsible for all of the voyage expenses in addition to providing the crewing and other vessel operating services. Revenues for voyage charters are more volatile as they are typically tied to prevailing market rates at the time of the voyage. Our gross revenue under voyage charters are generally higher than under comparable time charters so as to compensate us for bearing all voyage expenses. As a result, our revenue and voyage expenses may vary significantly depending on our mix of time charters and voyage charters. For the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 and for the period July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014, approximately 16.0%, 74.3% and 37.8%, respectively, of our revenue was generated pursuant to voyage charters.\nduring the year ended March 31, 2015. The decline in vessel operating expenses per vessel per calendar day during the year ended March 31, 2016 was largely due to the addition of newer vessels, which incur lower operating costs, along with a $0.5 million reduction in costs relating to the training of additional crew when compared to the year ended March 31, 2015.\nGain/(loss) on derivatives, net, amounted to a net gain of approximately $2.8 million for the period April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013. The gain on derivatives comprised a gain from the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps of $4.7 million due to an increase in forward Libor curve rates, partially offset by a realized loss of $1.9 million for the period April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013.\nVessel Operating Expenses\nDrydocking and special survey costs. We must periodically drydock each of our vessels to comply with industry standards, regulatory requirements and certifications. We are required to drydock a vessel once every five years until it reaches 15 years of age, after which we are required to drydock the applicable vessel every 2.5 years.\nDepreciation and Amortization\n\nOn April 1, 2015, Dorian and Phoenix began operations of the Helios Pool and entered into pool participation agreements for the purpose of establishing and operating, as charterer, under a variable rate time charter to be entered into with owners or disponent owners of VLGCs, a commercial pool of VLGCs whereby revenues and expenses are shared. The vessels entered into the Helios Pool may operate either in the spot market, pursuant to COAs or on time charters of two years' duration or less. As of March 31, 2016, eighteen of our twenty-two VLGCs were deployed in the Helios Pool.\n \u00b7 pool points (vessel attributes such as cargo carrying capacity, fuel consumption, and construction characteristics are taken into consideration); and \nIn addition, we performed a sensitivity analysis as of March 31, 2016, to determine the effect on recoverability of changes in daily TCE rates. The sensitivity analysis suggests that we would not incur an impairment charge on any of those four VLGCs if daily TCE rates fell by 30% compared to the 10-year historical average spot market rates. An impairment charge of approximately $4.9 million on those four VLGCs would be triggered by a reduction of 40% in the 10-year historical average spot market rates. The amount, if any, and timing of any impairment charges we may recognize in the future will depend upon then current and expected future charter rates and vessel values, which may differ materially from those used in our estimates as of March 31, 2016.\nSixteen of our ECO VLGCs were constructed by Hyundai and three of our ECO VLGCs were constructed at Daewoo. Our nineteen ECO VLGCs, which incorporate fuel efficiency and emission-reducing technologies and certain custom features, were acquired by us for an aggregate purchase price of $1.4 billion, which was financed with proceeds from the 2015 Debt Facility, proceeds from equity offerings, and cash generated from operations. These nineteen ECO VLGCs were delivered to us between July 2014 and February 2016, seventeen of which were delivered during calendar year 2015 or later.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2015 as compared to the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014\nWe did not incur any impairment charges during the year ended March 31, 2016. In the year ended March 31, 2015, we recognized an impairment loss of $1.4 million for our owned PGC vessel. This impairment loss was triggered by reductions in vessel values reflecting challenging conditions in the PGC market, and represented the difference between the carrying value and recoverable amount, being fair value.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n$100,000. Ongoing costs for compliance with environmental regulations are primarily included as part of our drydocking and classification society survey costs. We are not aware of any future regulatory changes or environmental laws that we expect to have a material impact on our current or future results of operations that we have not already considered. Please see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Company-We may incur substantial costs for the drydocking, maintenance or replacement of our vessels as they age, and, as our vessels age, the risks associated with older vessels could adversely affect our ability to obtain profitable charters.\u201d\nCash Flows\nNet cash used in investing activities of $221.4 million for the period July 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014 comprised mainly of payments for vessels and vessels under construction of $172.2 million, a net increase in restricted cash of $35.4 million, which was comprised of an increase of $71.0 million from the original funding of the account from the a private placement in July 2013 offset by a decrease of $35.6 million due to an accelerated payment of $28.4 million to the shipyard in return for a reduction in the contract price of the vessel and the scheduled payment of $7.2 million, and net payments to acquire the Predecessor Businesses of $13.7 million.\nIn the year ended March 31, 2015, we recognized an impairment loss of $1.4 million for our owned PGC vessel. This impairment loss was triggered by reductions in vessel values reflecting challenging conditions in the PGC market, and represented the difference between the carrying value and recoverable amount, being fair value. We did not incur any impairment charges during the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014.\nFor the period from April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013\nImpairment of long-lived assets. We review our vessels and other fixed assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. In addition, we compare independent appraisals to our carrying value for indicators of impairment to our vessels. When such indicators are present, an asset is tested for recoverability by comparing the estimate of future undiscounted net operating cash flows expected to be generated by the use of the asset over its remaining useful life and its eventual disposition to its carrying amount. An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value is in excess of the estimated future undiscounted net operating cash flows. The impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair market value of the asset. The new lower cost basis would result in a lower annual depreciation than before the impairment.\nVoyage expenses were approximately $3.8 million for the period April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013. Voyage expenses were comprised mainly of bunkers of $2.8 million, charter hire commissions of $0.4 million, port charges and other related expenses of $0.4 million and security costs of $0.2 million.\nIn addition, DHSA provided us with pre-delivery services for each newbuilding, which included engineering and technical support, liaising with the shipyard, and ensuring key suppliers are integrated into the production planning process for a fee of $15,000 per month for each newbuilding contract. The fees for pre-delivery services were capitalized to the cost of the vessels under construction. The management fees were charged on a monthly basis per vessel and newbuilding contract and the total fees were affected by the number of vessels in our fleet and the number of newbuilding contracts managed.\nPredecessor: Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $4.7 million for the period April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013 as a result of favorable movements in working capital.\nOverview\nWe generate revenue by providing seaborne transportation services to customers pursuant to three types of contractual relationships:\n\nVoyage expenses were approximately $22.1 million during the year ended March 31, 2015, an increase of $15.4 million, or 231.0%, from $6.7 million for the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase of $9.6 million for the four vessels that were in our fleet during both periods resulting from an increase in the number of these vessels operating in the spot market as well as employment of 1,173 operating days during the year ended March 31, 2015 compared to 941 operating days during the period from July 1, 2013 (inception) to March 31, 2014. Additionally, $5.7 million of voyage expenses were attributable to three of our ECO VLGCs that were delivered subsequent to March 31, 2014. Voyage expenses during the year ended March 31, 2015 mainly related to bunkers of $15.7 million, port charges and other related expenses of $3.6 million, brokers' commissions of $1.7 million, security costs of $0.7 million and other voyage expenses of $0.4 million. Voyage expenses were approximately $6.7 million during the period July 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014 and mainly related to bunkers of $5.3 million, port charges of $0.6 million, brokers' commissions of $0.4 million, security costs of $0.3 million, and other voyage expenses of $0.1 million.\nManagement Fees-related party\nSixteen of the nineteen ECO VLGCs were delivered during the year ended March 31, 2016, and we borrowed $676.8 million in floating rate debt under the 2015 Debt Facility in connection with those deliveries. During the year we entered into four interest rate swap contracts which hedged $250 million of non-amortizing principal and $214.3 million of amortizing principal of the 2015 Debt Facility to fixed interest rates. In February 2016, we sold the Grendon, a 5,000 cbm PGC.\nForeign Currency Gain/(Loss), net\n \u00b7 news and industry reports of similar vessel sales; \noperate twenty-two VLGC carriers, including nineteen new fuel-efficient 84,000 cbm ECO VLGCs and three 82,000 cbm VLGCs.\nDaily Vessel Operating Expenses. Daily vessel operating expenses are calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by calendar days for the relevant time period.\nNet cash flow from operating activities depends upon our overall profitability, market rates for vessels employed on voyage charters, charter rates agreed to for time charters, the timing and amount of payments for drydocking expenditures and unscheduled repairs and maintenance, fluctuations in working capital balances and bunker costs.\nVoyage Expenses\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDepreciation and Amortization. We depreciate our vessels on a straight-line basis using an estimated useful life of 25 years and after considering estimated salvage values. Our Predecessor used an estimated useful life of 20 years to 25 years depending on the type of vessel.\nThe following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents provided by (used in) operating, financing and investing activities for the periods presented:\nCOAs relate to the carriage of multiple cargoes over the same route and enables the COA holder to nominate different ships to perform individual voyages. It constitutes a number of voyage charters to carry a specified amount of cargo during the term of the COA, which usually spans a number of years. All of the vessel's operating, voyage and capital costs are borne by the ship owner.\n (1) Our vessels are stated at carrying values (refer to our accounting policy in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements) and with the exception of four VLGCs as of March 31, 2016, the carrying value of each of our vessels was lower than its estimated market value as of March 31, 2016. On an aggregate fleet basis, the estimated market value of our vessels exceeded their carrying value as of March 31, 2016 by $31.3 million. No impairment was recorded during the year ended March 31, 2016 as we believe that the carrying value of our vessels is fully recoverable. \nInterest and Finance Costs\n \u00b7 pool points (vessel attributes such as cargo carrying capacity, fuel consumption, and speed are taken into consideration); and \n (1) Our interest commitment on our RBS Loan Facility is calculated based on an as assumed LIBOR rate of 0.90% (the six-month LIBOR rate as of March 31, 2016), plus the applicable margin for the respective period as per the loan agreement and the estimated net settlement of the related interest rate swaps. Our interest commitment on our 2015 Debt Facility is calculated based on an assumed LIBOR rate of 0.63% (the three-month LIBOR rate as of March 31, 2016), plus the applicable margin for the respective period as per the loan agreement and the estimated net settlement of the related interest rate swaps. \nRevenues of $289.2 million for the year ended March 31, 2016, including net pool revenues-related party, voyage charters, time charters and other revenues earned by our VLGCs and our PGC, increased $185.1 million, or 177.7%, from $104.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to $162.2 million of revenues contributed by sixteen of our newbuilding VLGCs that were delivered subsequent to March 31, 2015. Additionally, revenues contributed by VLGCs in our operating fleet during both periods increased $21.8 million resulting from employment of 2,101 operating days during the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to 1,512 operating days during the year ended March 31, 2015. The Grendon's revenues increased $1.1 million to $2.9 million on 224 operating days for the year ended March 31, 2016 from $1.8 million on 140 operating days for the year ended March 31, 2015.\nWe use a variety of financial and operational terms and concepts in the evaluation of our business and operations including the following:\nDepreciation and amortization for our fleet for the period April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013 was $4.0 million, which were comprised of depreciation of $3.9 million and amortization of deferred charges from drydock and special survey costs of approximately $0.1 million.\nVessel Operating Expenses\nPredecessor: Net cash used in financing activities amounted to $5.6 million for the period April 1, 2013 to July 28, 2013 and reflects the scheduled repayments due under our long-term debt.\nFleet Utilization. We calculate fleet utilization by dividing the number of operating days during a period by the number of available days during that period. An increase in non-scheduled off-hire days would reduce our operating days, and therefore, our fleet utilization. We use fleet utilization to measure our ability to efficiently find suitable employment for our vessels.\nDepreciation and amortization was approximately $42.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $28.5 million, or 202.2%, from $14.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to $23.8 million of depreciation and amortization related to sixteen of our ECO VLGCs that were delivered subsequent to March 31, 2015. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.7 million for the six VLGCs that were in our fleet during both years resulting from an increase in VLGC calendar days from 1,621 during the year ended March 31, 2015 to 2,196 during the year ended March 31, 2016.\nInterest and finance costs amounted to $12.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $12.5 million from $0.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2015. The increase of $12.5 million during this period was mainly due to a $13.8 million increase in interest incurred on our long-term debt, amortization and other financing expenses from $3.8 million in the year ended March 31, 2015 to $17.6 million in the year ended March 31, 2016. These increases were partially offset by a $1.3 million increase in capitalized interest from $3.5 million in the year ended March 31, 2015 to $4.8 million in the year ended March 31, 2016. The average indebtedness during the year ended March 31, 2016 was $543.1 million compared to $125.9 million during the year ended March 31, 2015, reflecting debt drawdowns of $676.8 million made under our 2015 Debt Facility. The outstanding balance of our long term debt as of March 31, 2016 was $836.4 million.", "item_7_tables": "Table 149: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td>

compared to $104.1 million in FY2015, primarily due to additional revenues from 16 new VLGC vessels delivered in FY2016. \n\n- Net income increased to $79.4 million in FY2016 from $1.3 million in FY2015. This was driven by higher revenues and lower voyage expenses, partially offset by higher vessel operating expenses, depreciation, interest costs, and general and administrative expenses.\n\n- The company took delivery of 16 new fuel-efficient ECO VLGC vessels during FY2016 that were financed through debt drawdowns of $676.8 million. As of March 31, 2016, the company had total debt outstanding of $836.4 million.\n\n- The company operates its vessels through a mix of multi-year time charters, short-term time charters, spot market voyages, and contract of affreightments (COAs). Eighteen of its twenty-two VLGCs participated in the Helios Pool joint venture that began operations in April 2015.\n\n- The company did not have any vessel impairment charges in FY2016. In FY2015, it recognized a $1.4 million impairment loss on one of its PGC vessels due to weak market conditions.\n\n- The company has strong liquidity with $46.4 million in cash and $50.8 million in restricted cash as of March 31, 2016. Its short and medium-term liquidity needs are expected to be met through operating cash flows and debt financing.\n\nIn summary, the company significantly grew its revenues and fleet in FY2016 while maintaining a strong financial position. The operating fleet expansion was financed primarily through debt offerings."}
