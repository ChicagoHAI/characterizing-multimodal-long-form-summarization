Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIntroduction\nThe Company is a holding company with investments in energy and energy services providers offering physical delivery and related services for both electricity and natural gas primarily in the south central U.S. The Company conducts these activities through two business segments: (i) electric utility and (ii) natural gas midstream operations. The accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. The Company generally uses the equity method of accounting for investments where its ownership interest is between 20 percent and 50 percent and it lacks the power to direct activities that most significantly impact economic performance.\nThe electric utility segment generates, transmits, distributes and sells electric energy in Oklahoma and western Arkansas. Its operations are conducted through OG&E and are subject to regulation by the OCC, the APSC and the FERC. OG&E was incorporated in 1902 under the laws of the Oklahoma Territory and is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. OG&E is the largest electric utility in Oklahoma, and its franchised service territory includes Fort Smith, Arkansas and the surrounding communities. OG&E sold its retail natural gas business in 1928 and is no longer engaged in the natural gas distribution business.\nThe natural gas midstream operations segment represents the Company's investment in Enable through wholly owned subsidiaries and ultimately OGE Holdings. Enable was formed in 2013, and its general partner is equally controlled by the Company and CenterPoint, who each have 50 percent management ownership. Based on the 50/50 management ownership, with neither company having control, the Company accounts for its interest in Enable using the equity method of accounting. Enable is primarily engaged in the business of gathering, processing, transporting and storing natural gas. Enable's natural gas gathering and processing assets are strategically located in four states and serve natural gas production from shale developments in the Anadarko, Arkoma and Ark-La-Tex Basins. Enable also owns a crude oil gathering business in the Anadarko and Williston Basins. Enable has intrastate natural gas transportation and storage assets that are located in Oklahoma as well as interstate assets that extend from western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle to Louisiana, from Louisiana to Illinois and from Louisiana to Alabama. At December 31, 2018, the Company owned 111.0 million common units, or 25.6 percent, of Enable's outstanding units. For additional information on the Company's equity investment in Enable and related party transactions, see Note 4 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nEnable's business is impacted by commodity prices which have declined and otherwise experienced significant volatility in recent years. Commodity prices impact the drilling and production of natural gas and crude oil in the areas served by Enable's systems, and the volumes on Enable's systems are negatively impacted if producers decrease drilling and production in those areas served. Both Enable's gathering and processing segment and Enable's transportation and storage segment can be impacted by drilling and production. Enable's gathering and processing segment primarily serve producers, and many producers utilize the services provided by Enable's transportation and storage segment. A decrease in volumes will decrease the cash flows from Enable's systems. A portion of our earnings and operating cash flows depend on the performance of, and distributions from, Enable. As disclosed in this Form 10-K, Enable is subject to a number of risks, including contract renewal risk, the reliance on the drilling and production decisions of others and the volatility of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil prices. If any of those risks were to occur, the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOn February 8, 2019, Enable announced a quarterly dividend distribution of $0.31800 per unit on its outstanding common units, which is unchanged from the previous quarter. If cash distributions to Enable's unitholders exceed $0.330625 per unit in any quarter, the general partner will receive increasing percentages, up to 50 percent, of the cash Enable distributes in excess of that amount. The Company is entitled to 60 percent of those \"incentive distributions.\"\nOG&E participates in the SPP Integrated Marketplace. As part of the Integrated Marketplace, the SPP has balancing authority responsibilities for its market participants. The SPP Integrated Marketplace functions as a centralized dispatch, where market participants, including OG&E, submit offers to sell power to the SPP from their resources and bid to purchase power from the SPP for their customers. The SPP Integrated Marketplace is intended to allow the SPP to optimize supply offers and demand bids based upon reliability and economic considerations and to determine which generating units will run at any given time for maximum cost-effectiveness within the SPP area. As a result, OG&E's generating units produce output that is different from OG&E's customer load requirements. Net fuel and purchased power costs are recovered through fuel adjustment clauses.\nOverview\nCompany Strategy\nThe Company's mission, through OG&E and the Company's equity interest in Enable, is to fulfill its critical role in the nation's electric utility and natural gas midstream pipeline infrastructure and meet individual customer's needs for energy and related services, focusing on safety, efficiency, reliability, customer service and risk management. The Company's corporate strategy is to continue to maintain its existing business mix and diversified asset position of its regulated electric utility business and interest in a publicly traded midstream company, while providing competitive energy products and services to customers, as well as seeking growth opportunities in both businesses.\nOG&E is focused on:\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>providing exceptional customer experiences by continuing to improve customer interfaces, tools, products and services that deliver high customer satisfaction and operating productivity;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>providing safe, reliable energy to the communities and customers we serve, with a particular focus on enhancing the value of the grid by improving distribution grid reliability by reducing the frequency and duration of customer interruptions and leveraging previous grid technology investments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>having strong regulatory and legislative relationships for the long-term benefit of our customers, investors and members;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>continuing to grow a zero-injury culture and deliver top-quartile safety results;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>ensuring we have the necessary mix of generation resources to meet the long-term needs of our customers; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>continuing focus on operational excellence and efficiencies in order to protect the customer bill.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdditionally, the Company wants to achieve a premium valuation of its businesses relative to its peers, grow earnings per share with a stable earnings pattern, create a high performance culture and achieve desired outcomes with target stakeholders. The Company's financial objectives include a long-term annual earnings growth rate for OG&E of four to six percent on a weather-normalized basis, maintaining a strong credit rating as well as targeting dividend increases of approximately 10 percent annually through 2019. The Company also utilizes cash distributions from its investment in Enable to help fund its capital needs and support future dividend growth. The Company believes it can accomplish these financial objectives by, among other things, pursuing multiple avenues to build its business, maintaining a diversified asset position, continuing to develop a wide range of skills to succeed with changes in its industries, providing products and services to customers efficiently, managing risks effectively and having strong regulatory and legislative relationships.\nSummary of Operating Results\n2018 compared to 2017. Net income was $425.5 million, or $2.12 per diluted share, in 2018 as compared to $619.0 million, or $3.10 per diluted share, in 2017. The decrease in net income of $193.5 million, or 31.3 percent, or $0.98 per diluted share, in 2018 as compared to 2017 is further discussed below.\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A decrease in net income at OGE Holdings of $216.4 million, or $1.08 per diluted share of the Company's common stock, was primarily due to lower income tax benefit due to an adjustment in 2017 resulting from the 2017 Tax Act, partially offset by higher equity in earnings of Enable due to increased revenues from Enable's gathering and processing business driven by higher processed volumes and higher natural gas gathering fees and gathered volumes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>An increase in net income at OG&E of $22.5 million, or $0.11 per diluted share of the Company's common stock, was primarily due to higher gross margin due to favorable weather (reduced by lower customer rates which were offset by lower income tax expense).

For Arkansas jurisdictional revenues, OG&E reserved the excess income taxes collected in current rates, plus carrying charges, from January 2018 through September 2018, as the Tax Adjustment Rider became effective on October 1, 2018. For FERC jurisdictional revenues, based on an order received from the FERC, OG&E reserved the excess income taxes collected in current rates from January 2018 through June 2018, as the new tax rate was reflected in billings beginning with the July 2018 invoice. Further, for Arkansas and FERC jurisdictional revenues, OG&E is also reserving any amortization of excess accumulated deferred income taxes associated with the 2017 Tax Act.\nIn January 2018, OG&E filed a general rate review in Oklahoma, seeking recovery of the seven combustion turbines that were part of the Mustang Modernization Plan, requesting an increase in depreciation rates to levels similar with rates in existence prior to the March 2017 OCC rate order and crediting customers for the impacts of the 2017 Tax Act. In June 2018, the OCC approved a Joint Stipulation and Settlement Agreement. As a result of the settlement, new rates were implemented on July 1, 2018.\nIn December 2018, OG&E filed a general rate review with the OCC, requesting a rate increase to recover its investments in the Dry Scrubbers project and in the conversion of Muskogee Units 4 and 5 to natural gas to comply with the Regional Haze Rule. The filing also seeks to align OG&E's return on equity more closely to the industry average and to align OG&E's depreciation rates to more realistically reflect its assets' lifespans.\nIn December 2018, OG&E filed an application for pre-approval from the OCC to acquire a coal- and natural gas-fired plant from AES and a natural gas-fired combined-cycle plant from Oklahoma Cogeneration LLC in 2019. The purchase of these assets is intended to replace capacity currently provided by power purchase contracts set to expire in 2019 and to help OG&E satisfy its customers' energy needs and load obligations to the SPP.\nFurther discussion can be found in Note 15 within \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\n2019 Outlook\nKey assumptions for 2019 include:\nOG&E\nThe Company projects OG&E to earn approximately $311 million to $325 million, or $1.55 to $1.62 per average diluted share, in 2019 and is based on the following assumptions:\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>normal weather patterns are experienced for the remainder of the year;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>gross margin on revenues of approximately $1.416 billion to $1.421 billion based on sales growth of approximately one percent on a weather-adjusted basis;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>operating expenses of approximately $941 million to $949 million, with operation and maintenance expenses comprising approximately 50 percent of the total;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>interest expense of approximately $143 million to $145 million which assumes a $1.4 million allowance for borrowed funds used during construction reduction to interest expense and assumes a debt issuance of $300 million in the second half of 2019;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>other income of approximately $3.5 million including approximately $3.3 million of allowance for equity funds used during construction;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an effective tax rate of approximately 4.4 percent;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>new rates take effect in Oklahoma by July 1, 2019; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>every 25 basis point change in the allowed Oklahoma return on equity equates to a change of approximately $9.4 million in revenue.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOG&E has significant seasonality in its earnings. OG&E typically shows the majority of its earnings in the second and third quarters due to the seasonal nature of air conditioning demand.\nOGE Holdings\nThe Company projects the earnings contribution from its ownership interest in Enable for 2019 to be approximately $104 million to $117 million, or $0.52 to $0.58 per average diluted share, and receive approximately $140 million in cash distributions.\nConsolidated OGE\nThe Company's 2019 earnings guidance is between approximately $412 million and $442 million of net income, or $2.05 to $2.20 per average diluted share, and is based on the following assumptions:\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>approximately 201 million average diluted shares outstanding;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an effective tax rate of approximately 9.9 percent; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $0.00 to ($0.02) or up to $4 million loss at OGE Energy due to interest expense.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOG&E's Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nGross margin is defined by OG&E as operating revenues less cost of sales. Cost of sales, as reflected on the income statement, includes fuel, purchased power and certain transmission expenses. Gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes depreciation and amortization and other operation and maintenance expenses. Expenses for fuel and purchased power are recovered through fuel adjustment clauses, and as a result, changes in these expenses are offset in operating revenues with no impact on net income. OG&E believes gross margin provides a more meaningful basis for evaluating its operations across periods than operating revenues because gross margin excludes the revenue effect of fluctuations in these expenses. Gross margin is used internally to measure performance against budget and in reports for management and the Board of Directors. OG&E's definition of gross margin may be different from similar terms used by other companies. Further, gross margin is not intended to replace operating revenues as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance. For a reconciliation of gross margin to revenue, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, see \"OG&E (Electric Utility) Results of Operations\" below.\nDetailed below is a reconciliation of gross margin to revenue included in the 2019 Outlook.\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2019\n(A)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales\n</td> <td>402\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(A)\n</td> <td>Based on the midpoint of OG&E earnings guidance for 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEnable's Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nGross margin is defined by Enable as total revenues minus costs of natural gas and NGLs, excluding depreciation and amortization. Total revenues consist of the fees that Enable charges its customers and the sales price of natural gas and NGLs that Enable sells. The cost of natural gas and NGLs consists of the purchase price of natural gas and NGLs that Enable purchases. Enable deducts the cost of natural gas and NGLs from total revenues to arrive at a measure of the core profitability of their mix of fee-based and commodity-based customer arrangements. Gross margin allows for meaningful comparison of the operating results between Enable's fee-based revenues and Enable's commodity-based contracts which involve the purchase or sale of natural gas, NGLs and/or crude oil. In addition, the Company believes gross margin allows for a meaningful comparison of the results of Enable's commodity-based activities across different commodity price environments because it measures the spread between the product sales price and cost of products sold. Enable's definition of gross margin may be different from similar terms used by other companies. Further, gross margin is not intended to replace operating revenues as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance. For a reconciliation of gross margin to revenue, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented with GAAP, for the years ending December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, see \"OGE Holdings (Natural Gas Midstream Operations) Results of Operations\" below.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis presents factors that affected the Company's consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 and the Company's consolidated financial position at December 31, 2018 and 2017.

These increases were partially offset by a decrease in system management activities, a\ndecrease in firm transportation services between Carthage, Texas and Perryville, Louisiana and a decrease in realized gains on natural gas derivatives.\nIncome tax benefit was $195.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to income tax expense of $40.5 million during the same period in 2016. The change is primarily due to a remeasurement of federal deferred taxes related to the 2017 Tax Act, a remeasurement of state deferred taxes and return to provision adjustments related to the Company's investment in Enable during the year ended December 31, 2016, offset by higher pre-tax operating income.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangement\nOG&E Railcar Lease Agreement\nAs of December 31, 2018, OG&E has a noncancellable operating lease with a purchase option, covering 1,093 rotary gondola railcars to transport coal from Wyoming to OG&E's coal-fired generation units. Rental payments are charged to fuel expense and are recovered through OG&E's tariffs and fuel adjustment clauses.\nAt the end of the lease term, which was February 1, 2019, OG&E had the option to either purchase the railcars at a stipulated fair market value or renew the lease. If OG&E chose not to purchase the railcars or renew the lease agreement and the actual fair value of the railcars was less than the stipulated fair market value, OG&E would have been responsible for the difference in those values up to a maximum of $16.2 million. OG&E was also required to maintain all of the railcars it had under the operating lease.\nOn February 1, 2019, OG&E renewed the lease agreement effective February 1, 2019, under similar terms and conditions, for a fleet of 780 railcars, expiring February 1, 2024. The number of railcars was reduced due to the conversion of Muskogee Units 4 and 5 to natural gas. At the end of the lease term, OG&E has the option to either purchase the railcars at a stipulated fair market value or renew the lease. If OG&E chooses not to purchase the railcars or renew the lease agreement and the actual fair value of the railcars is less than the stipulated fair market value, OG&E would be responsible for the difference in those values up to a maximum of $6.8 million.\nThe railcar lease was recorded on the Company's 2019 Balance Sheet upon adoption of the new leases standard (ASC 842).\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWorking Capital\nWorking capital is defined as the difference in current assets and current liabilities. The Company's working capital requirements are driven generally by changes in accounts receivable, accounts payable, commodity prices, credit extended to and the timing of collections from customers, the level and timing of spending for maintenance and expansion activity, inventory levels and fuel recoveries.\nCash and Cash Equivalents. The balance in Cash and Cash Equivalents was $94.3 million and $14.4 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $79.9 million, primarily due to normal business operations and quarterly distributions received from Enable, which the Company elected to apply towards payment of the $250.0 million senior notes due on January 15, 2019.\nAccounts Receivable and Accrued Unbilled Revenues. The balance of Accounts Receivable and Accrued Unbilled Revenues was $237.3 million and $257.1 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $19.8 million, or 7.7 percent, primarily due to a decrease in billings to OG&E's retail customers.\nFuel Inventories. The balance in Fuel Inventories was $57.6 million and $84.3 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $26.7 million, or 31.7 percent, primarily due to decreased coal and gas inventory.\nMaterials and Supplies, at Average Cost. The balance of Materials and Supplies, at Average Cost was $126.7 million and $80.8 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $45.9 million, or 56.8 percent, primarily due to increased inventory related to long-term service agreements.\nOther Current Assets. The balance of Other Current Assets was $29.5 million and $54.6 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $25.1 million, or 46.0 percent, primarily due to increased collections from customers associated with various rate riders.\nShort-Term Debt. There was no balance of Short-term Debt at December 31, 2018 compared to a balance of $168.4 million at December 31, 2017, respectively, a decrease of $168.4 million. The Company borrows on a short-term basis, as necessary, by the issuance of commercial paper and by borrowings under its revolving credit agreements. The decrease was primarily due to the proceeds of the senior notes issuance in August 2018 being utilized for general corporate purposes instead of borrowing under the Company's revolving credit agreement.\nAccounts Payable. The balance of Accounts Payable was $239.3 million and $230.4 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $8.9 million, or 3.9 percent, primarily due to the timing of vendor payments.\nAccrued Compensation. The balance of Accrued Compensation was $47.8 million and $35.9 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $11.9 million, or 33.1 percent, primarily due to higher accruals for incentive compensation, partially offset by a lower amount of accrued vacation.\nOther Current Liabilities. The balance of Other Current Liabilities was $87.0 million and $28.7 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $58.3 million, primarily due to amounts owed to customers, including the reserve for tax refund of $15.4 million resulting from the 2017 Tax Act, SPP reserves of $29.9 million and over recovery of the SPP cost tracker of $16.8 million.\nCash Flows\nTable 221: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31 (In millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>$\nChange\n</td> <td>%\nChange\n</td> <td>$\nChange\n</td> <td>%\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided from operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>951.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>784.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>644.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>166.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>139.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(576.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(821.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(620.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>245.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(201.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>32.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided from financing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(295.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(99.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(346.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Greater than a 100 percent variance.\nOperating Activities\nThe increase of $166.6 million, or 21.2 percent, in net cash provided from operating activities in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in vendor payments and an increase in amounts received from customers at OG&E.\nThe increase of $139.8 million, or 21.7 percent, in net cash provided from operating activities in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to increased amounts received from customers, primarily due to recovery of fuel costs, partially offset by an increase in vendor payments.\nInvesting Activities\nThe decrease of $245.9 million, or 29.9 percent, in net cash used in investing activities in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures primarily related to environmental and large capital projects at OG&E.\nThe increase of $201.5 million, or 32.5 percent, in net cash used in investing activities in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures related to multiple environmental and large capital projects at OG&E.\nFinancing Activities\nThe increase of $346.7 million in net cash used in financing activities in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to the issuance of less long-term debt by OG&E in 2018, a decrease in short-term debt and additional long-term debt paid off in 2018.\nThe increase of $150.7 million in net cash provided from financing activities in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to the issuance by OG&E of $300.0 million in long-term debt in each of March 2017 and August 2017, partially offset by a decrease in short-term debt and the payment of $100.0 million in long-term debt in November 2017.\n2018 Capital Requirements, Sources of Financing and Financing Activities\nTotal capital requirements, consisting of capital expenditures and maturities of long-term debt, were $823.7 million, and contractual obligations, net of recoveries through fuel adjustment clauses, were $76.4 million, resulting in total net capital requirements and contractual obligations of $900.1 million in 2018, of which $139.8 million was to comply with environmental regulations. This compares to net capital requirements of $1,049.2 million and net contractual obligations of $78.8 million totaling $1,128.0 million in 2017, of which $213.9 million was to comply with environmental regulations.\nIn 2018, the Company's primary sources of capital were cash generated from operations, proceeds from the issuance of long- and short-term debt and distributions from Enable. Changes in working capital reflect the seasonal nature of the Company's business, the revenue lag between billing and collection from customers and fuel inventories. See \"Working Capital\" for a discussion of significant changes in net working capital requirements as it pertains to operating cash flow and liquidity.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act\nDerivative instruments have been used at times in managing OG&E's commodity price exposure. The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, provides for regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission of certain commodity-related contracts. Although OG&E qualifies for an end-user exception from mandatory clearing of commodity-related swaps, these regulations could affect the ability of OG&E to participate in these markets and could add additional regulatory oversight over its contracting activities.\nFuture Capital Requirements\nThe Company's primary needs for capital are related to acquiring or constructing new facilities and replacing or expanding existing facilities at OG&E. Other working capital requirements are expected to be primarily related to maturing debt, operating lease obligations, fuel clause under and over recoveries and other general corporate purposes. The Company generally meets its cash needs through a combination of cash generated from operations, short-term borrowings (through a combination of bank borrowings and commercial paper) and permanent financings.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe Company's consolidated estimates of capital expenditures for the years 2019 through 2023 are shown in the following table. These capital expenditures represent the base maintenance capital expenditures (i.e., capital expenditures to maintain and operate the Company's businesses) plus capital expenditures for known and committed projects. Estimated capital expenditures for Enable are not included in the table below.\nTable 222: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>2023\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transmission\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Oklahoma\n</td> <td>195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>225\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Arkansas\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Generation\n</td> <td>145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total transmission, distribution, generation and other\n</td> <td>485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>395\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Projects:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental - Dry Scrubbers (A)\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental - natural gas conversion (A)\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Grid modernization, reliability, resiliency, technology and other\n</td> <td>115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>185\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total projects\n</td> <td>140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>185\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>580\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 223: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(A)\n</td> <td>Represent capital costs associated with OG&E's ECP to comply with the EPA's Regional Haze Rule.

The QF contract with AES expired on January 15, 2019, and the QF contract with Oklahoma Cogeneration LLC expires on August 31, 2019. On December 20, 2018, OG&E announced its plan to acquire power plants from AES and Oklahoma Cogeneration LLC, pending regulatory approval, to meet customers' energy needs. Further discussion can be found in Notes 14 and 15 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nThe actual cost of fuel used in electric generation (which includes the operating lease obligations for OG&E's railcar leases shown above) and certain purchased power costs are passed on to OG&E's customers through fuel adjustment clauses. Accordingly, while the cost of fuel related to operating leases and the vast majority of minimum fuel purchase commitments of OG&E noted above may increase capital requirements, such costs are recoverable through fuel adjustment clauses and have little, if any, impact on net capital requirements and future contractual obligations. The fuel adjustment clauses are subject to periodic review by the OCC and the APSC.\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nAt December 31, 2018, 32.4 percent of the Pension Plan investments were in listed common stocks with the balance primarily invested in corporate fixed income, other securities and U.S. Treasury notes and bonds as presented in Note 12 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" During 2018, actual losses on the Pension Plan were $39.2 million, compared to expected return on plan assets of $44.1 million. During the same time, corporate bond yields, which are used in determining the discount rate for future pension obligations, decreased. Funding levels are dependent on returns on plan assets and future discount rates. The Company made a $15.0 million and $20.0 million contribution to its Pension Plan in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company has not determined whether it will need to make any contributions to the Pension Plan in 2019. The Company could be required to make additional contributions if the value of its pension trust and postretirement benefit plan trust assets are adversely impacted by a major market disruption in the future.\nThe following table presents the status of the Company's Pension Plan, the Restoration of Retirement Income Plan and the postretirement benefit plans at December 31, 2018 and 2017. These amounts have been recorded in Accrued Benefit Obligations with the offset in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (except OG&E's portion, which is recorded as a regulatory asset as discussed in Note 1 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\") in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amounts in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss and those recorded as a regulatory asset represent a net periodic benefit cost to be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income in future periods.\nTable 228: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Pension Plan\n</td> <td>Restoration of Retirement\nIncome Plan\n</td> <td>Postretirement\nBenefit Plans\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31 (In millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefit obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>615.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>687.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>135.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>149.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value of plan assets\n</td> <td>522.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>635.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funded status at end of year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(93.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(52.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(90.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(99.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommon Stock Dividends\nThe Company's dividend policy is reviewed by the Board of Directors at least annually and is based on numerous factors, including management's estimation of the long-term earnings power of its businesses. At the Company's September 2018 board meeting, the Board of Directors approved management's recommendation of a 10 percent increase in the quarterly dividend rate to $0.3650 per share from $0.3325 per share effective in October 2018.\nFinancing Activities and Future Sources of Financing\nManagement expects that cash generated from operations, proceeds from the issuance of long- and short-term debt, proceeds from the sales of common stock to the public through the Company's Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan or other offerings and distributions from Enable will be adequate over the next three years to meet anticipated cash needs and to fund future growth opportunities. The Company utilizes short-term borrowings (through a combination of bank borrowings and commercial paper) to satisfy temporary working capital needs and as an interim source of financing capital expenditures until permanent financing is arranged.\nShort-Term Debt and Credit Facilities\nShort-term borrowings generally are used to meet working capital requirements. The Company borrows on a short-term basis, as necessary, by the issuance of commercial paper and by borrowings under its revolving credit agreement. The Company has revolving credit facilities totaling $900.0 million. These bank facilities can also be used as letter of credit facilities. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had no short-term debt outstanding compared to $168.4 million at December 31, 2017. The following tables highlight the Company's short-term debt activity as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nTable 229: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance of outstanding supporting letters of credit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted-average interest rate of outstanding supporting letters of credit\n</td> <td>1.05\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net available liquidity under revolving credit agreements\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>899.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance of cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average balance of short-term debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>128.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted-average interest rate of average balance of short-term debt\n</td> <td>2.10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maximum month-end balance of short-term debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>289.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn March 2017, the Company and OG&E entered into unsecured five-year revolving credit agreements totaling $900.0 million ($450.0 million for the Company and $450.0 million for OG&E). Each of the facilities contained an option, which could be exercised up to two times, to extend the term of the respective facility for an additional year. Effective March 9, 2018, the Company and OG&E utilized one of those extensions to extend the maturity of their respective credit facility from March 8, 2022 to March 8, 2023.\nOG&E has the necessary regulatory approvals to incur up to $800.0 million in short-term borrowings at any one time for a two-year period beginning January 1, 2019 and ending December 31, 2020. See Note 11 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for further discussion of the Company's short-term debt activity.\nIssuance of Long-Term Debt\nIn August 2018, OG&E issued $400.0 million of 3.80 percent senior notes due August 15, 2028. The proceeds from the issuance were added to OG&E's general funds to be used for general corporate purposes, including to fund the payment of OG&E's $250.0 million of 6.35 percent senior notes that matured on September 1, 2018, to repay short-term debt and to fund ongoing capital expenditures and working capital.\nSecurity Ratings\nTable 230: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Moody's Investors Service\n</td> <td>S&P's Global Ratings\n</td> <td>Fitch Ratings\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OG&E Senior Notes\n</td> <td>A2\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> <td>A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OGE Energy Senior Notes\n</td> <td>Baa1\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OGE Energy Commercial Paper\n</td> <td>P2\n</td> <td>A2\n</td> <td>F2\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccess to reasonably priced capital is dependent in part on credit and security ratings. Generally, lower ratings lead to higher financing costs. Pricing grids associated with the Company's credit facilities could cause annual fees and borrowing rates to increase if an adverse rating impact occurs. The impact of any future downgrade could include an increase in the costs of the Company's short-term borrowings, but a reduction in the Company's credit ratings would not result in any defaults or accelerations. Any future downgrade could also lead to higher long-term borrowing costs and, if below investment grade, would require the Company to post collateral or letters of credit.\nA security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Such rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the credit rating agency, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nOn March 5, 2018, S&P's Global Ratings revised the rating outlooks on the Company and OG&E from stable to negative. S&P's Global Ratings indicated that the revised outlooks reflect the limited cushion in company financial measures, which\nincorporate higher capital spending plans and the effects of the 2017 Tax Act, and uncertainty regarding regulatory risk. The revised outlooks did not trigger any collateral requirements or change fees under the revolving credit agreements.\nOn June 18, 2018, S&P's Global Ratings lowered its issuer credit ratings for the Company and OG&E from A- to BBB+ and revised their rating outlooks from negative to stable. S&P's Global Ratings also lowered its rating on OG&E's senior unsecured notes from A- to BBB+. S&P's Global Ratings indicated that the changes in ratings are a result of the $64.0 million rate decrease in the June 19, 2018 OCC settlement, the existing level of depreciation expense and continued capital spending, which places the Company and OG&E at a higher level of financial risk in S&P's Global Ratings' risk profile. Furthermore, S&P's Global Ratings indicated that the Company's change in credit rating was impacted by Enable's business risk, due to the volatility of the oil and gas industry. However, S&P's Global Ratings indicated that the stable outlook reflects its expectation that the Company and OG&E will be able to manage future regulatory risk in Oklahoma.\nOn July 11, 2018, Moody's Investors Service lowered its rating from A3 to Baa1 for the Company and from A1 to A2 for OG&E with both companies having negative outlooks. The Oklahoma regulatory environment and the 2017 Tax Act were both cited by Moody's Investors Service as contributing factors to the credit downgrade. Moody's Investors Service indicated that the negative outlook for OG&E is a reflection of current capital expenditures relating to environmental projects, upcoming debt maturities over the next year and decreased cash flow as a result of the 2017 Tax Act. In addition to the OG&E impacts, Moody's Investors Service indicated that the negative outlook for the Company is a reflection of Enable's business risk, due to the volatility of the oil and gas industry, which Moody's Investors Service indicated could lead to decreased distributions.\nOn August 1, 2018, Fitch Ratings lowered its senior unsecured debt rating from A- to BBB+ for the Company and from A+ to A for OG&E with both companies having stable outlooks. Fitch Ratings cited the regulatory environment in Oklahoma, underscored by the unfavorable rate review outcomes in 2017 and 2018 and uncertainty surrounding regulatory treatment for OG&E's investment in the Dry Scrubbers at Sooner Units 1 and 2, as a key contributing factor to the credit downgrade. Fitch Ratings also indicated that the Company's credit profile reflects Enable's higher operating risks.\nThe Company's and OG&E's borrowing costs under the credit agreements will increase immaterially as a result of these recent credit downgrades.\nFuture financing requirements may be dependent, to varying degrees, upon numerous factors such as general economic conditions, abnormal weather, load growth, commodity prices, acquisitions of other businesses and/or development of projects, actions by rating agencies, inflation, changes in environmental laws or regulations, rate increases or decreases allowed by regulatory agencies, new legislation and market entry of competing electric power generators.\nCommon Stock\nThe Company does not expect to issue any common stock in 2019 from its Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. See Note 9 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for a discussion of the Company's common stock activity.\nDistributions by Enable\nPursuant to the Enable Limited Partnership Agreement, Enable made distributions of $141.2 million, $141.2 million and $141.2 million to the Company during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As required by Enable's Limited Partnership Agreement and General Partner Agreement, respectively, the last permitted distribution date is 60 days after the close of each quarter, and the distribution deadline is five days following distributions by Enable.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contain information that is pertinent to Management's Discussion and Analysis. In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Changes to these assumptions and estimates could have a material effect on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. However, the Company believes it has taken reasonable positions where assumptions and estimates are used in order to minimize the negative financial impact to the Company that could result if actual results vary from the assumptions and estimates. In management's opinion, the areas of the Company where the most significant judgment is exercised includes the determination of Pension Plan assumptions, income taxes, contingency reserves, asset retirement obligations and depreciable lives of property, plant and equipment. For the electric utility segment, significant judgment is also exercised in the determination of\nregulatory assets and liabilities and unbilled revenues. The selection, application and disclosure of the following critical accounting estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. The Company discusses its significant accounting policies, including those that do not require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates, in Note 1 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nThe Company has a Pension Plan that covers a significant amount of the Company's employees hired before December 1, 2009. Effective December 1, 2009, the Company's Pension Plan is no longer being offered to employees hired on or after December 1, 2009. The Company also has defined benefit postretirement plans that cover a significant amount of its employees. Pension and other postretirement plan expenses and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by the market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, assumed discount rates and the level of funding. Actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized. The Pension Plan rate assumptions are shown in Note 12 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" The assumed return on plan assets is based on management's expectation of the long-term return on the plan assets portfolio. The discount rate used to compute the present value of plan liabilities is based generally on rates of high-grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which benefits will be paid. Funding levels are dependent on returns on plan assets and future discount rates. Higher returns on plan assets and an increase in discount rates will reduce funding requirements to the Pension Plan.\nThe following table indicates the sensitivity of the Pension Plan funded status to these variables.\nTable 231: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>Impact on Funded Status\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Actual plan asset returns\n</td> <td>+/- 1 percent\n</td> <td>+/- $5.2 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>+/- 0.25 percent\n</td> <td>+/- $11.4 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contributions\n</td> <td>+/- $10 million\n</td> <td>+/- $10.0 million\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, a deferred tax asset or liability is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities as well as tax credit carry forwards and net operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of the change.\nThe application of income tax law is complex. Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and often ambiguous. Interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time. Accordingly, it is necessary to make judgments regarding income tax exposure. As a result, changes in these judgments can materially affect amounts the Company recognized in its consolidated financial statements. Tax positions taken by the Company on its income tax returns that are recognized in the financial statements must satisfy a more likely than not recognition threshold, assuming that the position will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information. See Note 8 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for discussion of the effects of the 2017 Tax Act and other tax policies.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nThe Company has recorded asset retirement obligations that are being accreted over their respective lives ranging from two to 74 years. The inputs used in the valuation of asset retirement obligations include the assumed life of the asset placed into service, the average inflation rate, market risk premium, the credit-adjusted risk free interest rate and the timing of incurring costs related to the retirement of the asset.\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nOG&E, as a regulated utility, is subject to accounting principles for certain types of rate-regulated activities, which provide that certain incurred costs that would otherwise be charged to expense can be deferred as regulatory assets, based on the expected recovery from customers in future rates. Likewise, certain actual or anticipated credits that would otherwise reduce expense can be deferred as regulatory liabilities, based on the expected flowback to customers in future rates. Management's expected recovery\nof deferred costs and flowback of deferred credits generally results from specific decisions by regulators granting such ratemaking treatment.\nOG&E records certain incurred costs and obligations as regulatory assets or liabilities if, based on regulatory orders or other available evidence, it is probable that the costs or obligations will be included in amounts allowable for recovery or refund in future rates. The benefit obligations regulatory asset is comprised of expenses recorded which are probable of future recovery and that have not yet been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost, including net loss and prior service cost.\nUnbilled Revenues\nOG&E recognizes revenue from electric sales when power is delivered to customers. OG&E reads its customers' meters and sends bills to its customers throughout each month. As a result, there is a significant amount of customers' electricity consumption that has not been billed at the end of each month. OG&E accrues an estimate of the revenues for electric sales delivered since the latest billings. Unbilled revenue is presented in Accrued Unbilled Revenues on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and in Operating Revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income based on estimates of usage and prices during the period. At December 31, 2018, if the estimated usage or price used in the unbilled revenue calculation were to increase or decrease by one percent, this would cause a change in the unbilled revenues recognized of $0.4 million. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, Accrued Unbilled Revenues were $62.6 million and $66.5 million, respectively. The estimates that management uses in this calculation could vary from the actual amounts to be paid by customers.\nAllowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable\nCustomer balances are generally written off if not collected within six months after the final billing date. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for OG&E is calculated by multiplying the last six months of electric revenue by the provision rate, which is based on a 12-month historical average of actual balances written off. To the extent the historical collection rates are not representative of future collections, there could be an effect on the amount of uncollectible expense recognized. Also, a portion of the uncollectible provision related to fuel within the Oklahoma jurisdiction is being recovered through the fuel adjustment clause. At December 31, 2018, if the provision rate were to increase or decrease by 10 percent, this would cause a change in the uncollectible expense recognized of $0.2 million. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is a reduction to Accounts Receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is included in the Other Operation and Maintenance Expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $1.7 million and $1.5 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nAccounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for discussion of current accounting pronouncements that are applicable to the Company.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is confronted with issues or events that may result in a contingent liability. These generally relate to lawsuits or claims made by third parties, including governmental agencies. When appropriate, management consults with legal counsel and other experts to assess the claim. If, in management's opinion, the Company has incurred a probable loss as set forth by GAAP, an estimate is made of the loss, and the appropriate accounting entries are reflected in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. At the present time, based on available information, the Company believes that any reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued amounts arising out of pending or threatened lawsuits or claims would not be quantitatively material to its financial statements and would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Notes 14 and 15 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings\" for a discussion of the Company's commitments and contingencies.\nEnvironmental Laws and Regulations\nThe activities of the Company are subject to numerous stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection. These laws and regulations can change, restrict or otherwise impact the Company's business activities in many ways, including the handling or disposal of waste material, planning for future construction activities to avoid or mitigate harm to threatened or endangered species and requiring the installation and operation of emissions control equipment. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Management believes that all of its operations are in substantial compliance with current federal, state and local environmental standards.\nEnvironmental regulation can increase the cost of planning, design, initial installation and operation of OG&E's facilities. Management continues to evaluate its compliance with existing and proposed environmental legislation and regulations and implement appropriate environmental programs in a competitive market.\nIt is estimated that OG&E's total expenditures to comply with environmental laws, regulations and requirements for 2019 will be $50.0 million, of which $25.5 million is for capital expenditures. The amounts for OG&E include capital expenditures for the Dry Scrubbers at Sooner Units 1 and 2 and the conversion of Muskogee Units 4 and 5 to natural gas. It is estimated that OG&E's total expenditures to comply with environmental laws, regulations and requirements for 2020 will be $22.6 million, of which $0.2 million is for capital expenditures.\nAir\nFederal Clean Air Act Overview\nOG&E's operations are subject to the Federal Clean Air Act, as amended, and comparable state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including electric generating units, and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. Such laws and regulations may require that OG&E obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions or result in the increase of existing air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations or install emission control equipment. OG&E likely will be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment and technology in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions.\nRegional Haze Control Measures\nThe EPA's 2005 Regional Haze Rule is intended to protect visibility in certain national parks and wilderness areas throughout the U.S. that may be impacted by air pollutant emissions. On December 28, 2011, the EPA issued a final Regional Haze Rule for Oklahoma which adopted a FIP for SO2 emissions at Sooner Units 1 and 2 and Muskogee Units 4 and 5. The FIP compliance date was January 4, 2019 as a result of an appeal filed by OG&E and others.\nTo satisfy the FIP, OG&E installed Dry Scrubbers at Sooner Units 1 and 2 and is converting Muskogee Units 4 and 5 to natural gas. As of December 31, 2018, OG&E has invested $504.3 million in the Dry Scrubbers and $50.5 million in the Muskogee natural gas conversion.\nCross-State Air Pollution Rule\nIn August 2011, the EPA finalized its CSAPR that required 27 states in the eastern half of the U.S. (including Oklahoma) to reduce power plant emissions that contribute to ozone and particulate matter pollution in other states. Litigation challenging the rule delayed the effective date until 2014. Several parties to that litigation, including OG&E, have petitions for review that remain pending although the rule is now effective. Compliance with the CSAPR began in 2015 using the amount of allowances originally scheduled to be available in 2012. OG&E has installed seven low NOX burner systems on two Muskogee units, two Sooner units and three Seminole units and is in compliance.\nOn September 7, 2016, the EPA finalized an update to the 2011 CSAPR. The new rule applies to ozone-season NOX in 22 eastern states (including Oklahoma), utilizes a cap and trade program for NOX emissions and went into effect on May 1, 2017. The rule reduces the 2016 CSAPR emissions cap for all seven of OG&E's coal and gas facilities by 47 percent combined. OG&E and numerous other parties filed petitions for judicial and administrative review of the 2016 rule. Oral argument before the D.C. Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals was held on October 3, 2018.\nDue to the pending litigation and administrative proceedings, the ultimate timing and impact of the 2016 CSAPR update rule on our operations cannot be determined with certainty at this time. However, the Company does not anticipate additional capital expenditures beyond what has already been disclosed and does not expect that the reduced emissions cap, if upheld, will have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nHazardous Air Pollutants Emission Standards\nOn February 16, 2012, the EPA published the final MATS rule regulating the emissions of certain hazardous air pollutants from electric generating units, which became effective April 16, 2012. The Company complied with the MATS rule by the April\n16, 2016 deadline that applied to OG&E by installing activated carbon injection for all five coal units. Nonetheless, there is continuing litigation, to which the Company is not a party, challenging whether the EPA had statutory authority to issue the MATS rule. On December 27, 2018, the EPA released a proposed rule reconsidering certain elements of the 2012 rule in response to lengthy litigation in the D.C. Circuit Court. The proposed rule will be available for public comment when it is published in the Federal Register. The Company cannot predict the outcome of this litigation or regulatory proposal or how it will affect the Company.\nNational Ambient Air Quality Standards\nThe EPA is required to set NAAQS for certain pollutants considered to be harmful to public health or the environment. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to review each NAAQS every five years. As a result of these reviews, the EPA periodically has taken action to adopt more stringent NAAQS for those pollutants. If any areas of Oklahoma were to be designated as not attaining the NAAQS for a particular pollutant, the Company could be required to install additional emission controls on its facilities to help the state achieve attainment with the NAAQS. As of December 31, 2018, no areas of Oklahoma had been designated as non-attainment for pollutants that are likely to affect the Company's operations. Several processes are under way to designate areas in Oklahoma as attaining or not attaining revised NAAQS.\nThe EPA proposed to designate part of Muskogee County, in which OG&E's Muskogee Power Plant is located, as non-attainment for the 2010 SO2 NAAQS on March 1, 2016, even though nearby monitors indicate compliance with the NAAQS. The proposed designation is based on modeling that does not reflect the planned conversion of two of the coal units at Muskogee to natural gas. OG&E commented that the EPA should defer a designation of the area to allow time for additional monitoring. The State of Oklahoma's revised monitoring plan was approved by the EPA, and the required monitoring commenced at the beginning of 2017 and will continue through the end of 2019. Nonetheless, the EPA has a deadline for making a decision on the designation pursuant to a consent decree entered by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California to resolve a citizen suit. The deadline has been extended several times, with the current deadline being August 26, 2017, but a decision has yet to be reached. It is unclear what impact, if any, the consent decree deadline will have on the monitoring plan. At this time, OG&E cannot determine with any certainty whether the proposed designation of Muskogee County will cause a material impact to OG&E's financial results. The EPA has published final decisions on all other areas of Oklahoma. In this decision, Noble County, in which the Sooner plant is located, was deemed to be in attainment with the 2010 standard.\nOn September 30, 2015, the EPA finalized a NAAQS for ozone at 70 ppb, which is more stringent than the previous standard of 75 ppb set in 2008. In September 2016, Oklahoma submitted to the EPA the recommendation of \"attainment/unclassifiable\" for all 77 counties in Oklahoma. On June 4, 2018, the EPA published its final determination that there are no nonattainment areas in Oklahoma. Based on this assessment, no material impacts are anticipated at this time.\nThe Company continues to monitor these processes and their possible impact on its operations but, at this time, cannot determine with any certainty whether they will cause a material impact to the Company's financial results.\nClimate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emissions\nThere is continuing discussion and evaluation of possible global climate change in certain regulatory and legislative arenas. The focus is generally on emissions of greenhouse gases, including CO2, sulfur hexafluoride and methane, and whether these emissions are contributing to the warming of the earth's atmosphere. On June 1, 2017, President Trump announced that the U.S. will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord and begin negotiations to re-enter the agreement with different terms. A new agreement may result in future additional emissions reductions in the U.S.; however, it is not possible to determine what the international legal standards for greenhouse gas emissions will be in the future and the extent to which these commitments will be implemented through the Clean Air Act or any other existing statutes and new legislation.\nIf legislation or regulations are passed at the federal or state levels in the future requiring mandatory reductions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases on the Company's facilities, this could result in significant additional compliance costs that would affect the Company's future consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates. Several states outside the area where the Company operates have passed laws, adopted regulations or undertaken regulatory initiatives to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs.\nOn October 23, 2015, the EPA published the final Clean Power Plan that established standards of performance for CO2 emissions from existing fossil-fuel-fired power plants along with state-specific CO2 reduction standards expressed as both rate-based (lbs./MWh) and mass-based (tons/yr.) goals. However, the rule was challenged in court when it was issued, and the U.S. Supreme Court issued orders staying implementation of the Clean Power Plan on February 9, 2016 pending resolution of the court\nchallenges. The EPA published a proposal on October 16, 2017 to repeal the Clean Power Plan. On August 31, 2018, without acting on the proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan, the EPA published the Affordable Clean Energy Rule, a proposed rule to replace the Clean Power Plan. The ultimate timing and impact of these standards on OG&E's operations cannot be determined with certainty at this time, although a requirement for significant reduction of CO2 emissions from existing fossil-fuel-fired power plants ultimately could result in significant additional compliance costs that would affect the Company's future consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.\nNonetheless, OG&E's current business strategy will result in a reduced carbon emissions rate compared to current levels. As discussed in Note 15 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" under \"Pending Regulatory Matters,\" OG&E's plan to comply with the EPA's MATS rule and Regional Haze Rule FIP includes converting two coal-fired generating units at the Muskogee Station to natural gas, among other measures. OG&E's deployment of Smart Grid technology helps to reduce the peak load demand. OG&E is also deploying more renewable energy sources that do not emit greenhouse gases. OG&E's service territory borders one of the nation's best wind resource areas, and OG&E has leveraged its geographic position to develop renewable energy resources and completed transmission investments to deliver the renewable energy. The SPP has begun to authorize the construction of transmission lines capable of bringing renewable energy out of the wind resource areas in western Oklahoma, the Texas Panhandle and western Kansas to load centers by planning for more transmission to be built in the area. In addition to increasing overall system reliability, these new transmission resources should provide greater access to additional wind resources that are currently constrained due to existing transmission delivery limitations.\nEPA Startup, Shutdown and Malfunction Policy\nOn May 22, 2015, the EPA issued a final rule to address the provisions in the SIPs of 36 states (including Oklahoma) regarding the treatment of emissions that occur during startup, shutdown and malfunction operations. The final rule clarifies the EPA's Startup, Shutdown and Malfunction Policy. Although judicial challenges to the rule are ongoing, the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality submitted a SIP revision for the EPA's approval on November 7, 2016 to comply with this rule. This rule has resulted in permit modifications for certain OG&E units. The Company does not anticipate capital expenditures or a material impact to its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, as a result of adoption of this rule.\nAir Quality Control System\nThe Dry Scrubber system on Sooner Unit 1 completed certain emission testing in October 2018 and was placed into service. The Dry Scrubber system on Sooner Unit 2 completed certain emission testing in January 2019 and was placed into service. More detail regarding the ECP can be found under \"Pending Regulatory Matters\" in Note 15 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nEndangered Species\nCertain federal laws, including the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Endangered Species Act, provide special protection to certain designated species. These laws and any state equivalents provide for significant civil and criminal penalties for unpermitted activities that result in harm to or harassment of certain protected animals and plants, including damage to their habitats. If such species are located in an area in which the Company conducts operations, or if additional species in those areas become subject to protection, the Company's operations and development projects, particularly transmission, wind or pipeline projects, could be restricted or delayed, or the Company could be required to implement expensive mitigation measures.\nWaste\nOG&E's operations generate wastes that are subject to the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 as well as comparable state laws which impose detailed requirements for the handling, storage, treatment and disposal of waste.\nIn 2015, the EPA finalized a rule under the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act for the handling and disposal of coal combustion residuals or coal ash. The rule regulates coal ash as a solid waste rather than a hazardous waste, which would have made the management of coal ash more costly. Recent litigation decisions at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals indicate that the EPA will be required to revise certain aspects of this rule. OG&E manages one regulated inactive coal ash impoundment that is expected to be clean-closed in 2019. On June 28, 2018, the EPA approved the State of Oklahoma's application for a state coal ash permitting program that will operate in lieu of the federal coal ash program promulgated under the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The EPA approval of the State of Oklahoma permitting program is currently under litigation. The Company is monitoring regulatory developments relating to this rule, none of which appear to be material to OG&E at this time. OG&E is in compliance with this rule at this time.\nThe Company has sought and will continue to seek pollution prevention opportunities and to evaluate the effectiveness of its waste reduction, reuse and recycling efforts. In 2018, the Company obtained refunds of $1.9 million from the recycling of scrap metal, salvaged transformers and used transformer oil. This figure does not include the additional savings gained through the reduction and/or avoidance of disposal costs and the reduction in material purchases due to the reuse of existing materials. Similar savings are anticipated in future years.\nWater\nOG&E's operations are subject to the Federal Clean Water Act and comparable state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations impose detailed requirements and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state and federal waters.\nThe EPA issued a final rule on May 19, 2014 to implement Section 316(b) of the Federal Clean Water Act, which requires that power plant cooling water intake structure location, design, construction and capacity reflect the best available technology for minimizing their adverse environmental impact via the impingement and entrainment of aquatic organisms. The Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality issued final permits on December 22, 2017 and August 22, 2018 for Muskogee Power Plant and Seminole Power Plant, respectively, in compliance with the final 316(b) rule, and OG&E did not incur any material costs associated with the rule's implementation at either location. OG&E expects to be able to provide a reasonable estimate of any material costs associated with the rule's implementation at other facilities following the future issuance of permits from the State of Oklahoma.\nIn 2015, the EPA issued a final rule addressing the effluent limitation guidelines for power plants under the Federal Clean Water Act. The final rule establishes technology and performance based standards that may apply to discharges of six waste streams including bottom ash transport water. Compliance with this rule will occur by 2023; however, on April 12, 2017, the EPA granted a Petition for Reconsideration of the 2015 Rule. OG&E is evaluating what, if any, compliance actions are needed but is not able to quantify with any certainty what costs may be incurred. OG&E expects to be able to provide a reasonable estimate of any material costs associated with the rule's implementation following issuance of the permits from the State of Oklahoma.\nSite Remediation\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment. Because OG&E utilizes various products and generates wastes that are considered hazardous substances for purposes of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, OG&E could be subject to liability for the costs of cleaning up and restoring sites where those substances have been released to the environment. At this time, it is not anticipated that any associated liability will cause a significant impact to OG&E.\nFor a further discussion regarding contingencies relating to environmental laws and regulations, see Note 14 in \"Item 8.

S&P's Global Ratings also lowered its rating on OG&E's senior unsecured notes from A- to BBB+. S&P's Global Ratings indicated that the changes in ratings are a result of the $64.0 million rate decrease in the June 19, 2018 OCC settlement, the existing level of depreciation expense and continued capital spending, which places the Company and OG&E at a higher level of financial risk in S&P's Global Ratings' risk profile. Furthermore, S&P's Global Ratings indicated that the Company's change in credit rating was impacted by Enable's business risk, due to the volatility of the oil and gas industry. However, S&P's Global Ratings indicated that the stable outlook reflects its expectation that the Company and OG&E will be able to manage future regulatory risk in Oklahoma.\nOther Current Liabilities.

The rule regulates coal ash as a solid waste rather than a hazardous waste, which would have made the management of coal ash more costly. Recent litigation decisions at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals indicate that the EPA will be required to revise certain aspects of this rule. OG&E manages one regulated inactive coal ash impoundment that is expected to be clean-closed in 2019. On June 28, 2018, the EPA approved the State of Oklahoma's application for a state coal ash permitting program that will operate in lieu of the federal coal ash program promulgated under the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The EPA approval of the State of Oklahoma permitting program is currently under litigation. The Company is monitoring regulatory developments relating to this rule, none of which appear to be material to OG&E at this time. OG&E is in compliance with this rule at this time.\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

will result in a reduced carbon emissions rate compared to current levels. As discussed in Note 15 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" under \"Pending Regulatory Matters,\" OG&E's plan to comply with the EPA's MATS rule and Regional Haze Rule FIP includes converting two coal-fired generating units at the Muskogee Station to natural gas, among other measures. OG&E's deployment of Smart Grid technology helps to reduce the peak load demand. OG&E is also deploying more renewable energy sources that do not emit greenhouse gases. OG&E's service territory borders one of the nation's best wind resource areas, and OG&E has leveraged its geographic position to develop renewable energy resources and completed transmission investments to deliver the renewable energy. The SPP has begun to authorize the construction of transmission lines capable of bringing renewable energy out of the wind resource areas in western Oklahoma, the Texas Panhandle and western Kansas to load centers by planning for more transmission to be built in the area. In addition to increasing overall system reliability, these new transmission resources should provide greater access to additional wind resources that are currently constrained due to existing transmission delivery limitations.\nThe increase in the Company's equity in earnings of Enable was primarily due to the following: \nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>Income Statement Change at Enable\n</td> <td>Impact to Company's Equity in Earnings\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>167.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preferred distributions\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas gathered volumes - TBtu/d\n</td> <td>4.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transported volumes - TBtu/d\n</td> <td>5.56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas processed volumes - TBtu/d\n</td> <td>2.40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.96\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NGL sold - MBbl/d (A)(B)\n</td> <td>132.06\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crude oil and condensate gathered volumes - MBbl/d\n</td> <td>41.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase of $201.5 million, or 32.5 percent, in net cash used in investing activities in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures related to multiple environmental and large capital projects at OG&E.\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>Income Statement Change at Enable\n</td> <td>Impact to Company's Equity in Earnings\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operation and maintenance, General and administrative\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 new rates take effect in Oklahoma by July 1, 2019; and \nOG&E\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>Income Statement Change at Enable\n</td> <td>Impact to Company's Equity in Earnings\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>160.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operation and maintenance, General and administrative\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 compared to 2016.

The proposed designation is based on modeling that does not reflect the planned conversion of two of the coal units at Muskogee to natural gas. OG&E commented that the EPA should defer a designation of the area to allow time for additional monitoring. The State of Oklahoma's revised monitoring plan was approved by the EPA, and the required monitoring commenced at the beginning of 2017 and will continue through the end of 2019. Nonetheless, the EPA has a deadline for making a decision on the designation pursuant to a consent decree entered by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California to resolve a citizen suit. The deadline has been extended several times, with the current deadline being August 26, 2017, but a decision has yet to be reached. It is unclear what impact, if any, the consent decree deadline will have on the monitoring plan. At this time, OG&E cannot determine with any certainty whether the proposed designation of Muskogee County will cause a material impact to OG&E's financial results.

The proposed rule will be available for public comment when it is published in the Federal Register.

In June 2018, the OCC approved a Joint Stipulation and Settlement Agreement. As a result of the settlement, new rates were implemented on July 1, 2018.\n\nThe Company has a Pension Plan that covers a significant amount of the Company's employees hired before December 1, 2009. Effective December 1, 2009, the Company's Pension Plan is no longer being offered to employees hired on or after December 1, 2009. The Company also has defined benefit postretirement plans that cover a significant amount of its employees. Pension and other postretirement plan expenses and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by the market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, assumed discount rates and the level of funding. Actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized. The Pension Plan rate assumptions are shown in Note 12 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" The assumed return on plan assets is based on management's expectation of the long-term return on the plan assets portfolio. The discount rate used to compute the present value of plan liabilities is based generally on rates of high-grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which benefits will be paid. Funding levels are dependent on returns on plan assets and future discount rates. Higher returns on plan assets and an increase in discount rates will reduce funding requirements to the Pension Plan.\n (A) Maturities of the Company's long-term debt during the next five years consist of $250.1 million, $0.1 million, $0.1 million, $0.1 million and $0.1 million in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. \nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $40.7 million, or 14.5 percent, primarily due to a reduction in depreciation expense of approximately $20.0 million recorded in March 2017 for the period from July 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016 resulting from the March 2017 OCC rate order, and additional assets being placed into service.\n \u2022 other income of approximately $3.5 million including approximately $3.3 million of allowance for equity funds used during construction; \nThe following operating results analysis by business segment includes intercompany transactions that are eliminated in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n (A) Cooling and heating degree days increased nine percent and 31 percent, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the same periods in 2017. \n\nEnable's transportation and storage business segment reported an increase in operating income of $13.0 million. The following table presents summarized information regarding Enable's transportation and storage business segment income statement changes for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, and the corresponding impact those changes had on the Company's equity in earnings of Enable.\nThe Company's and OG&E's borrowing costs under the credit agreements will increase immaterially as a result of these recent credit downgrades.\n \u2022 an increase in crude oil, condensate and produced water gathering revenues driven by an increase in the Anadarko Basin due to the acquisition of Velocity Holdings, LLC in the fourth quarter of 2018 and an increase in the Williston Basin due to higher gathered volumes, partially offset by a reduction in average rates; partially offset by \nThe electric utility segment generates, transmits, distributes and sells electric energy in Oklahoma and western Arkansas. Its operations are conducted through OG&E and are subject to regulation by the OCC, the APSC and the FERC. OG&E was incorporated in 1902 under the laws of the Oklahoma Territory and is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. OG&E is the largest electric utility in Oklahoma, and its franchised service territory includes Fort Smith, Arkansas and the surrounding communities. OG&E sold its retail natural gas business in 1928 and is no longer engaged in the natural gas distribution business.\nEnable's transportation and storage business segment reported a decrease in operating income of $19.0 million. The following table presents summarized information regarding Enable's transportation and storage business segment income statement changes for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, and the corresponding impact those changes had on the Company's equity in earnings of Enable.\n(B) NGLs sold includes volumes of NGLs withdrawn from inventory or purchased for system balancing purposes.\n2018 compared to 2017. Net income was $425.5 million, or $2.12 per diluted share, in 2018 as compared to $619.0 million, or $3.10 per diluted share, in 2017. The decrease in net income of $193.5 million, or 31.3 percent, or $0.98 per diluted share, in 2018 as compared to 2017 is further discussed below.\nThe increase of $139.8 million, or 21.7 percent, in net cash provided from operating activities in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to increased amounts received from customers, primarily due to recovery of fuel costs, partially offset by an increase in vendor payments.\nMaterials and Supplies, at Average Cost. The balance of Materials and Supplies, at Average Cost was $126.7 million and $80.8 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $45.9 million, or 56.8 percent, primarily due to increased inventory related to long-term service agreements.\nThe Company's 2019 earnings guidance is between approximately $412 million and $442 million of net income, or $2.05 to $2.20 per average diluted share, and is based on the following assumptions:\nResults by Business Segment\n \u2022 continuing to grow a zero-injury culture and deliver top-quartile safety results; \nIssuance of Long-Term Debt\nOn February 1, 2019, OG&E renewed the lease agreement effective February 1, 2019, under similar terms and conditions, for a fleet of 780 railcars, expiring February 1, 2024. The number of railcars was reduced due to the conversion of Muskogee Units 4 and 5 to natural gas. At the end of the lease term, OG&E has the option to either purchase the railcars at a stipulated fair market value or renew the lease. If OG&E chooses not to purchase the railcars or renew the lease agreement and the actual fair value of the railcars is less than the stipulated fair market value, OG&E would be responsible for the difference in those values up to a maximum of $6.8 million.\nThe following table presents the status of the Company's Pension Plan, the Restoration of Retirement Income Plan and the postretirement benefit plans at December 31, 2018 and 2017. These amounts have been recorded in Accrued Benefit Obligations with the offset in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (except OG&E's portion, which is recorded as a regulatory asset as discussed in Note 1 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\") in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amounts in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss and those recorded as a regulatory asset represent a net periodic benefit cost to be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income in future periods.\n \u2022 an increase in changes in the fair value of natural gas, condensate and NGLs derivatives; \nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment. Because OG&E utilizes various products and generates wastes that are considered hazardous substances for purposes of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, OG&E could be subject to liability for the costs of cleaning up and restoring sites where those substances have been released to the environment. At this time, it is not anticipated that any associated liability will cause a significant impact to OG&E.\n\nThe Company's mission, through OG&E and the Company's equity interest in Enable, is to fulfill its critical role in the nation's electric utility and natural gas midstream pipeline infrastructure and meet individual customer's needs for energy and related services, focusing on safety, efficiency, reliability, customer service and risk management. The Company's corporate strategy is to continue to maintain its existing business mix and diversified asset position of its regulated electric utility business and interest in a publicly traded midstream company, while providing competitive energy products and services to customers, as well as seeking growth opportunities in both businesses.\nNational Ambient Air Quality Standards\nOG&E's Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIf legislation or regulations are passed at the federal or state levels in the future requiring mandatory reductions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases on the Company's facilities, this could result in significant additional compliance costs that would affect the Company's future consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates. Several states outside the area where the Company operates have passed laws, adopted regulations or undertaken regulatory initiatives to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, a deferred tax asset or liability is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities as well as tax credit carry forwards and net operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of the change.\n2018 Capital Requirements, Sources of Financing and Financing Activities\nFuel Inventories. The balance in Fuel Inventories was $57.6 million and $84.3 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $26.7 million, or 31.7 percent, primarily due to decreased coal and gas inventory.\nGross margin is defined by OG&E as operating revenues less cost of sales. Cost of sales, as reflected on the income statement, includes fuel, purchased power and certain transmission expenses. Gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes depreciation and amortization and other operation and maintenance expenses. Expenses for fuel and purchased power are recovered through fuel adjustment clauses, and as a result, changes in these expenses are offset in operating revenues with no impact on net income. OG&E believes gross margin provides a more meaningful basis for evaluating its operations across periods than operating revenues because gross margin excludes the revenue effect of fluctuations in these expenses. Gross margin is used internally to measure performance against budget and in reports for management and the Board of Directors. OG&E's definition of gross margin may be different from similar terms used by other companies. Further, gross margin is not intended to replace operating revenues as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance. For a reconciliation of gross margin to revenue, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, see \"OG&E (Electric Utility) Results of Operations\" below.\nCompany Strategy\nConsolidated OGE\nInvesting Activities\nOther operation and maintenance expense increased $4.0 million, or 0.9 percent, in 2018 as compared to 2017. The below factors contributed to the change in other operation and maintenance expense.\nAllowance for borrowed funds used during construction decreased $6.3 million, or 35.0 percent, primarily due to lower construction work in progress balances resulting from certain environmental projects being completed and placed into service.\nCost of sales for OG&E consists of fuel used in electric generation, purchased power and transmission-related charges. The actual cost of fuel used in electric generation and certain purchased power costs are passed through to OG&E's customers through fuel adjustment clauses. The fuel adjustment clauses are subject to periodic review by the OCC and the APSC. OG&E's cost of sales decreased $5.1 million, or 0.6 percent, in 2018 as compared to 2017. The below factors contributed to the change in cost of sales.\nof deferred costs and flowback of deferred credits generally results from specific decisions by regulators granting such ratemaking treatment.\n (B) Other operations primarily includes the operations of OGE Energy and consolidating eliminations. \nThe following tables represents summarized financial information of Enable for 2018, 2017 and 2016:\nThe difference between OGE Energy's investment in Enable and its underlying equity in the net assets of Enable was $680.3 million as of December 31, 2018. The following table reconciles the basis difference in Enable from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018.\n\nOG&E, as a regulated utility, is subject to accounting principles for certain types of rate-regulated activities, which provide that certain incurred costs that would otherwise be charged to expense can be deferred as regulatory assets, based on the expected recovery from customers in future rates. Likewise, certain actual or anticipated credits that would otherwise reduce expense can be deferred as regulatory liabilities, based on the expected flowback to customers in future rates. Management's expected recovery\n\nOGE Holdings (Natural Gas Midstream Operations)\n (C) Includes expected recoveries of costs incurred for OG&E's railcar operating lease obligations, OG&E's expected cogeneration energy payments, OG&E's minimum fuel purchase commitments and OG&E's expected wind purchase commitments. \nThe Company does not expect to issue any common stock in 2019 from its Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. See Note 9 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for a discussion of the Company's common stock activity.\nAt the end of the lease term, which was February 1, 2019, OG&E had the option to either purchase the railcars at a stipulated fair market value or renew the lease. If OG&E chose not to purchase the railcars or renew the lease agreement and the actual fair value of the railcars was less than the stipulated fair market value, OG&E would have been responsible for the difference in those values up to a maximum of $16.2 million. OG&E was also required to maintain all of the railcars it had under the operating lease.\n \u2022 providing exceptional customer experiences by continuing to improve customer interfaces, tools, products and services that deliver high customer satisfaction and operating productivity; \n (B) Decreased during the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to new Oklahoma rates being implemented on July 1, 2018 and new rates being implemented for Arkansas customers in October 2018, both of which reflected the lower corporate federal tax rate as a result of the 2017 Tax Act, as well as the Oklahoma and Arkansas tax refunds to customers during the July 2018 and October 2018 billing cycles, respectively, for amounts reserved in previous months during 2018 prior to the implementation of new rates. \nThe Company's dividend policy is reviewed by the Board of Directors at least annually and is based on numerous factors, including management's estimation of the long-term earnings power of its businesses. At the Company's September 2018 board meeting, the Board of Directors approved management's recommendation of a 10 percent increase in the quarterly dividend rate to $0.3650 per share from $0.3325 per share effective in October 2018.\nCash and Cash Equivalents. The balance in Cash and Cash Equivalents was $94.3 million and $14.4 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $79.9 million, primarily due to normal business operations and quarterly distributions received from Enable, which the Company elected to apply towards payment of the $250.0 million senior notes due on January 15, 2019.\n \u2022 The increase in net loss of other operations of $12.1 million, or $0.06 per diluted share of the Company's common stock, was primarily due to income tax expense of $10.5 million as a result of the 2017 Tax Act. \nThe increase in transportation and storage business segment operating income was primarily due to the following:\nThe Dry Scrubber system on Sooner Unit 1 completed certain emission testing in October 2018 and was placed into service. The Dry Scrubber system on Sooner Unit 2 completed certain emission testing in January 2019 and was placed into service. More detail regarding the ECP can be found under \"Pending Regulatory Matters\" in Note 15 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\n\n (D) Beginning with the July 2018 invoice, billings reflected the lower corporate federal tax rate enacted by the 2017 Tax Act, as discussed in Note 15 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" \nThe Company continues to monitor these processes and their possible impact on its operations but, at this time, cannot determine with any certainty whether they will cause a material impact to the Company's financial results.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's contractual obligations at December 31, 2018. See the Company's Consolidated Statements of Capitalization and Note 14 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information.\nDistributions by Enable\n\nAs of December 31, 2018, OG&E has a noncancellable operating lease with a purchase option, covering 1,093 rotary gondola railcars to transport coal from Wyoming to OG&E's coal-fired generation units. Rental payments are charged to fuel expense and are recovered through OG&E's tariffs and fuel adjustment clauses.\nEnable's business is impacted by commodity prices which have declined and otherwise experienced significant volatility in recent years. Commodity prices impact the drilling and production of natural gas and crude oil in the areas served by Enable's systems, and the volumes on Enable's systems are negatively impacted if producers decrease drilling and production in those areas served. Both Enable's gathering and processing segment and Enable's transportation and storage segment can be impacted by drilling and production. Enable's gathering and processing segment primarily serve producers, and many producers utilize the services provided by Enable's transportation and storage segment. A decrease in volumes will decrease the cash flows from Enable's systems. A portion of our earnings and operating cash flows depend on the performance of, and distributions from, Enable. As disclosed in this Form 10-K, Enable is subject to a number of risks, including contract renewal risk, the reliance on the drilling and production decisions of others and the volatility of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil prices. If any of those risks were to occur, the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOperating Activities\n\nCustomer balances are generally written off if not collected within six months after the final billing date. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for OG&E is calculated by multiplying the last six months of electric revenue by the provision rate, which is based on a 12-month historical average of actual balances written off. To the extent the historical collection rates are not representative of future collections, there could be an effect on the amount of uncollectible expense recognized. Also, a portion of the uncollectible provision related to fuel within the Oklahoma jurisdiction is being recovered through the fuel adjustment clause. At December 31, 2018, if the provision rate were to increase or decrease by 10 percent, this would cause a change in the uncollectible expense recognized of $0.2 million. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is a reduction to Accounts Receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is included in the Other Operation and Maintenance Expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $1.7 million and $1.5 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n \u2022 A decrease in net income at OGE Holdings of $216.4 million, or $1.08 per diluted share of the Company's common stock, was primarily due to lower income tax benefit due to an adjustment in 2017 resulting from the 2017 Tax Act, partially offset by higher equity in earnings of Enable due to increased revenues from Enable's gathering and processing business driven by higher processed volumes and higher natural gas gathering fees and gathered volumes. \n\nThe Company's consolidated estimates of capital expenditures for the years 2019 through 2023 are shown in the following table. These capital expenditures represent the base maintenance capital expenditures (i.e., capital expenditures to maintain and operate the Company's businesses) plus capital expenditures for known and committed projects. Estimated capital expenditures for Enable are not included in the table below.\nOGE Holdings' earnings before taxes increased $35.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period of 2016, primarily due to an increase in equity in earnings of Enable of $29.4 million and a decrease in pension settlement expense of $6.8 million. The following table presents summarized information regarding Enable's income statement changes for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, and the corresponding impact those changes had on the Company's equity in earnings of Enable.\n\nClimate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emissions\nThe EPA is required to set NAAQS for certain pollutants considered to be harmful to public health or the environment. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to review each NAAQS every five years. As a result of these reviews, the EPA periodically has taken action to adopt more stringent NAAQS for those pollutants. If any areas of Oklahoma were to be designated as not attaining the NAAQS for a particular pollutant, the Company could be required to install additional emission controls on its facilities to help the state achieve attainment with the NAAQS. As of December 31, 2018, no areas of Oklahoma had been designated as non-attainment for pollutants that are likely to affect the Company's operations. Several processes are under way to designate areas in Oklahoma as attaining or not attaining revised NAAQS.\nAir\nThe Company is a holding company with investments in energy and energy services providers offering physical delivery and related services for both electricity and natural gas primarily in the south central U.S. The Company conducts these activities through two business segments: (i) electric utility and (ii) natural gas midstream operations. The accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. The Company generally uses the equity method of accounting for investments where its ownership interest is between 20 percent and 50 percent and it lacks the power to direct activities that most significantly impact economic performance.\nFinancing Activities\nThe Company projects the earnings contribution from its ownership interest in Enable for 2019 to be approximately $104 million to $117 million, or $0.52 to $0.58 per average diluted share, and receive approximately $140 million in cash distributions.\n\nTotal capital requirements, consisting of capital expenditures and maturities of long-term debt, were $823.7 million, and contractual obligations, net of recoveries through fuel adjustment clauses, were $76.4 million, resulting in total net capital requirements and contractual obligations of $900.1 million in 2018, of which $139.8 million was to comply with environmental regulations. This compares to net capital requirements of $1,049.2 million and net contractual obligations of $78.8 million totaling $1,128.0 million in 2017, of which $213.9 million was to comply with environmental regulations.\nAllowance for equity funds used during construction increased $25.5 million, primarily due to higher construction work in progress balances resulting from increased spending for environmental projects.\nOn September 7, 2016, the EPA finalized an update to the 2011 CSAPR. The new rule applies to ozone-season NOX in 22 eastern states (including Oklahoma), utilizes a cap and trade program for NOX emissions and went into effect on May 1, 2017. The rule reduces the 2016 CSAPR emissions cap for all seven of OG&E's coal and gas facilities by 47 percent combined. OG&E and numerous other parties filed petitions for judicial and administrative review of the 2016 rule. Oral argument before the D.C. Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals was held on October 3, 2018.\nCapital Expenditures\nOn October 23, 2015, the EPA published the final Clean Power Plan that established standards of performance for CO2 emissions from existing fossil-fuel-fired power plants along with state-specific CO2 reduction standards expressed as both rate-based (lbs./MWh) and mass-based (tons/yr.) goals. However, the rule was challenged in court when it was issued, and the U.S. Supreme Court issued orders staying implementation of the Clean Power Plan on February 9, 2016 pending resolution of the court\nOG&E Railcar Lease Agreement\n (A) Increased primarily due to annual salary increases and an increase in incentive compensation. \nGross margin is defined by Enable as total revenues minus costs of natural gas and NGLs, excluding depreciation and amortization. Total revenues consist of the fees that Enable charges its customers and the sales price of natural gas and NGLs that Enable sells. The cost of natural gas and NGLs consists of the purchase price of natural gas and NGLs that Enable purchases. Enable deducts the cost of natural gas and NGLs from total revenues to arrive at a measure of the core profitability of their mix of fee-based and commodity-based customer arrangements. Gross margin allows for meaningful comparison of the operating results between Enable's fee-based revenues and Enable's commodity-based contracts which involve the purchase or sale of natural gas, NGLs and/or crude oil. In addition, the Company believes gross margin allows for a meaningful comparison of the results of Enable's commodity-based activities across different commodity price environments because it measures the spread between the product sales price and cost of products sold. Enable's definition of gross margin may be different from similar terms used by other companies. Further, gross margin is not intended to replace operating revenues as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance. For a reconciliation of gross margin to revenue, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented with GAAP, for the years ending December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, see \"OGE Holdings (Natural Gas Midstream Operations) Results of Operations\" below.\nAdditional capital expenditures beyond those identified in the table above, including additional incremental growth opportunities in electric transmission assets, will be evaluated based upon their impact upon achieving the Company's financial objectives.\nWaste\nEnable's gathering and processing business segment reported an increase in operating income of $137.0 million. The following table presents summarized information regarding Enable's gathering and processing business segment income statement changes for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, and the corresponding impact those changes had on the Company's equity in earnings of Enable.\nOGE Holdings' earnings before taxes increased $15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to an increase in equity in earnings of Enable of $21.6 million, partially offset by an increase in other expense and an increase in operation and maintenance expense. The following table presents summarized information regarding Enable's income statement changes for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, and the corresponding impact those changes had on the Company's equity in earnings of Enable.\n (C) Decrease in transmission-related charges was primarily due to lower SPP charges driven by lower rates charged to OG&E for transmission service as a result of lower tax rates due to the 2017 Tax Act. \nIncome tax expense decreased $101.8 million, or 71.8 percent, primarily due to a reduction in the corporate federal tax rate, an increase in the amortization of net unfunded deferred taxes, an increase in state tax credit generation and lower pre-tax income.\nEnvironmental regulation can increase the cost of planning, design, initial installation and operation of OG&E's facilities. Management continues to evaluate its compliance with existing and proposed environmental legislation and regulations and implement appropriate environmental programs in a competitive market.\n (B) Decreased primarily due to additional reserves for rate refunds in both Oklahoma and Arkansas, as well as riders moving to base rates in the March 2017 OCC rate order. \nEnable's Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n (A) Decrease in fuel expense during the year ended 2018 was primarily due to lower fuel prices and decreased utilization of company-owned generation. \nIncome tax expense was $37.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to income tax benefit of $195.2 million during the same period in 2017. The change is primarily due to the remeasurement of federal deferred taxes in 2017 as a result of the 2017 Tax Act.\nA security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Such rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the credit rating agency, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\ndecrease in firm transportation services between Carthage, Texas and Perryville, Louisiana and a decrease in realized gains on natural gas derivatives.\nIn March 2017, the Company and OG&E entered into unsecured five-year revolving credit agreements totaling $900.0 million ($450.0 million for the Company and $450.0 million for OG&E). Each of the facilities contained an option, which could be exercised up to two times, to extend the term of the respective facility for an additional year. Effective March 9, 2018, the Company and OG&E utilized one of those extensions to extend the maturity of their respective credit facility from March 8, 2022 to March 8, 2023.\nOG&E's operations generate wastes that are subject to the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 as well as comparable state laws which impose detailed requirements for the handling, storage, treatment and disposal of waste.\nEnvironmental Laws and Regulations\n \u2022 The increase in net income at OG&E of $21.4 million, or $0.11 per diluted share of the Company's common stock, was primarily due to higher net other income driven by increased allowance for equity funds used during construction as environmental and large capital projects were in progress during the year and lower depreciation and amortization expense as a result of the March 2017 OCC rate order mandating a reduction in depreciation rates. These increases were partially offset by higher income tax expense, higher operation and maintenance expense as a result of increased spending on vegetation management and lower gross margin primarily due to milder weather. \nOther income decreased $22.5 million, or 61.5 percent, primarily due to a decrease in the tax gross-up related to lower allowance for funds used during construction and a change in the presentation of guaranteed flat bill margins, which are now included in gross margin due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard (ASC 606).\nAccess to reasonably priced capital is dependent in part on credit and security ratings. Generally, lower ratings lead to higher financing costs. Pricing grids associated with the Company's credit facilities could cause annual fees and borrowing rates to increase if an adverse rating impact occurs. The impact of any future downgrade could include an increase in the costs of the Company's short-term borrowings, but a reduction in the Company's credit ratings would not result in any defaults or accelerations. Any future downgrade could also lead to higher long-term borrowing costs and, if below investment grade, would require the Company to post collateral or letters of credit.\n \u2022 normal weather patterns are experienced for the remainder of the year; \nAccrued Compensation. The balance of Accrued Compensation was $47.8 million and $35.9 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $11.9 million, or 33.1 percent, primarily due to higher accruals for incentive compensation, partially offset by a lower amount of accrued vacation.\nSee Note 2 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for discussion of current accounting pronouncements that are applicable to the Company.\nEnable's gathering and processing business segment reported an increase in operating income of $131.0 million. The following table presents summarized information regarding Enable's gathering and processing business segment income statement changes for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, and the corresponding impact those changes had on the Company's equity in earnings of Enable.\nincorporate higher capital spending plans and the effects of the 2017 Tax Act, and uncertainty regarding regulatory risk. The revised outlooks did not trigger any collateral requirements or change fees under the revolving credit agreements.\nThe increase in the Company's equity in earnings of Enable was primarily due to the following:\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nTransportation and storage gross margin increased primarily due to an increase in gross margin from changes in the fair value of natural gas derivatives, an increase in NGL sales due to an increase in transported volumes and NGL prices and an increase in off-system transportation margins. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in system management activities, a\n\nAccounts Payable. The balance of Accounts Payable was $239.3 million and $230.4 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $8.9 million, or 3.9 percent, primarily due to the timing of vendor payments.\nDue to the pending litigation and administrative proceedings, the ultimate timing and impact of the 2016 CSAPR update rule on our operations cannot be determined with certainty at this time. However, the Company does not anticipate additional capital expenditures beyond what has already been disclosed and does not expect that the reduced emissions cap, if upheld, will have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\ndegree of difference equaling one cooling degree day. If the calculated average is below 65 degrees, then the difference between the calculated average and 65 is expressed as heating degree days, with each degree of difference equaling one heating degree day. The daily calculations are then totaled for the particular reporting period.\n (B) Increase in the cost of purchases from the SPP was due to an increase of 26.8 percent in MWh purchased and an increase of 16.2 percent in cost per MWhs purchased. The increase in cost per MWh purchased was due to an increase in fuel prices and higher grid congestion costs during 2017. \nThe activities of the Company are subject to numerous stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection. These laws and regulations can change, restrict or otherwise impact the Company's business activities in many ways, including the handling or disposal of waste material, planning for future construction activities to avoid or mitigate harm to threatened or endangered species and requiring the installation and operation of emissions control equipment. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Management believes that all of its operations are in substantial compliance with current federal, state and local environmental standards.\n (C) Increase in transmission-related charges was primarily due to higher SPP charges for the base plan projects of other utilities. \n\nManagement expects that cash generated from operations, proceeds from the issuance of long- and short-term debt, proceeds from the sales of common stock to the public through the Company's Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan or other offerings and distributions from Enable will be adequate over the next three years to meet anticipated cash needs and to fund future growth opportunities. The Company utilizes short-term borrowings (through a combination of bank borrowings and commercial paper) to satisfy temporary working capital needs and as an interim source of financing capital expenditures until permanent financing is arranged.\nThe decrease in transportation and storage business segment operating income was primarily due to the following:\nDerivative instruments have been used at times in managing OG&E's commodity price exposure. The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, provides for regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission of certain commodity-related contracts. Although OG&E qualifies for an end-user exception from mandatory clearing of commodity-related swaps, these regulations could affect the ability of OG&E to participate in these markets and could add additional regulatory oversight over its contracting activities.\nFederal Clean Air Act Overview\nFurther discussion can be found in Note 15 within \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nOG&E (Electric Utility)\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 as compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates includes the Company's share of Enable earnings adjusted for the amortization of the basis difference of the Company's investment in Enogex LLC and its underlying equity in the net assets of Enable and is also adjusted for the elimination of the Enogex Holdings fair value adjustments.\n (A) Increased during 2017 primarily due to more storm costs exceeding the $2.7 million OCC-allowed threshold, which were moved to a regulatory asset, as well as mutual assistance, which was provided in the aftermath of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. \n \u2022 a decrease in revenues from natural gas sales less the cost of natural gas primarily due to a decrease due to lower average prices partially offset by higher sales volumes and an increase in fuel costs; and \nin depreciation rates, higher allowance for equity funds used during construction, higher other income and higher allowance for borrowed funds used during construction, partially offset by higher income tax expense, higher operation and maintenance expense, lower gross margin and higher interest on long-term debt.\nThe railcar lease was recorded on the Company's 2019 Balance Sheet upon adoption of the new leases standard (ASC 842).\nSite Remediation\nThe following table indicates the sensitivity of the Pension Plan funded status to these variables.\n2017 compared to 2016. OG&E's net income increased $21.4 million, or 7.5 percent, in 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily due to lower depreciation and amortization expense as a result of the March 2017 OCC rate order mandating a reduction\n (B) Increase in the cost of purchases from the SPP for the year ended 2018 was due to a 21.1 percent increase in MWhs purchased, partially offset by a 9.0 percent decrease in cost per MWhs purchased due to a decrease in fuel prices. \n\nAdditionally, the Company wants to achieve a premium valuation of its businesses relative to its peers, grow earnings per share with a stable earnings pattern, create a high performance culture and achieve desired outcomes with target stakeholders. The Company's financial objectives include a long-term annual earnings growth rate for OG&E of four to six percent on a weather-normalized basis, maintaining a strong credit rating as well as targeting dividend increases of approximately 10 percent annually through 2019. The Company also utilizes cash distributions from its investment in Enable to help fund its capital needs and support future dividend growth. The Company believes it can accomplish these financial objectives by, among other things, pursuing multiple avenues to build its business, maintaining a diversified asset position, continuing to develop a wide range of skills to succeed with changes in its industries, providing products and services to customers efficiently, managing risks effectively and having strong regulatory and legislative relationships.\nHazardous Air Pollutants Emission Standards\nOG&E has the necessary regulatory approvals to incur up to $800.0 million in short-term borrowings at any one time for a two-year period beginning January 1, 2019 and ending December 31, 2020. See Note 11 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for further discussion of the Company's short-term debt activity.\nThe Company projects OG&E to earn approximately $311 million to $325 million, or $1.55 to $1.62 per average diluted share, in 2019 and is based on the following assumptions:\n \u2022 an increase in revenues from NGLs sales less the cost of NGLs, partially offset by higher average NGLs prices and higher processed volumes in the Anadarko and Ark-La-Tex Basins; and \nReconciliation of Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates\nOG&E is focused on:\n \u2022 An increase in net income at OG&E of $22.5 million, or $0.11 per diluted share of the Company's common stock, was primarily due to higher gross margin due to favorable weather (reduced by lower customer rates which were offset by lower income tax expense). This increase was partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense, primarily due to a reduction in depreciation expense recorded in March 2017 for the period from July 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016 resulting from the March 2017 OCC rate order, and higher interest expense driven by increased debt outstanding during 2018 and decreased allowance for borrowed funds used during construction as environmental and large capital projects have been completed. \n \u2022 continuing focus on operational excellence and efficiencies in order to protect the customer bill. \nThe application of income tax law is complex. Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and often ambiguous. Interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time. Accordingly, it is necessary to make judgments regarding income tax exposure. As a result, changes in these judgments can materially affect amounts the Company recognized in its consolidated financial statements. Tax positions taken by the Company on its income tax returns that are recognized in the financial statements must satisfy a more likely than not recognition threshold, assuming that the position will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information. See Note 8 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for discussion of the effects of the 2017 Tax Act and other tax policies.\nchallenges. The EPA published a proposal on October 16, 2017 to repeal the Clean Power Plan. On August 31, 2018, without acting on the proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan, the EPA published the Affordable Clean Energy Rule, a proposed rule to replace the Clean Power Plan. The ultimate timing and impact of these standards on OG&E's operations cannot be determined with certainty at this time, although a requirement for significant reduction of CO2 emissions from existing fossil-fuel-fired power plants ultimately could result in significant additional compliance costs that would affect the Company's future consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.\nDetailed below is a reconciliation of gross margin to revenue included in the 2019 Outlook.\n\nSummary of Operating Results\nOG&E's cost of sales increased $17.5 million, or 2.0 percent, in 2017 as compared to 2016. The below factors contributed to the change in cost of sales.\n \u2022 a decrease due to intercompany management fees. \nThe increase in Enable's gathering and processing business segment operating income was primarily due to the following:\nWater\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is confronted with issues or events that may result in a contingent liability. These generally relate to lawsuits or claims made by third parties, including governmental agencies. When appropriate, management consults with legal counsel and other experts to assess the claim. If, in management's opinion, the Company has incurred a probable loss as set forth by GAAP, an estimate is made of the loss, and the appropriate accounting entries are reflected in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. At the present time, based on available information, the Company believes that any reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued amounts arising out of pending or threatened lawsuits or claims would not be quantitatively material to its financial statements and would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Notes 14 and 15 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings\" for a discussion of the Company's commitments and contingencies.\nOn May 22, 2015, the EPA issued a final rule to address the provisions in the SIPs of 36 states (including Oklahoma) regarding the treatment of emissions that occur during startup, shutdown and malfunction operations. The final rule clarifies the EPA's Startup, Shutdown and Malfunction Policy. Although judicial challenges to the rule are ongoing, the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality submitted a SIP revision for the EPA's approval on November 7, 2016 to comply with this rule. This rule has resulted in permit modifications for certain OG&E units. The Company does not anticipate capital expenditures or a material impact to its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, as a result of adoption of this rule.\n (A) Decrease in fuel expense was primarily due to decreased utilization of company-owned generation. \nAt December 31, 2018, 32.4 percent of the Pension Plan investments were in listed common stocks with the balance primarily invested in corporate fixed income, other securities and U.S. Treasury notes and bonds as presented in Note 12 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" During 2018, actual losses on the Pension Plan were $39.2 million, compared to expected return on plan assets of $44.1 million. During the same time, corporate bond yields, which are used in determining the discount rate for future pension obligations, decreased. Funding levels are dependent on returns on plan assets and future discount rates. The Company made a $15.0 million and $20.0 million contribution to its Pension Plan in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company has not determined whether it will need to make any contributions to the Pension Plan in 2019. The Company could be required to make additional contributions if the value of its pension trust and postretirement benefit plan trust assets are adversely impacted by a major market disruption in the future.\nThe increase of $346.7 million in net cash used in financing activities in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to the issuance of less long-term debt by OG&E in 2018, a decrease in short-term debt and additional long-term debt paid off in 2018.\nCash Flows\nFinancing Activities and Future Sources of Financing\n (A) Represent capital costs associated with OG&E's ECP to comply with the EPA's Regional Haze Rule. More detailed discussion regarding the Regional Haze Rule and OG&E's ECP can be found in Notes 14 and 15 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and in \"Environmental Laws and Regulations\" below. \nThe increase of $166.6 million, or 21.2 percent, in net cash provided from operating activities in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in vendor payments and an increase in amounts received from customers at OG&E.\nPursuant to the Enable Limited Partnership Agreement, Enable made distributions of $141.2 million, $141.2 million and $141.2 million to the Company during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As required by Enable's Limited Partnership Agreement and General Partner Agreement, respectively, the last permitted distribution date is 60 days after the close of each quarter, and the distribution deadline is five days following distributions by Enable.\nSecurity Ratings\nAs of December 31, 2018, OG&E has 440 MWs of QF contracts with AES and Oklahoma Cogeneration LLC to meet its current and future expected customer needs. The QF contract with AES expired on January 15, 2019, and the QF contract with Oklahoma Cogeneration LLC expires on August 31, 2019. On December 20, 2018, OG&E announced its plan to acquire power plants from AES and Oklahoma Cogeneration LLC, pending regulatory approval, to meet customers' energy needs. Further discussion can be found in Notes 14 and 15 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nIncome tax benefit was $195.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to income tax expense of $40.5 million during the same period in 2016. The change is primarily due to a remeasurement of federal deferred taxes related to the 2017 Tax Act, a remeasurement of state deferred taxes and return to provision adjustments related to the Company's investment in Enable during the year ended December 31, 2016, offset by higher pre-tax operating income.\nOG&E participates in the SPP Integrated Marketplace. As part of the Integrated Marketplace, the SPP has balancing authority responsibilities for its market participants. The SPP Integrated Marketplace functions as a centralized dispatch, where market participants, including OG&E, submit offers to sell power to the SPP from their resources and bid to purchase power from the SPP for their customers. The SPP Integrated Marketplace is intended to allow the SPP to optimize supply offers and demand bids based upon reliability and economic considerations and to determine which generating units will run at any given time for maximum cost-effectiveness within the SPP area. As a result, OG&E's generating units produce output that is different from OG&E's customer load requirements. Net fuel and purchased power costs are recovered through fuel adjustment clauses.\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nOn July 11, 2018, Moody's Investors Service lowered its rating from A3 to Baa1 for the Company and from A1 to A2 for OG&E with both companies having negative outlooks. The Oklahoma regulatory environment and the 2017 Tax Act were both cited by Moody's Investors Service as contributing factors to the credit downgrade. Moody's Investors Service indicated that the negative outlook for OG&E is a reflection of current capital expenditures relating to environmental projects, upcoming debt maturities over the next year and decreased cash flow as a result of the 2017 Tax Act. In addition to the OG&E impacts, Moody's Investors Service indicated that the negative outlook for the Company is a reflection of Enable's business risk, due to the volatility of the oil and gas industry, which Moody's Investors Service indicated could lead to decreased distributions.\n \u2022 an increase in other firm transportation and storage services due to new interstate and intrastate transportation contracts; \nFor Oklahoma jurisdictional revenues, OG&E reserved the excess income taxes collected in current rates, plus interest, from January 2018 through June 2018, and any amortization of excess accumulated deferred income taxes associated with the 2017 Tax Act, which was refunded to Oklahoma customers, as approved by the OCC, during the July 2018 billing cycle. For Arkansas jurisdictional revenues, OG&E reserved the excess income taxes collected in current rates, plus carrying charges, from January 2018 through September 2018, as the Tax Adjustment Rider became effective on October 1, 2018. For FERC jurisdictional revenues, based on an order received from the FERC, OG&E reserved the excess income taxes collected in current rates from January 2018 through June 2018, as the new tax rate was reflected in billings beginning with the July 2018 invoice. Further, for Arkansas and FERC jurisdictional revenues, OG&E is also reserving any amortization of excess accumulated deferred income taxes associated with the 2017 Tax Act.\nOG&E's operations are subject to the Federal Clean Water Act and comparable state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations impose detailed requirements and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state and federal waters.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 as compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nUnbilled Revenues\nregulatory assets and liabilities and unbilled revenues. The selection, application and disclosure of the following critical accounting estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. The Company discusses its significant accounting policies, including those that do not require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates, in Note 1 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nThe following discussion and analysis presents factors that affected the Company's consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 and the Company's consolidated financial position at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The following information should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. Known trends and contingencies of a material nature are discussed to the extent considered relevant.\nRecent Developments and Regulatory Matters\nAccounts Receivable and Accrued Unbilled Revenues. The balance of Accounts Receivable and Accrued Unbilled Revenues was $237.3 million and $257.1 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $19.8 million, or 7.7 percent, primarily due to a decrease in billings to OG&E's retail customers.\n \u2022 an increase in volume-dependent transportation primarily due to an increase in commodity fees from new contracts and an increase in off-system transportation due to increases in volumes at higher rates; and \nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nAir Quality Control System\n* Greater than a 100 percent variance.\nEndangered Species\nOG&E has significant seasonality in its earnings. OG&E typically shows the majority of its earnings in the second and third quarters due to the seasonal nature of air conditioning demand.\nOn March 5, 2018, S&P's Global Ratings revised the rating outlooks on the Company and OG&E from stable to negative. S&P's Global Ratings indicated that the revised outlooks reflect the limited cushion in company financial measures, which\n \u2022 having strong regulatory and legislative relationships for the long-term benefit of our customers, investors and members; \n\n\n\n \u2022 an effective tax rate of approximately 9.9 percent; and \nWorking Capital\nIncome tax expense increased $27.4 million, or 24.0 percent, primarily due to higher pre-tax operating income and lower tax credits generated.\nIn December 2018, OG&E filed a general rate review with the OCC, requesting a rate increase to recover its investments in the Dry Scrubbers project and in the conversion of Muskogee Units 4 and 5 to natural gas to comply with the Regional Haze Rule. The filing also seeks to align OG&E's return on equity more closely to the industry average and to align OG&E's depreciation rates to more realistically reflect its assets' lifespans.\n \u2022 gross margin on revenues of approximately $1.416 billion to $1.421 billion based on sales growth of approximately one percent on a weather-adjusted basis; \n\nOther operation and maintenance expense increased $18.6 million, or 4.1 percent, in 2017 as compared to 2016. The below factors contributed to the change in other operation and maintenance expense.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nThe Company has sought and will continue to seek pollution prevention opportunities and to evaluate the effectiveness of its waste reduction, reuse and recycling efforts. In 2018, the Company obtained refunds of $1.9 million from the recycling of scrap metal, salvaged transformers and used transformer oil. This figure does not include the additional savings gained through the reduction and/or avoidance of disposal costs and the reduction in material purchases due to the reuse of existing materials. Similar savings are anticipated in future years.\nThe decrease of $245.9 million, or 29.9 percent, in net cash used in investing activities in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures primarily related to environmental and large capital projects at OG&E.\n (A) Includes an income tax benefit of $245.2 million in 2017 due to the remeasurement of deferred taxes, as a result of the 2017 Tax Act. \nIn August 2018, OG&E issued $400.0 million of 3.80 percent senior notes due August 15, 2028. The proceeds from the issuance were added to OG&E's general funds to be used for general corporate purposes, including to fund the payment of OG&E's $250.0 million of 6.35 percent senior notes that matured on September 1, 2018, to repay short-term debt and to fund ongoing capital expenditures and working capital.\nTo satisfy the FIP, OG&E installed Dry Scrubbers at Sooner Units 1 and 2 and is converting Muskogee Units 4 and 5 to natural gas. As of December 31, 2018, OG&E has invested $504.3 million in the Dry Scrubbers and $50.5 million in the Muskogee natural gas conversion.\nThe actual cost of fuel used in electric generation (which includes the operating lease obligations for OG&E's railcar leases shown above) and certain purchased power costs are passed on to OG&E's customers through fuel adjustment clauses. Accordingly, while the cost of fuel related to operating leases and the vast majority of minimum fuel purchase commitments of OG&E noted above may increase capital requirements, such costs are recoverable through fuel adjustment clauses and have little, if any, impact on net capital requirements and future contractual obligations. The fuel adjustment clauses are subject to periodic review by the OCC and the APSC.\nOther net periodic benefit expense decreased $7.4 million, or 45.4 percent, primarily due to amortization of unrecognized prior service cost.\n2018 compared to 2017. OG&E's net income increased $22.5 million, or 7.4 percent, in 2018 as compared to 2017, primarily due to higher gross margin (reduced by lower customer rates which were offset by lower income tax expense), partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense, primarily due to a reduction in depreciation expense recorded in March 2017 for the period from July 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016 resulting from the March 2017 OCC rate order, lower other income and higher interest expense.\nThe increase of $150.7 million in net cash provided from financing activities in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to the issuance by OG&E of $300.0 million in long-term debt in each of March 2017 and August 2017, partially offset by a decrease in short-term debt and the payment of $100.0 million in long-term debt in November 2017.\n \u2022 interest expense of approximately $143 million to $145 million which assumes a $1.4 million allowance for borrowed funds used during construction reduction to interest expense and assumes a debt issuance of $300 million in the second half of 2019; \nShort-term borrowings generally are used to meet working capital requirements. The Company borrows on a short-term basis, as necessary, by the issuance of commercial paper and by borrowings under its revolving credit agreement. The Company has revolving credit facilities totaling $900.0 million. These bank facilities can also be used as letter of credit facilities. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had no short-term debt outstanding compared to $168.4 million at December 31, 2017. The following tables highlight the Company's short-term debt activity as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nShort-Term Debt and Credit Facilities\nKey assumptions for 2019 include:\nGathering and processing gross margin increased primarily due to the following:\nOG&E recognizes revenue from electric sales when power is delivered to customers. OG&E reads its customers' meters and sends bills to its customers throughout each month. As a result, there is a significant amount of customers' electricity consumption that has not been billed at the end of each month. OG&E accrues an estimate of the revenues for electric sales delivered since the latest billings. Unbilled revenue is presented in Accrued Unbilled Revenues on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and in Operating Revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income based on estimates of usage and prices during the period. At December 31, 2018, if the estimated usage or price used in the unbilled revenue calculation were to increase or decrease by one percent, this would cause a change in the unbilled revenues recognized of $0.4 million. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, Accrued Unbilled Revenues were $62.6 million and $66.5 million, respectively. The estimates that management uses in this calculation could vary from the actual amounts to be paid by customers.\nOGE Holdings\n \u2022 a decrease in changes in the fair value of natural gas derivatives; and \nResults of Operations\nThe EPA's 2005 Regional Haze Rule is intended to protect visibility in certain national parks and wilderness areas throughout the U.S. that may be impacted by air pollutant emissions. On December 28, 2011, the EPA issued a final Regional Haze Rule for Oklahoma which adopted a FIP for SO2 emissions at Sooner Units 1 and 2 and Muskogee Units 4 and 5. The FIP compliance date was January 4, 2019 as a result of an appeal filed by OG&E and others.\n\nTransportation and storage gross margin decreased primarily due to the following:\nGross margin decreased $15.6 million, or 1.1 percent, in 2017 as compared to 2016. The below factors contributed to the change in gross margin.\n (C) Further discussion of OG&E's reserve for tax refund in response to OCC, APSC and FERC proceedings can be found in Notes 8 and 15 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" \nThe Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contain information that is pertinent to Management's Discussion and Analysis. In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Changes to these assumptions and estimates could have a material effect on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. However, the Company believes it has taken reasonable positions where assumptions and estimates are used in order to minimize the negative financial impact to the Company that could result if actual results vary from the assumptions and estimates. In management's opinion, the areas of the Company where the most significant judgment is exercised includes the determination of Pension Plan assumptions, income taxes, contingency reserves, asset retirement obligations and depreciable lives of property, plant and equipment. For the electric utility segment, significant judgment is also exercised in the determination of\nOn September 30, 2015, the EPA finalized a NAAQS for ozone at 70 ppb, which is more stringent than the previous standard of 75 ppb set in 2008. In September 2016, Oklahoma submitted to the EPA the recommendation of \"attainment/unclassifiable\" for all 77 counties in Oklahoma. On June 4, 2018, the EPA published its final determination that there are no nonattainment areas in Oklahoma. Based on this assessment, no material impacts are anticipated at this time.\n (B) Changes are primarily due to the timing of normal plant maintenance. \nOn February 16, 2012, the EPA published the final MATS rule regulating the emissions of certain hazardous air pollutants from electric generating units, which became effective April 16, 2012. The Company complied with the MATS rule by the April\n \u2022 an increase in natural gas gathering fees due to higher fees and gathered volumes in the Anadarko and Ark-La-Tex Basins; \nAccounting Pronouncements\nFuture Capital Requirements\nThere is continuing discussion and evaluation of possible global climate change in certain regulatory and legislative arenas. The focus is generally on emissions of greenhouse gases, including CO2, sulfur hexafluoride and methane, and whether these emissions are contributing to the warming of the earth's atmosphere. On June 1, 2017, President Trump announced that the U.S. will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord and begin negotiations to re-enter the agreement with different terms. A new agreement may result in future additional emissions reductions in the U.S.; however, it is not possible to determine what the international legal standards for greenhouse gas emissions will be in the future and the extent to which these commitments will be implemented through the Clean Air Act or any other existing statutes and new legislation.\nOn August 1, 2018, Fitch Ratings lowered its senior unsecured debt rating from A- to BBB+ for the Company and from A+ to A for OG&E with both companies having stable outlooks. Fitch Ratings cited the regulatory environment in Oklahoma, underscored by the unfavorable rate review outcomes in 2017 and 2018 and uncertainty surrounding regulatory treatment for OG&E's investment in the Dry Scrubbers at Sooner Units 1 and 2, as a key contributing factor to the credit downgrade. Fitch Ratings also indicated that the Company's credit profile reflects Enable's higher operating risks.\nGathering and processing gross margin increased primarily due to an increase in gross margin from natural gas sales due to higher average natural gas prices and higher gathering volumes in the Anadarko and Ark-La-Tex Basins, an increase in processing margins resulting from higher average NGL prices and higher processed volumes in the Anadarko Basin, an increase in gathering margin due to increased gathering volumes in the Anadarko and Ark-La-Tex Basins and increased billings under minimum volume commitments in the Arkoma Basin and an increase in gross margin from changes in the fair value of condensate and NGL derivatives.\nIt is estimated that OG&E's total expenditures to comply with environmental laws, regulations and requirements for 2019 will be $50.0 million, of which $25.5 million is for capital expenditures. The amounts for OG&E include capital expenditures for the Dry Scrubbers at Sooner Units 1 and 2 and the conversion of Muskogee Units 4 and 5 to natural gas. It is estimated that OG&E's total expenditures to comply with environmental laws, regulations and requirements for 2020 will be $22.6 million, of which $0.2 million is for capital expenditures.\nOverview\nAllowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable\nThe following table reconciles OGE Energy's equity in earnings of its unconsolidated affiliates for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nShort-Term Debt. There was no balance of Short-term Debt at December 31, 2018 compared to a balance of $168.4 million at December 31, 2017, respectively, a decrease of $168.4 million. The Company borrows on a short-term basis, as necessary, by the issuance of commercial paper and by borrowings under its revolving credit agreements. The decrease was primarily due to the proceeds of the senior notes issuance in August 2018 being utilized for general corporate purposes instead of borrowing under the Company's revolving credit agreement.\nCommon Stock Dividends\nRegional Haze Control Measures\nIn 2018, the Company's primary sources of capital were cash generated from operations, proceeds from the issuance of long- and short-term debt and distributions from Enable. Changes in working capital reflect the seasonal nature of the Company's business, the revenue lag between billing and collection from customers and fuel inventories. See \"Working Capital\" for a discussion of significant changes in net working capital requirements as it pertains to operating cash flow and liquidity.\nAs a result of the 2017 Tax Act, in early January 2018: (i) the OCC ordered OG&E to record a reserve, including accrued interest, to reflect the reduced federal corporate tax rate, among other tax implications, on an interim basis, subject to refund until utility rates were adjusted to reflect the federal tax savings; (ii) the APSC ordered OG&E to book regulatory liabilities to record the current and deferred impacts of the 2017 Tax Act until the resulting benefits, including carrying charges, are returned to customers; and (iii) through a Section 206 filing with the FERC, modifications were requested to be made to OG&E's transmission formula rates to reflect the impacts of the 2017 Tax Act.\nIncome Taxes\nOn February 8, 2019, Enable announced a quarterly dividend distribution of $0.31800 per unit on its outstanding common units, which is unchanged from the previous quarter. If cash distributions to Enable's unitholders exceed $0.330625 per unit in any quarter, the general partner will receive increasing percentages, up to 50 percent, of the cash Enable distributes in excess of that amount. The Company is entitled to 60 percent of those \"incentive distributions.\"\nWorking capital is defined as the difference in current assets and current liabilities. The Company's working capital requirements are driven generally by changes in accounts receivable, accounts payable, commodity prices, credit extended to and the timing of collections from customers, the level and timing of spending for maintenance and expansion activity, inventory levels and fuel recoveries.\nAllowance for equity funds used during construction decreased $15.9 million, or 40.1 percent, primarily due to lower construction work in progress balances resulting from certain environmental projects being completed and placed into service.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $35.5 million, or 11.2 percent, primarily due to lower depreciation expense related to the reduction in depreciation rates approved in the March 2017 OCC rate order, partially offset by additional assets being placed into service.\n \u2022 an increase in processing service fees resulting from higher processed volumes primarily under fixed processing arrangements in the Anadarko and Ark-La-Tex Basins; \nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n \u2022 providing safe, reliable energy to the communities and customers we serve, with a particular focus on enhancing the value of the grid by improving distribution grid reliability by reducing the frequency and duration of customer interruptions and leveraging previous grid technology investments; \nThe natural gas midstream operations segment represents the Company's investment in Enable through wholly owned subsidiaries and ultimately OGE Holdings. Enable was formed in 2013, and its general partner is equally controlled by the Company and CenterPoint, who each have 50 percent management ownership. Based on the 50/50 management ownership, with neither company having control, the Company accounts for its interest in Enable using the equity method of accounting. Enable is primarily engaged in the business of gathering, processing, transporting and storing natural gas. Enable's natural gas gathering and processing assets are strategically located in four states and serve natural gas production from shale developments in the Anadarko, Arkoma and Ark-La-Tex Basins. Enable also owns a crude oil gathering business in the Anadarko and Williston Basins. Enable has intrastate natural gas transportation and storage assets that are located in Oklahoma as well as interstate assets that extend from western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle to Louisiana, from Louisiana to Illinois and from Louisiana to Alabama. At December 31, 2018, the Company owned 111.0 million common units, or 25.6 percent, of Enable's outstanding units. For additional information on the Company's equity investment in Enable and related party transactions, see Note 4 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\n \u2022 The increase in net income at OGE Holdings of $271.5 million, or $1.36 per diluted share of the Company's common stock, was primarily due to an income tax benefit of $245.2 million as a result of the 2017 Tax Act and an increase of equity in earnings of Enable due to increased revenues from Enable's gathering and processing business driven by higher average natural gas prices and higher gathering volumes as well as higher average NGLs prices and higher processed volumes. ", "item_7_text": "Gross margin increased $14.3 million, or 1.0 percent, in 2018 as compared to 2017. The below factors contributed to the change in gross margin.\nThe increase in Enable's gathering and processing business segment operating income was primarily due to the following:\n (A) Cooling degree days decreased approximately 13 percent in 2017. \n \u2022 an effective tax rate of approximately 4.4 percent; \nOther income increased $20.2 million, primarily due to an increase in the tax gross-up related to higher allowance for funds used during construction and an increase in gains on guaranteed flat bill margins.\nCommon Stock\n \u2022 a decrease in firm transportation services between Carthage, Texas and Perryville, Louisiana due to contract expirations during 2017; partially offset by \n \u2022 approximately 201 million average diluted shares outstanding; \nThe Company has recorded asset retirement obligations that are being accreted over their respective lives ranging from two to 74 years. The inputs used in the valuation of asset retirement obligations include the assumed life of the asset placed into service, the average inflation rate, market risk premium, the credit-adjusted risk free interest rate and the timing of incurring costs related to the retirement of the asset.\n \u2022 A decrease in net loss of other operations of $0.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share of the Company's common stock, was primarily due to lower other operation and maintenance expense and higher income tax benefit. \nOG&E records certain incurred costs and obligations as regulatory assets or liabilities if, based on regulatory orders or other available evidence, it is probable that the costs or obligations will be included in amounts allowable for recovery or refund in future rates. The benefit obligations regulatory asset is comprised of expenses recorded which are probable of future recovery and that have not yet been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost, including net loss and prior service cost.\n (A) Based on the midpoint of OG&E earnings guidance for 2019. \nThe EPA issued a final rule on May 19, 2014 to implement Section 316(b) of the Federal Clean Water Act, which requires that power plant cooling water intake structure location, design, construction and capacity reflect the best available technology for minimizing their adverse environmental impact via the impingement and entrainment of aquatic organisms. The Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality issued final permits on December 22, 2017 and August 22, 2018 for Muskogee Power Plant and Seminole Power Plant, respectively, in compliance with the final 316(b) rule, and OG&E did not incur any material costs associated with the rule's implementation at either location. OG&E expects to be able to provide a reasonable estimate of any material costs associated with the rule's implementation at other facilities following the future issuance of permits from the State of Oklahoma.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangement\n\nOn June 18, 2018, S&P's Global Ratings lowered its issuer credit ratings for the Company and OG&E from A- to BBB+ and revised their rating outlooks from negative to stable. S&P's Global Ratings also lowered its rating on OG&E's senior unsecured notes from A- to BBB+. S&P's Global Ratings indicated that the changes in ratings are a result of the $64.0 million rate decrease in the June 19, 2018 OCC settlement, the existing level of depreciation expense and continued capital spending, which places the Company and OG&E at a higher level of financial risk in S&P's Global Ratings' risk profile. Furthermore, S&P's Global Ratings indicated that the Company's change in credit rating was impacted by Enable's business risk, due to the volatility of the oil and gas industry. However, S&P's Global Ratings indicated that the stable outlook reflects its expectation that the Company and OG&E will be able to manage future regulatory risk in Oklahoma.\nOther Current Liabilities. The balance of Other Current Liabilities was $87.0 million and $28.7 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $58.3 million, primarily due to amounts owed to customers, including the reserve for tax refund of $15.4 million resulting from the 2017 Tax Act, SPP reserves of $29.9 million and over recovery of the SPP cost tracker of $16.8 million.\n (A) The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $245.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the Company remeasuring deferred taxes at OGE Holdings, as a result of the 2017 Tax Act. See Note 8 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for further discussion of the effects of the 2017 Tax Act. \n(A) Excludes condensate.\nIn 2015, the EPA finalized a rule under the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act for the handling and disposal of coal combustion residuals or coal ash. The rule regulates coal ash as a solid waste rather than a hazardous waste, which would have made the management of coal ash more costly. Recent litigation decisions at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals indicate that the EPA will be required to revise certain aspects of this rule. OG&E manages one regulated inactive coal ash impoundment that is expected to be clean-closed in 2019. On June 28, 2018, the EPA approved the State of Oklahoma's application for a state coal ash permitting program that will operate in lieu of the federal coal ash program promulgated under the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The EPA approval of the State of Oklahoma permitting program is currently under litigation. The Company is monitoring regulatory developments relating to this rule, none of which appear to be material to OG&E at this time. OG&E is in compliance with this rule at this time.\nNonetheless, OG&E's current business strategy will result in a reduced carbon emissions rate compared to current levels. As discussed in Note 15 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" under \"Pending Regulatory Matters,\" OG&E's plan to comply with the EPA's MATS rule and Regional Haze Rule FIP includes converting two coal-fired generating units at the Muskogee Station to natural gas, among other measures. OG&E's deployment of Smart Grid technology helps to reduce the peak load demand. OG&E is also deploying more renewable energy sources that do not emit greenhouse gases. OG&E's service territory borders one of the nation's best wind resource areas, and OG&E has leveraged its geographic position to develop renewable energy resources and completed transmission investments to deliver the renewable energy. The SPP has begun to authorize the construction of transmission lines capable of bringing renewable energy out of the wind resource areas in western Oklahoma, the Texas Panhandle and western Kansas to load centers by planning for more transmission to be built in the area. In addition to increasing overall system reliability, these new transmission resources should provide greater access to additional wind resources that are currently constrained due to existing transmission delivery limitations.\nThe increase in the Company's equity in earnings of Enable was primarily due to the following: \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe increase of $201.5 million, or 32.5 percent, in net cash used in investing activities in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures related to multiple environmental and large capital projects at OG&E.\n \u2022 new rates take effect in Oklahoma by July 1, 2019; and \nOG&E\n2017 compared to 2016. Net income was $619.0 million, or $3.10 per diluted share, in 2017 as compared to $338.2 million, or $1.69 per diluted share, in 2016. The increase in net income of $280.8 million, or 83.0 percent, or $1.41 per diluted share, in 2017 as compared to 2016 is further discussed below.\n (B) Cogeneration capacity, fixed operation and maintenance and energy payments will end in 2019, as a result of contract expiration. As described below, OG&E intends to acquire the AES and Oklahoma Cogeneration LLC power plants, pending regulatory approval. \nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nOG&E's operations are subject to the Federal Clean Air Act, as amended, and comparable state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including electric generating units, and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. Such laws and regulations may require that OG&E obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions or result in the increase of existing air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations or install emission control equipment. OG&E likely will be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment and technology in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions.\n2019 Outlook\nCertain federal laws, including the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Endangered Species Act, provide special protection to certain designated species. These laws and any state equivalents provide for significant civil and criminal penalties for unpermitted activities that result in harm to or harassment of certain protected animals and plants, including damage to their habitats. If such species are located in an area in which the Company conducts operations, or if additional species in those areas become subject to protection, the Company's operations and development projects, particularly transmission, wind or pipeline projects, could be restricted or delayed, or the Company could be required to implement expensive mitigation measures.\n (A) Degree days are calculated as follows: The high and low degrees of a particular day are added together and then averaged. If the calculated average is above 65 degrees, then the difference between the calculated average and 65 is expressed as cooling degree days, with each \nEnable Results of Operations\n\n \u2022 every 25 basis point change in the allowed Oklahoma return on equity equates to a change of approximately $9.4 million in revenue. \n\nIn 2015, the EPA issued a final rule addressing the effluent limitation guidelines for power plants under the Federal Clean Water Act. The final rule establishes technology and performance based standards that may apply to discharges of six waste streams including bottom ash transport water. Compliance with this rule will occur by 2023; however, on April 12, 2017, the EPA granted a Petition for Reconsideration of the 2015 Rule. OG&E is evaluating what, if any, compliance actions are needed but is not able to quantify with any certainty what costs may be incurred. OG&E expects to be able to provide a reasonable estimate of any material costs associated with the rule's implementation following issuance of the permits from the State of Oklahoma.\n \u2022 ensuring we have the necessary mix of generation resources to meet the long-term needs of our customers; and \n\nCross-State Air Pollution Rule\nFuture financing requirements may be dependent, to varying degrees, upon numerous factors such as general economic conditions, abnormal weather, load growth, commodity prices, acquisitions of other businesses and/or development of projects, actions by rating agencies, inflation, changes in environmental laws or regulations, rate increases or decreases allowed by regulatory agencies, new legislation and market entry of competing electric power generators.\nThe EPA proposed to designate part of Muskogee County, in which OG&E's Muskogee Power Plant is located, as non-attainment for the 2010 SO2 NAAQS on March 1, 2016, even though nearby monitors indicate compliance with the NAAQS. The proposed designation is based on modeling that does not reflect the planned conversion of two of the coal units at Muskogee to natural gas. OG&E commented that the EPA should defer a designation of the area to allow time for additional monitoring. The State of Oklahoma's revised monitoring plan was approved by the EPA, and the required monitoring commenced at the beginning of 2017 and will continue through the end of 2019. Nonetheless, the EPA has a deadline for making a decision on the designation pursuant to a consent decree entered by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California to resolve a citizen suit. The deadline has been extended several times, with the current deadline being August 26, 2017, but a decision has yet to be reached. It is unclear what impact, if any, the consent decree deadline will have on the monitoring plan. At this time, OG&E cannot determine with any certainty whether the proposed designation of Muskogee County will cause a material impact to OG&E's financial results. The EPA has published final decisions on all other areas of Oklahoma. In this decision, Noble County, in which the Sooner plant is located, was deemed to be in attainment with the 2010 standard.\n16, 2016 deadline that applied to OG&E by installing activated carbon injection for all five coal units. Nonetheless, there is continuing litigation, to which the Company is not a party, challenging whether the EPA had statutory authority to issue the MATS rule. On December 27, 2018, the EPA released a proposed rule reconsidering certain elements of the 2012 rule in response to lengthy litigation in the D.C. Circuit Court. The proposed rule will be available for public comment when it is published in the Federal Register. The Company cannot predict the outcome of this litigation or regulatory proposal or how it will affect the Company.\nOther Current Assets. The balance of Other Current Assets was $29.5 million and $54.6 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $25.1 million, or 46.0 percent, primarily due to increased collections from customers associated with various rate riders.\n\n\nEPA Startup, Shutdown and Malfunction Policy\nThe Company's primary needs for capital are related to acquiring or constructing new facilities and replacing or expanding existing facilities at OG&E. Other working capital requirements are expected to be primarily related to maturing debt, operating lease obligations, fuel clause under and over recoveries and other general corporate purposes. The Company generally meets its cash needs through a combination of cash generated from operations, short-term borrowings (through a combination of bank borrowings and commercial paper) and permanent financings.\n \u2022 a $0.00 to ($0.02) or up to $4 million loss at OGE Energy due to interest expense. \nAsset Retirement Obligations\nFor a further discussion regarding contingencies relating to environmental laws and regulations, see Note 14 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nIn August 2011, the EPA finalized its CSAPR that required 27 states in the eastern half of the U.S. (including Oklahoma) to reduce power plant emissions that contribute to ozone and particulate matter pollution in other states. Litigation challenging the rule delayed the effective date until 2014. Several parties to that litigation, including OG&E, have petitions for review that remain pending although the rule is now effective. Compliance with the CSAPR began in 2015 using the amount of allowances originally scheduled to be available in 2012. OG&E has installed seven low NOX burner systems on two Muskogee units, two Sooner units and three Seminole units and is in compliance.\n \u2022 an increase in system management activities. \nIn December 2018, OG&E filed an application for pre-approval from the OCC to acquire a coal- and natural gas-fired plant from AES and a natural gas-fired combined-cycle plant from Oklahoma Cogeneration LLC in 2019. The purchase of these assets is intended to replace capacity currently provided by power purchase contracts set to expire in 2019 and to help OG&E satisfy its customers' energy needs and load obligations to the SPP.\nContractual Obligations\n \u2022 operating expenses of approximately $941 million to $949 million, with operation and maintenance expenses comprising approximately 50 percent of the total; \nIntroduction\nAllowance for borrowed funds used during construction increased $10.5 million, primarily due to higher construction work in progress balances resulting from increased spending for environmental projects.\nA more detailed discussion regarding the financial performance of OG&E and the Natural Gas Midstream Operations can be found under \"Results of Operations\" below.\nIn January 2018, OG&E filed a general rate review in Oklahoma, seeking recovery of the seven combustion turbines that were part of the Mustang Modernization Plan, requesting an increase in depreciation rates to levels similar with rates in existence prior to the March 2017 OCC rate order and crediting customers for the impacts of the 2017 Tax Act. In June 2018, the OCC approved a Joint Stipulation and Settlement Agreement. As a result of the settlement, new rates were implemented on July 1, 2018.\n\nThe Company has a Pension Plan that covers a significant amount of the Company's employees hired before December 1, 2009. Effective December 1, 2009, the Company's Pension Plan is no longer being offered to employees hired on or after December 1, 2009. The Company also has defined benefit postretirement plans that cover a significant amount of its employees. Pension and other postretirement plan expenses and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by the market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, assumed discount rates and the level of funding. Actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized. The Pension Plan rate assumptions are shown in Note 12 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" The assumed return on plan assets is based on management's expectation of the long-term return on the plan assets portfolio. The discount rate used to compute the present value of plan liabilities is based generally on rates of high-grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which benefits will be paid. Funding levels are dependent on returns on plan assets and future discount rates. Higher returns on plan assets and an increase in discount rates will reduce funding requirements to the Pension Plan.\n (A) Maturities of the Company's long-term debt during the next five years consist of $250.1 million, $0.1 million, $0.1 million, $0.1 million and $0.1 million in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. \nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $40.7 million, or 14.5 percent, primarily due to a reduction in depreciation expense of approximately $20.0 million recorded in March 2017 for the period from July 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016 resulting from the March 2017 OCC rate order, and additional assets being placed into service.\n \u2022 other income of approximately $3.5 million including approximately $3.3 million of allowance for equity funds used during construction; \nThe following operating results analysis by business segment includes intercompany transactions that are eliminated in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n (A) Cooling and heating degree days increased nine percent and 31 percent, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the same periods in 2017. \n\nEnable's transportation and storage business segment reported an increase in operating income of $13.0 million. The following table presents summarized information regarding Enable's transportation and storage business segment income statement changes for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, and the corresponding impact those changes had on the Company's equity in earnings of Enable.\nThe Company's and OG&E's borrowing costs under the credit agreements will increase immaterially as a result of these recent credit downgrades.\n \u2022 an increase in crude oil, condensate and produced water gathering revenues driven by an increase in the Anadarko Basin due to the acquisition of Velocity Holdings, LLC in the fourth quarter of 2018 and an increase in the Williston Basin due to higher gathered volumes, partially offset by a reduction in average rates; partially offset by \nThe electric utility segment generates, transmits, distributes and sells electric energy in Oklahoma and western Arkansas. Its operations are conducted through OG&E and are subject to regulation by the OCC, the APSC and the FERC. OG&E was incorporated in 1902 under the laws of the Oklahoma Territory and is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. OG&E is the largest electric utility in Oklahoma, and its franchised service territory includes Fort Smith, Arkansas and the surrounding communities. OG&E sold its retail natural gas business in 1928 and is no longer engaged in the natural gas distribution business.\nEnable's transportation and storage business segment reported a decrease in operating income of $19.0 million. The following table presents summarized information regarding Enable's transportation and storage business segment income statement changes for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, and the corresponding impact those changes had on the Company's equity in earnings of Enable.\n(B) NGLs sold includes volumes of NGLs withdrawn from inventory or purchased for system balancing purposes.\n2018 compared to 2017. Net income was $425.5 million, or $2.12 per diluted share, in 2018 as compared to $619.0 million, or $3.10 per diluted share, in 2017. The decrease in net income of $193.5 million, or 31.3 percent, or $0.98 per diluted share, in 2018 as compared to 2017 is further discussed below.\nThe increase of $139.8 million, or 21.7 percent, in net cash provided from operating activities in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to increased amounts received from customers, primarily due to recovery of fuel costs, partially offset by an increase in vendor payments.\nMaterials and Supplies, at Average Cost. The balance of Materials and Supplies, at Average Cost was $126.7 million and $80.8 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $45.9 million, or 56.8 percent, primarily due to increased inventory related to long-term service agreements.\nThe Company's 2019 earnings guidance is between approximately $412 million and $442 million of net income, or $2.05 to $2.20 per average diluted share, and is based on the following assumptions:\nResults by Business Segment\n \u2022 continuing to grow a zero-injury culture and deliver top-quartile safety results; \nIssuance of Long-Term Debt\nOn February 1, 2019, OG&E renewed the lease agreement effective February 1, 2019, under similar terms and conditions, for a fleet of 780 railcars, expiring February 1, 2024. The number of railcars was reduced due to the conversion of Muskogee Units 4 and 5 to natural gas. At the end of the lease term, OG&E has the option to either purchase the railcars at a stipulated fair market value or renew the lease. If OG&E chooses not to purchase the railcars or renew the lease agreement and the actual fair value of the railcars is less than the stipulated fair market value, OG&E would be responsible for the difference in those values up to a maximum of $6.8 million.\nThe following table presents the status of the Company's Pension Plan, the Restoration of Retirement Income Plan and the postretirement benefit plans at December 31, 2018 and 2017. These amounts have been recorded in Accrued Benefit Obligations with the offset in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (except OG&E's portion, which is recorded as a regulatory asset as discussed in Note 1 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\") in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amounts in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss and those recorded as a regulatory asset represent a net periodic benefit cost to be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income in future periods.\n \u2022 an increase in changes in the fair value of natural gas, condensate and NGLs derivatives; \nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment. Because OG&E utilizes various products and generates wastes that are considered hazardous substances for purposes of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, OG&E could be subject to liability for the costs of cleaning up and restoring sites where those substances have been released to the environment. At this time, it is not anticipated that any associated liability will cause a significant impact to OG&E.\n\nThe Company's mission, through OG&E and the Company's equity interest in Enable, is to fulfill its critical role in the nation's electric utility and natural gas midstream pipeline infrastructure and meet individual customer's needs for energy and related services, focusing on safety, efficiency, reliability, customer service and risk management. The Company's corporate strategy is to continue to maintain its existing business mix and diversified asset position of its regulated electric utility business and interest in a publicly traded midstream company, while providing competitive energy products and services to customers, as well as seeking growth opportunities in both businesses.\nNational Ambient Air Quality Standards\nOG&E's Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIf legislation or regulations are passed at the federal or state levels in the future requiring mandatory reductions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases on the Company's facilities, this could result in significant additional compliance costs that would affect the Company's future consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates. Several states outside the area where the Company operates have passed laws, adopted regulations or undertaken regulatory initiatives to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, a deferred tax asset or liability is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities as well as tax credit carry forwards and net operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of the change.\n2018 Capital Requirements, Sources of Financing and Financing Activities\nFuel Inventories. The balance in Fuel Inventories was $57.6 million and $84.3 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $26.7 million, or 31.7 percent, primarily due to decreased coal and gas inventory.\nGross margin is defined by OG&E as operating revenues less cost of sales. Cost of sales, as reflected on the income statement, includes fuel, purchased power and certain transmission expenses. Gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes depreciation and amortization and other operation and maintenance expenses. Expenses for fuel and purchased power are recovered through fuel adjustment clauses, and as a result, changes in these expenses are offset in operating revenues with no impact on net income. OG&E believes gross margin provides a more meaningful basis for evaluating its operations across periods than operating revenues because gross margin excludes the revenue effect of fluctuations in these expenses. Gross margin is used internally to measure performance against budget and in reports for management and the Board of Directors. OG&E's definition of gross margin may be different from similar terms used by other companies. Further, gross margin is not intended to replace operating revenues as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance. For a reconciliation of gross margin to revenue, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, see \"OG&E (Electric Utility) Results of Operations\" below.\nCompany Strategy\nConsolidated OGE\nInvesting Activities\nOther operation and maintenance expense increased $4.0 million, or 0.9 percent, in 2018 as compared to 2017. The below factors contributed to the change in other operation and maintenance expense.\nAllowance for borrowed funds used during construction decreased $6.3 million, or 35.0 percent, primarily due to lower construction work in progress balances resulting from certain environmental projects being completed and placed into service.\nCost of sales for OG&E consists of fuel used in electric generation, purchased power and transmission-related charges. The actual cost of fuel used in electric generation and certain purchased power costs are passed through to OG&E's customers through fuel adjustment clauses. The fuel adjustment clauses are subject to periodic review by the OCC and the APSC. OG&E's cost of sales decreased $5.1 million, or 0.6 percent, in 2018 as compared to 2017. The below factors contributed to the change in cost of sales.\nof deferred costs and flowback of deferred credits generally results from specific decisions by regulators granting such ratemaking treatment.\n (B) Other operations primarily includes the operations of OGE Energy and consolidating eliminations. \nThe following tables represents summarized financial information of Enable for 2018, 2017 and 2016:\nThe difference between OGE Energy's investment in Enable and its underlying equity in the net assets of Enable was $680.3 million as of December 31, 2018. The following table reconciles the basis difference in Enable from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018.\n\nOG&E, as a regulated utility, is subject to accounting principles for certain types of rate-regulated activities, which provide that certain incurred costs that would otherwise be charged to expense can be deferred as regulatory assets, based on the expected recovery from customers in future rates. Likewise, certain actual or anticipated credits that would otherwise reduce expense can be deferred as regulatory liabilities, based on the expected flowback to customers in future rates. Management's expected recovery\n\nOGE Holdings (Natural Gas Midstream Operations)\n (C) Includes expected recoveries of costs incurred for OG&E's railcar operating lease obligations, OG&E's expected cogeneration energy payments, OG&E's minimum fuel purchase commitments and OG&E's expected wind purchase commitments. \nThe Company does not expect to issue any common stock in 2019 from its Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. See Note 9 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for a discussion of the Company's common stock activity.\nAt the end of the lease term, which was February 1, 2019, OG&E had the option to either purchase the railcars at a stipulated fair market value or renew the lease. If OG&E chose not to purchase the railcars or renew the lease agreement and the actual fair value of the railcars was less than the stipulated fair market value, OG&E would have been responsible for the difference in those values up to a maximum of $16.2 million. OG&E was also required to maintain all of the railcars it had under the operating lease.\n \u2022 providing exceptional customer experiences by continuing to improve customer interfaces, tools, products and services that deliver high customer satisfaction and operating productivity; \n (B) Decreased during the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to new Oklahoma rates being implemented on July 1, 2018 and new rates being implemented for Arkansas customers in October 2018, both of which reflected the lower corporate federal tax rate as a result of the 2017 Tax Act, as well as the Oklahoma and Arkansas tax refunds to customers during the July 2018 and October 2018 billing cycles, respectively, for amounts reserved in previous months during 2018 prior to the implementation of new rates. \nThe Company's dividend policy is reviewed by the Board of Directors at least annually and is based on numerous factors, including management's estimation of the long-term earnings power of its businesses. At the Company's September 2018 board meeting, the Board of Directors approved management's recommendation of a 10 percent increase in the quarterly dividend rate to $0.3650 per share from $0.3325 per share effective in October 2018.\nCash and Cash Equivalents. The balance in Cash and Cash Equivalents was $94.3 million and $14.4 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $79.9 million, primarily due to normal business operations and quarterly distributions received from Enable, which the Company elected to apply towards payment of the $250.0 million senior notes due on January 15, 2019.\n \u2022 The increase in net loss of other operations of $12.1 million, or $0.06 per diluted share of the Company's common stock, was primarily due to income tax expense of $10.5 million as a result of the 2017 Tax Act. \nThe increase in transportation and storage business segment operating income was primarily due to the following:\nThe Dry Scrubber system on Sooner Unit 1 completed certain emission testing in October 2018 and was placed into service. The Dry Scrubber system on Sooner Unit 2 completed certain emission testing in January 2019 and was placed into service. More detail regarding the ECP can be found under \"Pending Regulatory Matters\" in Note 15 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\n\n (D) Beginning with the July 2018 invoice, billings reflected the lower corporate federal tax rate enacted by the 2017 Tax Act, as discussed in Note 15 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" \nThe Company continues to monitor these processes and their possible impact on its operations but, at this time, cannot determine with any certainty whether they will cause a material impact to the Company's financial results.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's contractual obligations at December 31, 2018. See the Company's Consolidated Statements of Capitalization and Note 14 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information.\nDistributions by Enable\n\nAs of December 31, 2018, OG&E has a noncancellable operating lease with a purchase option, covering 1,093 rotary gondola railcars to transport coal from Wyoming to OG&E's coal-fired generation units. Rental payments are charged to fuel expense and are recovered through OG&E's tariffs and fuel adjustment clauses.\nEnable's business is impacted by commodity prices which have declined and otherwise experienced significant volatility in recent years. Commodity prices impact the drilling and production of natural gas and crude oil in the areas served by Enable's systems, and the volumes on Enable's systems are negatively impacted if producers decrease drilling and production in those areas served. Both Enable's gathering and processing segment and Enable's transportation and storage segment can be impacted by drilling and production. Enable's gathering and processing segment primarily serve producers, and many producers utilize the services provided by Enable's transportation and storage segment. A decrease in volumes will decrease the cash flows from Enable's systems. A portion of our earnings and operating cash flows depend on the performance of, and distributions from, Enable. As disclosed in this Form 10-K, Enable is subject to a number of risks, including contract renewal risk, the reliance on the drilling and production decisions of others and the volatility of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil prices. If any of those risks were to occur, the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOperating Activities\n\nCustomer balances are generally written off if not collected within six months after the final billing date. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for OG&E is calculated by multiplying the last six months of electric revenue by the provision rate, which is based on a 12-month historical average of actual balances written off. To the extent the historical collection rates are not representative of future collections, there could be an effect on the amount of uncollectible expense recognized. Also, a portion of the uncollectible provision related to fuel within the Oklahoma jurisdiction is being recovered through the fuel adjustment clause. At December 31, 2018, if the provision rate were to increase or decrease by 10 percent, this would cause a change in the uncollectible expense recognized of $0.2 million. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is a reduction to Accounts Receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is included in the Other Operation and Maintenance Expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $1.7 million and $1.5 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n \u2022 A decrease in net income at OGE Holdings of $216.4 million, or $1.08 per diluted share of the Company's common stock, was primarily due to lower income tax benefit due to an adjustment in 2017 resulting from the 2017 Tax Act, partially offset by higher equity in earnings of Enable due to increased revenues from Enable's gathering and processing business driven by higher processed volumes and higher natural gas gathering fees and gathered volumes. \n\nThe Company's consolidated estimates of capital expenditures for the years 2019 through 2023 are shown in the following table. These capital expenditures represent the base maintenance capital expenditures (i.e., capital expenditures to maintain and operate the Company's businesses) plus capital expenditures for known and committed projects. Estimated capital expenditures for Enable are not included in the table below.\nOGE Holdings' earnings before taxes increased $35.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period of 2016, primarily due to an increase in equity in earnings of Enable of $29.4 million and a decrease in pension settlement expense of $6.8 million. The following table presents summarized information regarding Enable's income statement changes for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, and the corresponding impact those changes had on the Company's equity in earnings of Enable.\n\nClimate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emissions\nThe EPA is required to set NAAQS for certain pollutants considered to be harmful to public health or the environment. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to review each NAAQS every five years. As a result of these reviews, the EPA periodically has taken action to adopt more stringent NAAQS for those pollutants. If any areas of Oklahoma were to be designated as not attaining the NAAQS for a particular pollutant, the Company could be required to install additional emission controls on its facilities to help the state achieve attainment with the NAAQS. As of December 31, 2018, no areas of Oklahoma had been designated as non-attainment for pollutants that are likely to affect the Company's operations. Several processes are under way to designate areas in Oklahoma as attaining or not attaining revised NAAQS.\nAir\nThe Company is a holding company with investments in energy and energy services providers offering physical delivery and related services for both electricity and natural gas primarily in the south central U.S. The Company conducts these activities through two business segments: (i) electric utility and (ii) natural gas midstream operations. The accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. The Company generally uses the equity method of accounting for investments where its ownership interest is between 20 percent and 50 percent and it lacks the power to direct activities that most significantly impact economic performance.\nFinancing Activities\nThe Company projects the earnings contribution from its ownership interest in Enable for 2019 to be approximately $104 million to $117 million, or $0.52 to $0.58 per average diluted share, and receive approximately $140 million in cash distributions.\n\nTotal capital requirements, consisting of capital expenditures and maturities of long-term debt, were $823.7 million, and contractual obligations, net of recoveries through fuel adjustment clauses, were $76.4 million, resulting in total net capital requirements and contractual obligations of $900.1 million in 2018, of which $139.8 million was to comply with environmental regulations. This compares to net capital requirements of $1,049.2 million and net contractual obligations of $78.8 million totaling $1,128.0 million in 2017, of which $213.9 million was to comply with environmental regulations.\nAllowance for equity funds used during construction increased $25.5 million, primarily due to higher construction work in progress balances resulting from increased spending for environmental projects.\nOn September 7, 2016, the EPA finalized an update to the 2011 CSAPR. The new rule applies to ozone-season NOX in 22 eastern states (including Oklahoma), utilizes a cap and trade program for NOX emissions and went into effect on May 1, 2017. The rule reduces the 2016 CSAPR emissions cap for all seven of OG&E's coal and gas facilities by 47 percent combined. OG&E and numerous other parties filed petitions for judicial and administrative review of the 2016 rule. Oral argument before the D.C. Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals was held on October 3, 2018.\nCapital Expenditures\nOn October 23, 2015, the EPA published the final Clean Power Plan that established standards of performance for CO2 emissions from existing fossil-fuel-fired power plants along with state-specific CO2 reduction standards expressed as both rate-based (lbs./MWh) and mass-based (tons/yr.) goals. However, the rule was challenged in court when it was issued, and the U.S. Supreme Court issued orders staying implementation of the Clean Power Plan on February 9, 2016 pending resolution of the court\nOG&E Railcar Lease Agreement\n (A) Increased primarily due to annual salary increases and an increase in incentive compensation. \nGross margin is defined by Enable as total revenues minus costs of natural gas and NGLs, excluding depreciation and amortization. Total revenues consist of the fees that Enable charges its customers and the sales price of natural gas and NGLs that Enable sells. The cost of natural gas and NGLs consists of the purchase price of natural gas and NGLs that Enable purchases. Enable deducts the cost of natural gas and NGLs from total revenues to arrive at a measure of the core profitability of their mix of fee-based and commodity-based customer arrangements. Gross margin allows for meaningful comparison of the operating results between Enable's fee-based revenues and Enable's commodity-based contracts which involve the purchase or sale of natural gas, NGLs and/or crude oil. In addition, the Company believes gross margin allows for a meaningful comparison of the results of Enable's commodity-based activities across different commodity price environments because it measures the spread between the product sales price and cost of products sold. Enable's definition of gross margin may be different from similar terms used by other companies. Further, gross margin is not intended to replace operating revenues as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance. For a reconciliation of gross margin to revenue, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented with GAAP, for the years ending December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, see \"OGE Holdings (Natural Gas Midstream Operations) Results of Operations\" below.\nAdditional capital expenditures beyond those identified in the table above, including additional incremental growth opportunities in electric transmission assets, will be evaluated based upon their impact upon achieving the Company's financial objectives.\nWaste\nEnable's gathering and processing business segment reported an increase in operating income of $137.0 million. The following table presents summarized information regarding Enable's gathering and processing business segment income statement changes for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, and the corresponding impact those changes had on the Company's equity in earnings of Enable.\nOGE Holdings' earnings before taxes increased $15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to an increase in equity in earnings of Enable of $21.6 million, partially offset by an increase in other expense and an increase in operation and maintenance expense. The following table presents summarized information regarding Enable's income statement changes for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, and the corresponding impact those changes had on the Company's equity in earnings of Enable.\n (C) Decrease in transmission-related charges was primarily due to lower SPP charges driven by lower rates charged to OG&E for transmission service as a result of lower tax rates due to the 2017 Tax Act. \nIncome tax expense decreased $101.8 million, or 71.8 percent, primarily due to a reduction in the corporate federal tax rate, an increase in the amortization of net unfunded deferred taxes, an increase in state tax credit generation and lower pre-tax income.\nEnvironmental regulation can increase the cost of planning, design, initial installation and operation of OG&E's facilities. Management continues to evaluate its compliance with existing and proposed environmental legislation and regulations and implement appropriate environmental programs in a competitive market.\n (B) Decreased primarily due to additional reserves for rate refunds in both Oklahoma and Arkansas, as well as riders moving to base rates in the March 2017 OCC rate order. \nEnable's Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n (A) Decrease in fuel expense during the year ended 2018 was primarily due to lower fuel prices and decreased utilization of company-owned generation. \nIncome tax expense was $37.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to income tax benefit of $195.2 million during the same period in 2017. The change is primarily due to the remeasurement of federal deferred taxes in 2017 as a result of the 2017 Tax Act.\nA security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Such rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the credit rating agency, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\ndecrease in firm transportation services between Carthage, Texas and Perryville, Louisiana and a decrease in realized gains on natural gas derivatives.\nIn March 2017, the Company and OG&E entered into unsecured five-year revolving credit agreements totaling $900.0 million ($450.0 million for the Company and $450.0 million for OG&E). Each of the facilities contained an option, which could be exercised up to two times, to extend the term of the respective facility for an additional year. Effective March 9, 2018, the Company and OG&E utilized one of those extensions to extend the maturity of their respective credit facility from March 8, 2022 to March 8, 2023.\nOG&E's operations generate wastes that are subject to the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 as well as comparable state laws which impose detailed requirements for the handling, storage, treatment and disposal of waste.\nEnvironmental Laws and Regulations\n \u2022 The increase in net income at OG&E of $21.4 million, or $0.11 per diluted share of the Company's common stock, was primarily due to higher net other income driven by increased allowance for equity funds used during construction as environmental and large capital projects were in progress during the year and lower depreciation and amortization expense as a result of the March 2017 OCC rate order mandating a reduction in depreciation rates. These increases were partially offset by higher income tax expense, higher operation and maintenance expense as a result of increased spending on vegetation management and lower gross margin primarily due to milder weather. \nOther income decreased $22.5 million, or 61.5 percent, primarily due to a decrease in the tax gross-up related to lower allowance for funds used during construction and a change in the presentation of guaranteed flat bill margins, which are now included in gross margin due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard (ASC 606).\nAccess to reasonably priced capital is dependent in part on credit and security ratings. Generally, lower ratings lead to higher financing costs. Pricing grids associated with the Company's credit facilities could cause annual fees and borrowing rates to increase if an adverse rating impact occurs. The impact of any future downgrade could include an increase in the costs of the Company's short-term borrowings, but a reduction in the Company's credit ratings would not result in any defaults or accelerations. Any future downgrade could also lead to higher long-term borrowing costs and, if below investment grade, would require the Company to post collateral or letters of credit.\n \u2022 normal weather patterns are experienced for the remainder of the year; \nAccrued Compensation. The balance of Accrued Compensation was $47.8 million and $35.9 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $11.9 million, or 33.1 percent, primarily due to higher accruals for incentive compensation, partially offset by a lower amount of accrued vacation.\nSee Note 2 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for discussion of current accounting pronouncements that are applicable to the Company.\nEnable's gathering and processing business segment reported an increase in operating income of $131.0 million. The following table presents summarized information regarding Enable's gathering and processing business segment income statement changes for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, and the corresponding impact those changes had on the Company's equity in earnings of Enable.\nincorporate higher capital spending plans and the effects of the 2017 Tax Act, and uncertainty regarding regulatory risk. The revised outlooks did not trigger any collateral requirements or change fees under the revolving credit agreements.\nThe increase in the Company's equity in earnings of Enable was primarily due to the following:\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nTransportation and storage gross margin increased primarily due to an increase in gross margin from changes in the fair value of natural gas derivatives, an increase in NGL sales due to an increase in transported volumes and NGL prices and an increase in off-system transportation margins. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in system management activities, a\n\nAccounts Payable. The balance of Accounts Payable was $239.3 million and $230.4 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $8.9 million, or 3.9 percent, primarily due to the timing of vendor payments.\nDue to the pending litigation and administrative proceedings, the ultimate timing and impact of the 2016 CSAPR update rule on our operations cannot be determined with certainty at this time. However, the Company does not anticipate additional capital expenditures beyond what has already been disclosed and does not expect that the reduced emissions cap, if upheld, will have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\ndegree of difference equaling one cooling degree day. If the calculated average is below 65 degrees, then the difference between the calculated average and 65 is expressed as heating degree days, with each degree of difference equaling one heating degree day. The daily calculations are then totaled for the particular reporting period.\n (B) Increase in the cost of purchases from the SPP was due to an increase of 26.8 percent in MWh purchased and an increase of 16.2 percent in cost per MWhs purchased. The increase in cost per MWh purchased was due to an increase in fuel prices and higher grid congestion costs during 2017. \nThe activities of the Company are subject to numerous stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection. These laws and regulations can change, restrict or otherwise impact the Company's business activities in many ways, including the handling or disposal of waste material, planning for future construction activities to avoid or mitigate harm to threatened or endangered species and requiring the installation and operation of emissions control equipment. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Management believes that all of its operations are in substantial compliance with current federal, state and local environmental standards.\n (C) Increase in transmission-related charges was primarily due to higher SPP charges for the base plan projects of other utilities. \n\nManagement expects that cash generated from operations, proceeds from the issuance of long- and short-term debt, proceeds from the sales of common stock to the public through the Company's Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan or other offerings and distributions from Enable will be adequate over the next three years to meet anticipated cash needs and to fund future growth opportunities. The Company utilizes short-term borrowings (through a combination of bank borrowings and commercial paper) to satisfy temporary working capital needs and as an interim source of financing capital expenditures until permanent financing is arranged.\nThe decrease in transportation and storage business segment operating income was primarily due to the following:\nDerivative instruments have been used at times in managing OG&E's commodity price exposure. The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, provides for regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission of certain commodity-related contracts. Although OG&E qualifies for an end-user exception from mandatory clearing of commodity-related swaps, these regulations could affect the ability of OG&E to participate in these markets and could add additional regulatory oversight over its contracting activities.\nFederal Clean Air Act Overview\nFurther discussion can be found in Note 15 within \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nOG&E (Electric Utility)\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 as compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates includes the Company's share of Enable earnings adjusted for the amortization of the basis difference of the Company's investment in Enogex LLC and its underlying equity in the net assets of Enable and is also adjusted for the elimination of the Enogex Holdings fair value adjustments.\n (A) Increased during 2017 primarily due to more storm costs exceeding the $2.7 million OCC-allowed threshold, which were moved to a regulatory asset, as well as mutual assistance, which was provided in the aftermath of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. \n \u2022 a decrease in revenues from natural gas sales less the cost of natural gas primarily due to a decrease due to lower average prices partially offset by higher sales volumes and an increase in fuel costs; and \nin depreciation rates, higher allowance for equity funds used during construction, higher other income and higher allowance for borrowed funds used during construction, partially offset by higher income tax expense, higher operation and maintenance expense, lower gross margin and higher interest on long-term debt.\nThe railcar lease was recorded on the Company's 2019 Balance Sheet upon adoption of the new leases standard (ASC 842).\nSite Remediation\nThe following table indicates the sensitivity of the Pension Plan funded status to these variables.\n2017 compared to 2016. OG&E's net income increased $21.4 million, or 7.5 percent, in 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily due to lower depreciation and amortization expense as a result of the March 2017 OCC rate order mandating a reduction\n (B) Increase in the cost of purchases from the SPP for the year ended 2018 was due to a 21.1 percent increase in MWhs purchased, partially offset by a 9.0 percent decrease in cost per MWhs purchased due to a decrease in fuel prices. \n\nAdditionally, the Company wants to achieve a premium valuation of its businesses relative to its peers, grow earnings per share with a stable earnings pattern, create a high performance culture and achieve desired outcomes with target stakeholders. The Company's financial objectives include a long-term annual earnings growth rate for OG&E of four to six percent on a weather-normalized basis, maintaining a strong credit rating as well as targeting dividend increases of approximately 10 percent annually through 2019. The Company also utilizes cash distributions from its investment in Enable to help fund its capital needs and support future dividend growth. The Company believes it can accomplish these financial objectives by, among other things, pursuing multiple avenues to build its business, maintaining a diversified asset position, continuing to develop a wide range of skills to succeed with changes in its industries, providing products and services to customers efficiently, managing risks effectively and having strong regulatory and legislative relationships.\nHazardous Air Pollutants Emission Standards\nOG&E has the necessary regulatory approvals to incur up to $800.0 million in short-term borrowings at any one time for a two-year period beginning January 1, 2019 and ending December 31, 2020. See Note 11 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for further discussion of the Company's short-term debt activity.\nThe Company projects OG&E to earn approximately $311 million to $325 million, or $1.55 to $1.62 per average diluted share, in 2019 and is based on the following assumptions:\n \u2022 an increase in revenues from NGLs sales less the cost of NGLs, partially offset by higher average NGLs prices and higher processed volumes in the Anadarko and Ark-La-Tex Basins; and \nReconciliation of Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates\nOG&E is focused on:\n \u2022 An increase in net income at OG&E of $22.5 million, or $0.11 per diluted share of the Company's common stock, was primarily due to higher gross margin due to favorable weather (reduced by lower customer rates which were offset by lower income tax expense). This increase was partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense, primarily due to a reduction in depreciation expense recorded in March 2017 for the period from July 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016 resulting from the March 2017 OCC rate order, and higher interest expense driven by increased debt outstanding during 2018 and decreased allowance for borrowed funds used during construction as environmental and large capital projects have been completed. \n \u2022 continuing focus on operational excellence and efficiencies in order to protect the customer bill. \nThe application of income tax law is complex. Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and often ambiguous. Interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time. Accordingly, it is necessary to make judgments regarding income tax exposure. As a result, changes in these judgments can materially affect amounts the Company recognized in its consolidated financial statements. Tax positions taken by the Company on its income tax returns that are recognized in the financial statements must satisfy a more likely than not recognition threshold, assuming that the position will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information. See Note 8 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for discussion of the effects of the 2017 Tax Act and other tax policies.\nchallenges. The EPA published a proposal on October 16, 2017 to repeal the Clean Power Plan. On August 31, 2018, without acting on the proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan, the EPA published the Affordable Clean Energy Rule, a proposed rule to replace the Clean Power Plan. The ultimate timing and impact of these standards on OG&E's operations cannot be determined with certainty at this time, although a requirement for significant reduction of CO2 emissions from existing fossil-fuel-fired power plants ultimately could result in significant additional compliance costs that would affect the Company's future consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.\nDetailed below is a reconciliation of gross margin to revenue included in the 2019 Outlook.\n\nSummary of Operating Results\nOG&E's cost of sales increased $17.5 million, or 2.0 percent, in 2017 as compared to 2016. The below factors contributed to the change in cost of sales.\n \u2022 a decrease due to intercompany management fees. \nThe increase in Enable's gathering and processing business segment operating income was primarily due to the following:\nWater\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is confronted with issues or events that may result in a contingent liability. These generally relate to lawsuits or claims made by third parties, including governmental agencies. When appropriate, management consults with legal counsel and other experts to assess the claim. If, in management's opinion, the Company has incurred a probable loss as set forth by GAAP, an estimate is made of the loss, and the appropriate accounting entries are reflected in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. At the present time, based on available information, the Company believes that any reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued amounts arising out of pending or threatened lawsuits or claims would not be quantitatively material to its financial statements and would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Notes 14 and 15 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings\" for a discussion of the Company's commitments and contingencies.\nOn May 22, 2015, the EPA issued a final rule to address the provisions in the SIPs of 36 states (including Oklahoma) regarding the treatment of emissions that occur during startup, shutdown and malfunction operations. The final rule clarifies the EPA's Startup, Shutdown and Malfunction Policy. Although judicial challenges to the rule are ongoing, the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality submitted a SIP revision for the EPA's approval on November 7, 2016 to comply with this rule. This rule has resulted in permit modifications for certain OG&E units. The Company does not anticipate capital expenditures or a material impact to its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, as a result of adoption of this rule.\n (A) Decrease in fuel expense was primarily due to decreased utilization of company-owned generation. \nAt December 31, 2018, 32.4 percent of the Pension Plan investments were in listed common stocks with the balance primarily invested in corporate fixed income, other securities and U.S. Treasury notes and bonds as presented in Note 12 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" During 2018, actual losses on the Pension Plan were $39.2 million, compared to expected return on plan assets of $44.1 million. During the same time, corporate bond yields, which are used in determining the discount rate for future pension obligations, decreased. Funding levels are dependent on returns on plan assets and future discount rates. The Company made a $15.0 million and $20.0 million contribution to its Pension Plan in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company has not determined whether it will need to make any contributions to the Pension Plan in 2019. The Company could be required to make additional contributions if the value of its pension trust and postretirement benefit plan trust assets are adversely impacted by a major market disruption in the future.\nThe increase of $346.7 million in net cash used in financing activities in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to the issuance of less long-term debt by OG&E in 2018, a decrease in short-term debt and additional long-term debt paid off in 2018.\nCash Flows\nFinancing Activities and Future Sources of Financing\n (A) Represent capital costs associated with OG&E's ECP to comply with the EPA's Regional Haze Rule. More detailed discussion regarding the Regional Haze Rule and OG&E's ECP can be found in Notes 14 and 15 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and in \"Environmental Laws and Regulations\" below. \nThe increase of $166.6 million, or 21.2 percent, in net cash provided from operating activities in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in vendor payments and an increase in amounts received from customers at OG&E.\nPursuant to the Enable Limited Partnership Agreement, Enable made distributions of $141.2 million, $141.2 million and $141.2 million to the Company during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As required by Enable's Limited Partnership Agreement and General Partner Agreement, respectively, the last permitted distribution date is 60 days after the close of each quarter, and the distribution deadline is five days following distributions by Enable.\nSecurity Ratings\nAs of December 31, 2018, OG&E has 440 MWs of QF contracts with AES and Oklahoma Cogeneration LLC to meet its current and future expected customer needs. The QF contract with AES expired on January 15, 2019, and the QF contract with Oklahoma Cogeneration LLC expires on August 31, 2019. On December 20, 2018, OG&E announced its plan to acquire power plants from AES and Oklahoma Cogeneration LLC, pending regulatory approval, to meet customers' energy needs. Further discussion can be found in Notes 14 and 15 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nIncome tax benefit was $195.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to income tax expense of $40.5 million during the same period in 2016. The change is primarily due to a remeasurement of federal deferred taxes related to the 2017 Tax Act, a remeasurement of state deferred taxes and return to provision adjustments related to the Company's investment in Enable during the year ended December 31, 2016, offset by higher pre-tax operating income.\nOG&E participates in the SPP Integrated Marketplace. As part of the Integrated Marketplace, the SPP has balancing authority responsibilities for its market participants. The SPP Integrated Marketplace functions as a centralized dispatch, where market participants, including OG&E, submit offers to sell power to the SPP from their resources and bid to purchase power from the SPP for their customers. The SPP Integrated Marketplace is intended to allow the SPP to optimize supply offers and demand bids based upon reliability and economic considerations and to determine which generating units will run at any given time for maximum cost-effectiveness within the SPP area. As a result, OG&E's generating units produce output that is different from OG&E's customer load requirements. Net fuel and purchased power costs are recovered through fuel adjustment clauses.\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nOn July 11, 2018, Moody's Investors Service lowered its rating from A3 to Baa1 for the Company and from A1 to A2 for OG&E with both companies having negative outlooks. The Oklahoma regulatory environment and the 2017 Tax Act were both cited by Moody's Investors Service as contributing factors to the credit downgrade. Moody's Investors Service indicated that the negative outlook for OG&E is a reflection of current capital expenditures relating to environmental projects, upcoming debt maturities over the next year and decreased cash flow as a result of the 2017 Tax Act. In addition to the OG&E impacts, Moody's Investors Service indicated that the negative outlook for the Company is a reflection of Enable's business risk, due to the volatility of the oil and gas industry, which Moody's Investors Service indicated could lead to decreased distributions.\n \u2022 an increase in other firm transportation and storage services due to new interstate and intrastate transportation contracts; \nFor Oklahoma jurisdictional revenues, OG&E reserved the excess income taxes collected in current rates, plus interest, from January 2018 through June 2018, and any amortization of excess accumulated deferred income taxes associated with the 2017 Tax Act, which was refunded to Oklahoma customers, as approved by the OCC, during the July 2018 billing cycle. For Arkansas jurisdictional revenues, OG&E reserved the excess income taxes collected in current rates, plus carrying charges, from January 2018 through September 2018, as the Tax Adjustment Rider became effective on October 1, 2018. For FERC jurisdictional revenues, based on an order received from the FERC, OG&E reserved the excess income taxes collected in current rates from January 2018 through June 2018, as the new tax rate was reflected in billings beginning with the July 2018 invoice. Further, for Arkansas and FERC jurisdictional revenues, OG&E is also reserving any amortization of excess accumulated deferred income taxes associated with the 2017 Tax Act.\nOG&E's operations are subject to the Federal Clean Water Act and comparable state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations impose detailed requirements and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state and federal waters.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 as compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nUnbilled Revenues\nregulatory assets and liabilities and unbilled revenues. The selection, application and disclosure of the following critical accounting estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. The Company discusses its significant accounting policies, including those that do not require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates, in Note 1 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nThe following discussion and analysis presents factors that affected the Company's consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 and the Company's consolidated financial position at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The following information should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. Known trends and contingencies of a material nature are discussed to the extent considered relevant.\nRecent Developments and Regulatory Matters\nAccounts Receivable and Accrued Unbilled Revenues. The balance of Accounts Receivable and Accrued Unbilled Revenues was $237.3 million and $257.1 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $19.8 million, or 7.7 percent, primarily due to a decrease in billings to OG&E's retail customers.\n \u2022 an increase in volume-dependent transportation primarily due to an increase in commodity fees from new contracts and an increase in off-system transportation due to increases in volumes at higher rates; and \nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nAir Quality Control System\n* Greater than a 100 percent variance.\nEndangered Species\nOG&E has significant seasonality in its earnings. OG&E typically shows the majority of its earnings in the second and third quarters due to the seasonal nature of air conditioning demand.\nOn March 5, 2018, S&P's Global Ratings revised the rating outlooks on the Company and OG&E from stable to negative. S&P's Global Ratings indicated that the revised outlooks reflect the limited cushion in company financial measures, which\n \u2022 having strong regulatory and legislative relationships for the long-term benefit of our customers, investors and members; \n\n\n\n \u2022 an effective tax rate of approximately 9.9 percent; and \nWorking Capital\nIncome tax expense increased $27.4 million, or 24.0 percent, primarily due to higher pre-tax operating income and lower tax credits generated.\nIn December 2018, OG&E filed a general rate review with the OCC, requesting a rate increase to recover its investments in the Dry Scrubbers project and in the conversion of Muskogee Units 4 and 5 to natural gas to comply with the Regional Haze Rule. The filing also seeks to align OG&E's return on equity more closely to the industry average and to align OG&E's depreciation rates to more realistically reflect its assets' lifespans.\n \u2022 gross margin on revenues of approximately $1.416 billion to $1.421 billion based on sales growth of approximately one percent on a weather-adjusted basis; \n\nOther operation and maintenance expense increased $18.6 million, or 4.1 percent, in 2017 as compared to 2016. The below factors contributed to the change in other operation and maintenance expense.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nThe Company has sought and will continue to seek pollution prevention opportunities and to evaluate the effectiveness of its waste reduction, reuse and recycling efforts. In 2018, the Company obtained refunds of $1.9 million from the recycling of scrap metal, salvaged transformers and used transformer oil. This figure does not include the additional savings gained through the reduction and/or avoidance of disposal costs and the reduction in material purchases due to the reuse of existing materials. Similar savings are anticipated in future years.\nThe decrease of $245.9 million, or 29.9 percent, in net cash used in investing activities in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures primarily related to environmental and large capital projects at OG&E.\n (A) Includes an income tax benefit of $245.2 million in 2017 due to the remeasurement of deferred taxes, as a result of the 2017 Tax Act. \nIn August 2018, OG&E issued $400.0 million of 3.80 percent senior notes due August 15, 2028. The proceeds from the issuance were added to OG&E's general funds to be used for general corporate purposes, including to fund the payment of OG&E's $250.0 million of 6.35 percent senior notes that matured on September 1, 2018, to repay short-term debt and to fund ongoing capital expenditures and working capital.\nTo satisfy the FIP, OG&E installed Dry Scrubbers at Sooner Units 1 and 2 and is converting Muskogee Units 4 and 5 to natural gas. As of December 31, 2018, OG&E has invested $504.3 million in the Dry Scrubbers and $50.5 million in the Muskogee natural gas conversion.\nThe actual cost of fuel used in electric generation (which includes the operating lease obligations for OG&E's railcar leases shown above) and certain purchased power costs are passed on to OG&E's customers through fuel adjustment clauses. Accordingly, while the cost of fuel related to operating leases and the vast majority of minimum fuel purchase commitments of OG&E noted above may increase capital requirements, such costs are recoverable through fuel adjustment clauses and have little, if any, impact on net capital requirements and future contractual obligations. The fuel adjustment clauses are subject to periodic review by the OCC and the APSC.\nOther net periodic benefit expense decreased $7.4 million, or 45.4 percent, primarily due to amortization of unrecognized prior service cost.\n2018 compared to 2017. OG&E's net income increased $22.5 million, or 7.4 percent, in 2018 as compared to 2017, primarily due to higher gross margin (reduced by lower customer rates which were offset by lower income tax expense), partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense, primarily due to a reduction in depreciation expense recorded in March 2017 for the period from July 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016 resulting from the March 2017 OCC rate order, lower other income and higher interest expense.\nThe increase of $150.7 million in net cash provided from financing activities in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to the issuance by OG&E of $300.0 million in long-term debt in each of March 2017 and August 2017, partially offset by a decrease in short-term debt and the payment of $100.0 million in long-term debt in November 2017.\n \u2022 interest expense of approximately $143 million to $145 million which assumes a $1.4 million allowance for borrowed funds used during construction reduction to interest expense and assumes a debt issuance of $300 million in the second half of 2019; \nShort-term borrowings generally are used to meet working capital requirements. The Company borrows on a short-term basis, as necessary, by the issuance of commercial paper and by borrowings under its revolving credit agreement. The Company has revolving credit facilities totaling $900.0 million. These bank facilities can also be used as letter of credit facilities. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had no short-term debt outstanding compared to $168.4 million at December 31, 2017. The following tables highlight the Company's short-term debt activity as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nShort-Term Debt and Credit Facilities\nKey assumptions for 2019 include:\nGathering and processing gross margin increased primarily due to the following:\nOG&E recognizes revenue from electric sales when power is delivered to customers. OG&E reads its customers' meters and sends bills to its customers throughout each month. As a result, there is a significant amount of customers' electricity consumption that has not been billed at the end of each month. OG&E accrues an estimate of the revenues for electric sales delivered since the latest billings. Unbilled revenue is presented in Accrued Unbilled Revenues on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and in Operating Revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income based on estimates of usage and prices during the period. At December 31, 2018, if the estimated usage or price used in the unbilled revenue calculation were to increase or decrease by one percent, this would cause a change in the unbilled revenues recognized of $0.4 million. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, Accrued Unbilled Revenues were $62.6 million and $66.5 million, respectively. The estimates that management uses in this calculation could vary from the actual amounts to be paid by customers.\nOGE Holdings\n \u2022 a decrease in changes in the fair value of natural gas derivatives; and \nResults of Operations\nThe EPA's 2005 Regional Haze Rule is intended to protect visibility in certain national parks and wilderness areas throughout the U.S. that may be impacted by air pollutant emissions. On December 28, 2011, the EPA issued a final Regional Haze Rule for Oklahoma which adopted a FIP for SO2 emissions at Sooner Units 1 and 2 and Muskogee Units 4 and 5. The FIP compliance date was January 4, 2019 as a result of an appeal filed by OG&E and others.\n\nTransportation and storage gross margin decreased primarily due to the following:\nGross margin decreased $15.6 million, or 1.1 percent, in 2017 as compared to 2016. The below factors contributed to the change in gross margin.\n (C) Further discussion of OG&E's reserve for tax refund in response to OCC, APSC and FERC proceedings can be found in Notes 8 and 15 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" \nThe Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contain information that is pertinent to Management's Discussion and Analysis. In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Changes to these assumptions and estimates could have a material effect on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. However, the Company believes it has taken reasonable positions where assumptions and estimates are used in order to minimize the negative financial impact to the Company that could result if actual results vary from the assumptions and estimates. In management's opinion, the areas of the Company where the most significant judgment is exercised includes the determination of Pension Plan assumptions, income taxes, contingency reserves, asset retirement obligations and depreciable lives of property, plant and equipment. For the electric utility segment, significant judgment is also exercised in the determination of\nOn September 30, 2015, the EPA finalized a NAAQS for ozone at 70 ppb, which is more stringent than the previous standard of 75 ppb set in 2008. In September 2016, Oklahoma submitted to the EPA the recommendation of \"attainment/unclassifiable\" for all 77 counties in Oklahoma. On June 4, 2018, the EPA published its final determination that there are no nonattainment areas in Oklahoma. Based on this assessment, no material impacts are anticipated at this time.\n (B) Changes are primarily due to the timing of normal plant maintenance. \nOn February 16, 2012, the EPA published the final MATS rule regulating the emissions of certain hazardous air pollutants from electric generating units, which became effective April 16, 2012. The Company complied with the MATS rule by the April\n \u2022 an increase in natural gas gathering fees due to higher fees and gathered volumes in the Anadarko and Ark-La-Tex Basins; \nAccounting Pronouncements\nFuture Capital Requirements\nThere is continuing discussion and evaluation of possible global climate change in certain regulatory and legislative arenas. The focus is generally on emissions of greenhouse gases, including CO2, sulfur hexafluoride and methane, and whether these emissions are contributing to the warming of the earth's atmosphere. On June 1, 2017, President Trump announced that the U.S. will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord and begin negotiations to re-enter the agreement with different terms. A new agreement may result in future additional emissions reductions in the U.S.; however, it is not possible to determine what the international legal standards for greenhouse gas emissions will be in the future and the extent to which these commitments will be implemented through the Clean Air Act or any other existing statutes and new legislation.\nOn August 1, 2018, Fitch Ratings lowered its senior unsecured debt rating from A- to BBB+ for the Company and from A+ to A for OG&E with both companies having stable outlooks. Fitch Ratings cited the regulatory environment in Oklahoma, underscored by the unfavorable rate review outcomes in 2017 and 2018 and uncertainty surrounding regulatory treatment for OG&E's investment in the Dry Scrubbers at Sooner Units 1 and 2, as a key contributing factor to the credit downgrade. Fitch Ratings also indicated that the Company's credit profile reflects Enable's higher operating risks.\nGathering and processing gross margin increased primarily due to an increase in gross margin from natural gas sales due to higher average natural gas prices and higher gathering volumes in the Anadarko and Ark-La-Tex Basins, an increase in processing margins resulting from higher average NGL prices and higher processed volumes in the Anadarko Basin, an increase in gathering margin due to increased gathering volumes in the Anadarko and Ark-La-Tex Basins and increased billings under minimum volume commitments in the Arkoma Basin and an increase in gross margin from changes in the fair value of condensate and NGL derivatives.\nIt is estimated that OG&E's total expenditures to comply with environmental laws, regulations and requirements for 2019 will be $50.0 million, of which $25.5 million is for capital expenditures. The amounts for OG&E include capital expenditures for the Dry Scrubbers at Sooner Units 1 and 2 and the conversion of Muskogee Units 4 and 5 to natural gas. It is estimated that OG&E's total expenditures to comply with environmental laws, regulations and requirements for 2020 will be $22.6 million, of which $0.2 million is for capital expenditures.\nOverview\nAllowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable\nThe following table reconciles OGE Energy's equity in earnings of its unconsolidated affiliates for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nShort-Term Debt. There was no balance of Short-term Debt at December 31, 2018 compared to a balance of $168.4 million at December 31, 2017, respectively, a decrease of $168.4 million. The Company borrows on a short-term basis, as necessary, by the issuance of commercial paper and by borrowings under its revolving credit agreements. The decrease was primarily due to the proceeds of the senior notes issuance in August 2018 being utilized for general corporate purposes instead of borrowing under the Company's revolving credit agreement.\nCommon Stock Dividends\nRegional Haze Control Measures\nIn 2018, the Company's primary sources of capital were cash generated from operations, proceeds from the issuance of long- and short-term debt and distributions from Enable. Changes in working capital reflect the seasonal nature of the Company's business, the revenue lag between billing and collection from customers and fuel inventories. See \"Working Capital\" for a discussion of significant changes in net working capital requirements as it pertains to operating cash flow and liquidity.\nAs a result of the 2017 Tax Act, in early January 2018: (i) the OCC ordered OG&E to record a reserve, including accrued interest, to reflect the reduced federal corporate tax rate, among other tax implications, on an interim basis, subject to refund until utility rates were adjusted to reflect the federal tax savings; (ii) the APSC ordered OG&E to book regulatory liabilities to record the current and deferred impacts of the 2017 Tax Act until the resulting benefits, including carrying charges, are returned to customers; and (iii) through a Section 206 filing with the FERC, modifications were requested to be made to OG&E's transmission formula rates to reflect the impacts of the 2017 Tax Act.\nIncome Taxes\nOn February 8, 2019, Enable announced a quarterly dividend distribution of $0.31800 per unit on its outstanding common units, which is unchanged from the previous quarter. If cash distributions to Enable's unitholders exceed $0.330625 per unit in any quarter, the general partner will receive increasing percentages, up to 50 percent, of the cash Enable distributes in excess of that amount. The Company is entitled to 60 percent of those \"incentive distributions.\"\nWorking capital is defined as the difference in current assets and current liabilities. The Company's working capital requirements are driven generally by changes in accounts receivable, accounts payable, commodity prices, credit extended to and the timing of collections from customers, the level and timing of spending for maintenance and expansion activity, inventory levels and fuel recoveries.\nAllowance for equity funds used during construction decreased $15.9 million, or 40.1 percent, primarily due to lower construction work in progress balances resulting from certain environmental projects being completed and placed into service.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $35.5 million, or 11.2 percent, primarily due to lower depreciation expense related to the reduction in depreciation rates approved in the March 2017 OCC rate order, partially offset by additional assets being placed into service.\n \u2022 an increase in processing service fees resulting from higher processed volumes primarily under fixed processing arrangements in the Anadarko and Ark-La-Tex Basins; \nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n \u2022 providing safe, reliable energy to the communities and customers we serve, with a particular focus on enhancing the value of the grid by improving distribution grid reliability by reducing the frequency and duration of customer interruptions and leveraging previous grid technology investments; \nThe natural gas midstream operations segment represents the Company's investment in Enable through wholly owned subsidiaries and ultimately OGE Holdings. Enable was formed in 2013, and its general partner is equally controlled by the Company and CenterPoint, who each have 50 percent management ownership. Based on the 50/50 management ownership, with neither company having control, the Company accounts for its interest in Enable using the equity method of accounting. Enable is primarily engaged in the business of gathering, processing, transporting and storing natural gas. Enable's natural gas gathering and processing assets are strategically located in four states and serve natural gas production from shale developments in the Anadarko, Arkoma and Ark-La-Tex Basins. Enable also owns a crude oil gathering business in the Anadarko and Williston Basins. Enable has intrastate natural gas transportation and storage assets that are located in Oklahoma as well as interstate assets that extend from western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle to Louisiana, from Louisiana to Illinois and from Louisiana to Alabama. At December 31, 2018, the Company owned 111.0 million common units, or 25.6 percent, of Enable's outstanding units. For additional information on the Company's equity investment in Enable and related party transactions, see Note 4 in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\n \u2022 The increase in net income at OGE Holdings of $271.5 million, or $1.36 per diluted share of the Company's common stock, was primarily due to an income tax benefit of $245.2 million as a result of the 2017 Tax Act and an increase of equity in earnings of Enable due to increased revenues from Enable's gathering and processing business driven by higher average natural gas prices and higher gathering volumes as well as higher average NGLs prices and higher processed volumes.

midstream operations. \n\n- Net income was $425.5 million in 2018, down from $619 million in 2017 primarily due to lower income tax benefits in 2018. \n\n- The electric utility segment (OG&E) saw a $22.5 million increase in net income in 2018 compared to 2017, driven by higher gross margin and lower income tax expense offset by higher depreciation expense.\n\n- The natural gas midstream segment saw a $216.4 million decrease in net income in 2018 compared to 2017, due to lower income tax benefits in 2018 compared to a large tax benefit in 2017 from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. \n\n- Capital expenditures were $576 million in 2018, down from $822 million in 2017, primarily due to lower spending on environmental projects. \n\n- The company projects earnings of $412-442 million in 2019. Key assumptions include OG&E earning $311-325 million and the natural gas segment earning $104-117 million.\n\n- The company plans to continue pursuing growth opportunities in both the electric utility and midstream businesses while maintaining a diversified asset position. Key financial objectives include 4-6% long-term earnings growth for OG&E and 10% annual dividend growth.\n\nIn summary, net income decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to one-time tax benefits in 2017, but the company expects continued earnings and dividend growth in 2019 and beyond by pursuing growth opportunities in its core electric utility and midstream businesses."}
