The following discussion contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties (see discussion of Forward-Looking Statements\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those factors set forth under Item 1A - Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBackground\nAs one of the largest integrated equipment services companies in the United States focused on heavy construction and industrial equipment, we rent, sell and provide parts and services support for four core categories of specialized equipment: (1) hi-lift or aerial work platform equipment; (2) cranes; (3) earthmoving equipment; and (4) industrial lift trucks. By providing equipment rental, sales, on-site parts, repair and maintenance functions under one roof, we are a one-stop provider for our customers' varied equipment needs. This full service approach provides us with multiple points of customer contact, enables us to maintain a high quality rental fleet, as well as an effective distribution channel for fleet disposal and provides cross-selling opportunities among our new and used equipment sales, rental, parts sales and services operations.\nAs of February 14, 2019, we operated 96 full-service facilities throughout the Intermountain, Southwest, Gulf Coast, West Coast, Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. Our work force includes distinct, focused sales forces for our new and used equipment sales and rental operations, highly skilled service technicians, product specialists and regional managers. We focus our sales and rental activities on, and organize our personnel principally by, our four core equipment categories. We believe this allows us to provide specialized equipment knowledge, improve the effectiveness of our rental and sales force and strengthen our customer relationships. In addition, we have branch managers for each location who are responsible for managing their assets and financial results. We believe this fosters accountability in our business and strengthens our local and regional relationships.\nThrough our predecessor companies, we have been in the equipment services business for approximately 58 years. H&E Equipment Services L.L.C. ( H&E LLC\u201d) was formed in June 2002 through the business combination of Head & Engquist Equipment, LLC ( Head & Engquist\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gulf Wide Industries, L.L.C. ( Gulf Wide\u201d), and ICM Equipment Company L.L.C. ( ICM\u201d). Head & Engquist, founded in 1961, and ICM, founded in 1971, were two leading regional, integrated equipment service companies operating in contiguous geographic markets. In the June 2002 transaction, Head & Engquist and ICM were merged with and into Gulf Wide, which was renamed H&E LLC. Prior to the combination, Head & Engquist operated 25 facilities in the Gulf Coast region, and ICM operated 16 facilities in the Intermountain region of the United States.\nPrior to our initial public offering in February 2006, our business was conducted through H&E LLC. In connection with our initial public offering, we converted H&E LLC into H&E Equipment Services, Inc. In order to have an operating Delaware corporation as the issuer for our initial public offering, H&E Equipment Services, Inc. was formed as a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of H&E Holdings L.L.C. ( H&E Holdings\u201d), and immediately prior to the closing of our initial public offering, on February 3, 2006, H&E LLC and H&E Holdings merged with and into H&E Equipment Services, Inc., which survived the reincorporation merger as the operating company. Effective February 3, 2006, H&E LLC and H&E Holdings no longer existed under operation of law pursuant to the reincorporation merger.\nEffective January 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Contractors Equipment Center, a privately-held company focused on non-residential construction equipment rentals serving the greater Denver, Colorado area out of three branch locations. Effective April 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Rental, Inc., a privately-held equipment rental and distribution company with five branch locations in Alabama and Florida. Effective February 1, 2019, we completed the acquisition of We-Rent-It, a privately-held equipment rental company with six branch locations in Central Texas.\nBusiness Segments\nWe have five reportable segments because we derive our revenues from five principal business activities: (1) equipment rentals; (2) new equipment sales; (3) used equipment sales; (4) parts sales; and (5) repair and maintenance services. These segments are based upon how we allocate resources and assess performance. In addition, we also have non-segmented revenues and costs that relate to equipment support activities.\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Equipment Rentals. Our rental operation primarily rents our four core types of construction and industrial equipment. We have a well-maintained rental fleet and our own dedicated sales force, focused by equipment type. We actively manage the size, quality, age and composition of our rental fleet based on our analysis of key measures such as time utilization (which we analyze as equipment usage based on: (1) a percentage of original equipment cost, and (2) the number of rental equipment units available for rent), rental rate trends and targets, rental equipment dollar utilization and maintenance and repair costs, which we closely monitor. We maintain fleet quality through regional quality control managers and our parts and services operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> New Equipment Sales.

Our used equipment sales are an effective way for us to manage the size and composition of our rental fleet and provide a profitable distribution channel for disposal of rental equipment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Parts Sales. Our parts business sells new and used parts for the equipment we sell and also provides parts to our own rental fleet.

In order to provide timely parts and services support to our customers as well as our own rental fleet, we maintain an extensive parts inventory.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Services. Our services operation provides maintenance and repair services for our customers' equipment and to our own rental fleet at our facilities as well as at our customers' locations. As the authorized distributor for numerous equipment manufacturers, we are able to provide service to that equipment that will be covered under the manufacturer's warranty.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur non-segmented revenues and costs for the periods presented in the Annual Report on Form 10-K relate to equipment support activities that we provide, such as transportation, hauling, parts freight and damage waivers, and are not generally allocated to reportable segments.\nYou can read more about our business segments in note 18 of the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Sources\nWe generate all of our total revenues from our five business segments and our non-segmented equipment support activities. Equipment rentals and new equipment sales account for more than half of our total revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 47.8% of our total revenues were attributable to equipment rentals, 21.3% of our total revenues were attributable to new equipment sales, 10.1% were attributable to used equipment sales, 9.7% were attributable to parts sales, 5.1% were attributable to our services revenues and 6.0% were attributable to non-segmented other revenues.\nThe pie charts below illustrate a breakdown of our revenues and gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 by business segment (see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our business segments):\nThe equipment that we sell, rent and service is principally used in the construction industry, as well as by companies for commercial and industrial uses such as plant maintenance and turnarounds, as well as in the petrochemical and energy sectors. As a result, our total revenues are affected by several factors including, but not limited to, the demand for and availability of rental equipment, rental rates and other competitive factors, the demand for new and used equipment, the level of construction and industrial activities, spending levels by our customers, adverse weather conditions and general economic conditions. For a discussion of the impact of seasonality on our revenues, see Seasonality\u201d below.\nEquipment Rentals. Our rental operation primarily rents our four core types of construction and industrial equipment. We have a well-maintained rental fleet and our own dedicated sales force, focused by equipment type. We actively manage the size, quality, age and composition of our rental fleet based on our analysis of key measures such as time utilization (which we analyze as equipment usage based on: (1) a percentage of original equipment cost, and (2) the number of rental equipment units available for rent), rental rate trends and targets, rental equipment dollar utilization and maintenance and repair costs, which we closely monitor. We maintain fleet quality through regional quality control managers and our parts and services operations.\nNew Equipment Sales. We seek to optimize revenues from new equipment sales by selling equipment through a professional in-house retail sales force focused by product type. While sales of new equipment are impacted by the availability of equipment from the manufacturer, we believe our status as a leading distributor for some of our key suppliers improves our ability to obtain equipment. New equipment sales are an important component of our integrated model due to customer interaction and service contact and new equipment sales also lead to future parts and services revenues.\nUsed Equipment Sales. We generate the majority of our used equipment sales revenues by selling equipment from our rental fleet. The remainder of our used equipment sales revenues comes from the sale of inventoried equipment that we acquire through trade-ins from our equipment customers and selective purchases of high-quality used equipment. Our policy is not to offer specified price trade-in arrangements on equipment for sale. Sales of our rental fleet equipment allow us to manage the size, quality, composition and age of our rental fleet, and provide us with a profitable distribution channel for the disposal of rental equipment.\nParts Sales. We generate revenues from the sale of new and used parts for equipment that we rent or sell, as well as for other makes of equipment. Our product support sales representatives are instrumental in generating our parts revenues. They are product specialists and receive performance incentives for achieving certain sales levels. Most of our parts sales come from our extensive in-house parts inventory. Our parts sales provide us with a relatively stable revenue stream that is generally less sensitive to the economic cycles that tend to affect our rental and equipment sales operations.\nServices. We derive our services revenues from maintenance and repair services to customers for their owned equipment. In addition to repair and maintenance on an as-needed or scheduled basis, we also provide ongoing preventative maintenance services to industrial customers. Our after-market service provides a high-margin, relatively stable source of revenue through changing economic cycles.\nOur non-segmented other revenues for the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K relate to equipment support activities that we provide, such as transportation, hauling, parts freight and damage waivers, and are not generally allocated to reportable segments.\nPrincipal Costs and Expenses\nOur largest expenses are the costs to purchase the new equipment we sell, the costs associated with the used equipment we sell, rental expenses, rental depreciation and costs associated with parts sales and services, all of which are included in cost of revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our total cost of revenues was approximately $800.4 million. Our operating expenses consist principally of selling, general and administrative expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our selling, general and administrative expenses were $278.3 million. In addition, we have interest expense related to our debt instruments. Operating expenses and all other income and expense items below the gross profit line of our consolidated statements of income are not generally allocated to our reportable segments.\nWe are also subject to federal and state income taxes. Future income tax examinations by state and federal agencies could result in additional income tax expense based on probable outcomes of such matters.\nCost of Revenues:\nRental Depreciation. Depreciation of rental equipment represents the depreciation costs attributable to rental equipment. Estimated useful lives vary based upon type of equipment. Generally, we depreciate cranes and aerial work platforms over a ten year estimated useful life, earthmoving over a five year estimated useful life with a 25% salvage value, and industrial lift trucks over a seven year estimated useful life. Attachments and other smaller type equipment are depreciated over a three year estimated useful life. We periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives assigned to rental equipment.\nRental Expense. Rental expense represents the costs associated with rental equipment, including, among other things, the cost of servicing and maintaining our rental equipment, property taxes on our fleet and other miscellaneous costs of rental equipment.\nNew Equipment Sales. Cost of new equipment sold primarily consists of the equipment cost of the new equipment that is sold, net of any amount of credit given to the customer towards the equipment for trade-ins.\nUsed Equipment Sales. Cost of used equipment sold consists of the net book value of rental equipment for used equipment sold from our rental fleet, the equipment costs for used equipment we purchase for sale or the trade-in value of used equipment that we obtain from customers in equipment sales transactions.\nParts Sales. Cost of parts sales represents costs attributable to the sale of parts directly to customers.\nServices Support. Cost of services revenues represents costs attributable to service provided for the maintenance and repair of customer-owned equipment and equipment then on-rent by customers.\nOur non-segmented other expenses for the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include costs associated with providing transportation, hauling, parts freight, and damage waiver including, among other items, drivers' wages, fuel costs, shipping costs, and our costs related to damage waiver policies.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses:\nOur selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses include sales and marketing expenses, payroll and related benefit costs, including stock compensation expense, insurance expenses, legal and professional fees, rent and other occupancy costs, property and other taxes, administrative overhead, depreciation associated with property and equipment (other than rental equipment) and amortization expense associated with intangible assets. These expenses are not generally allocated to our reportable segments.\nInterest Expense:\nInterest expense for the periods presented represents the interest on our outstanding debt instruments, including aggregate amounts outstanding under our revolving senior secured credit facility (the Credit Facility\u201d), senior unsecured notes due 2025 and our capital lease obligations, as well as our extinguished senior unsecured notes due 2022 (the Old Notes\u201d) for the periods during which such Old Notes were outstanding. Interest expense also includes interest on our outstanding manufacturer flooring plans payable which are used to finance inventory and rental equipment purchases. Non-cash interest expense related to the amortization cost of deferred financing costs and the accretion/amortization of note discount/premium are also included in interest expense.\nPrincipal Cash Flows\nWe generate cash primarily from our operating activities and, historically, we have used cash flows from operating activities, manufacturer floor plan financings and available borrowings under the Credit Facility as the primary sources of funds to purchase inventory and to fund working capital and capital expenditures, growth and expansion opportunities (see also Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below). Our management of our working capital is closely tied to operating cash flows, as working capital can be significantly impacted by, among other things, our accounts receivable activities, the level of new and used equipment inventories, which may increase or decrease in response to current and expected demand, and the size and timing of our trade accounts payable payment cycles.\nRental Fleet\nA substantial portion of our overall value is in our rental fleet equipment. The net book value of our rental equipment at December 31, 2018 was $1.14 billion, or approximately 66.1% of our total assets. Our rental fleet as of December 31, 2018 consisted of 40,542 units having an original acquisition cost (which we define as the cost originally paid to manufacturers or the original amount financed under any operating leases) of approximately $1.76 billion. As of December 31, 2018, our rental fleet composition was as follows (dollars in millions):\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Units\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of\nTotal\nUnits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Original\nAcquisition\nCost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Original\nAcquisition\nCost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average\nAge in\nMonths\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hi-Lift or Aerial Work Platforms\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 67.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,155.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cranes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 92.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earthmoving\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 366.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Industrial Lift Trucks\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 110.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,763.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDetermining the optimal age and mix for our rental fleet equipment is subjective and requires considerable estimates and judgments by management. We constantly evaluate the mix, age and quality of the equipment in our rental fleet in response to current economic and market conditions, competition and customer demand. The mix and age of our rental fleet, as well as our cash flows, are impacted by sales of equipment from the rental fleet, which are influenced by used equipment pricing at the retail and secondary auction market levels, and the capital expenditures to acquire new rental fleet equipment. In making equipment acquisition decisions, we evaluate current economic and market conditions, competition, manufacturers' availability, pricing and return on investment over the estimated useful life of the specific equipment, among other things. As a result of our in-house service capabilities and extensive maintenance program, we believe our rental fleet is well-maintained.\nThe original acquisition cost of our gross rental fleet increased by approximately $361.0 million, or 25.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, largely reflective of the CEC and Rental Inc. acquired fleets, combined with increase in 2018 rental capital expenditures to meet customer demand. The average age of our rental fleet equipment decreased by approximately 0.1 months for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOur average rental rates for the year ended December 31, 2018 were approximately 2.1% higher than the year ended December 31, 2017 (see further discussion on rental rates in Results of Operations\u201d below).\nThe rental equipment mix among our four core product lines for the year ended December 31, 2018 was largely consistent with that of the prior year comparable period as a percentage of total units available for rent and as a percentage of original acquisition cost.\nPrincipal External Factors that Affect our Businesses\nWe are subject to a number of external factors that may adversely affect our businesses. These factors, and other factors, are discussed below and under the heading Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d and in Item 1A - Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Economic downturns. The demand for our products is dependent on the general economy, the stability of the global credit markets, the industries in which our customers operate or serve, and other factors. Downturns in the general economy or in the construction and manufacturing industries, as well as adverse credit market conditions, can cause demand for our products to materially decrease.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Spending levels by customers. Rentals and sales of equipment to the construction industry and to industrial companies constitute a significant portion of our total revenues. As a result, we depend upon customers in these businesses and their ability and willingness to make capital expenditures to rent or buy specialized equipment. Accordingly, our business is impacted by fluctuations in customers' spending levels on capital expenditures and by the availability of credit to those customers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Adverse weather. Adverse weather in a geographic region in which we operate may depress demand for equipment in that region. Our equipment is primarily used outdoors and, as a result, prolonged adverse weather conditions may prohibit our customers from continuing their work projects. Adverse weather also has a seasonal impact in parts of our Intermountain region, particularly in the winter months.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Regional and Industry-Specific Activity and Trends. Expenditures by our customers may be impacted by the overall level of construction activity in the markets and regions in which they operate, the price of oil and other commodities and other general economic trends impacting the industries in which our customers and end users operate. As our customers adjust their activity and spending levels in response to these external factors, our rentals and sales of equipment to those customers will be impacted. For example, high levels of industrial activity in our Gulf Coast and Intermountain regions have been a meaningful driver of recent growth in our revenues. However, the decline in oil and natural gas prices and the related downturn in oil industry activities during fiscal years 2014, 2015 and 2016 resulted in a significant decrease in our new equipment sales, primarily the sale of new cranes, due to lower demand. Although oil prices have subsequently stabilized and improved in 2017 and into 2018, prices decreased significantly at the end of 2018 into early 2019 and we believe the uncertainty regarding future oil prices continues to impact customer capital expenditure decisions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that our integrated business tempers the effects of downturns in a particular segment. For a discussion of seasonality, see Seasonality\u201d on page 47 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The application of many accounting principles requires us to make assumptions, estimates and/or judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These assumptions, estimates and/or judgments, however, are often subjective and they and our actual results may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analyses. If actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts first become known. We believe the following critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions, estimates and/or judgments. See also note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition. Upon our adoption of Topic 606 on January 1, 2018, we recognize revenue in accordance with two applicable accounting standards: 1) Topic 606 and 2) Topic 840 (which addresses lease accounting). Topic 606 superseded Topic 605 and other legacy industry-specific revenue recognition guidance.\nUnder Topic 606, revenue from contracts with customers is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract with the customer and excludes any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. We recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for such products or services.\nThe accounting for the types of revenues accounted for pursuant to Topic 606 is discussed below. Substantially all of our revenues under Topic 606 are recognized at a point-in-time rather than over time.\nRental revenues: An insignificant portion of our total equipment rental revenues are recognized pursuant to Topic 606 rather than pursuant to Topic 840. These revenues represent services performed by us in connection with the rental of equipment and are comprised of customer training fees on rented equipment and erection and dismantling services on rental equipment. Revenues for these services are recognized upon completion of such services. See discussion below regarding rental revenues recognized pursuant to Topic 840.\nNew equipment sales: Revenues from the sales of new equipment are recognized at the time of delivery to, or pick-up by, the customer, which is when the customer obtains control of the promised good.\nUsed equipment sales: Revenues from the sales of used equipment are recognized at the time of delivery to, or pick-up by, the customer, which is when the customer obtains control of the promised good.\nParts sales: Revenues from the sales of equipment parts are recognized at the time of pick-up by the customer for parts counter sales transactions. For parts that are shipped to a customer, we elected to use a practical expedient of Topic 606 and treat such shipping activities as fulfillment costs, thereby recognizing revenues at the time of shipment.\nServices revenues: We derive our services primarily from maintenance and repair services to customers for their owned equipment. We recognize services revenues at the time such services are completed, which is when the customer obtains control of the promised service.\nOther revenues: Other revenues relate primarily to hauling fees for transporting rental equipment and equipment sold to and from the customer and ancillary charges associated with equipment maintenance and repair services. Such revenues are recognized at the time the services are performed.\nPursuant to Topic 840, we accounted, for the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for equipment rental agreements as operating leases and recognized revenue from equipment rentals in the period earned, regardless of the timing of billing to customers. A rental contract includes rates for daily, weekly or monthly use, and rental revenues are earned on a daily basis as rental contracts remain outstanding. Because rental contracts can extend across multiple reporting periods, we record unbilled rental revenues and deferred rental revenues at the end of reporting periods so rental revenues earned is appropriately stated for the periods presented. We recognize revenue for certain ancillary fees we charge customers: to protect the customer against liability for damage to our equipment while on rent; for fuel; and for environmental costs. Revenues from these ancillary fees are recognized in the period earned. Under Topic 840, we present these ancillary fees we charge to customers in other revenues. Effective January 1, 2019, Topic 842 became effective, replacing Topic 840. See also the Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d discussion in note 2 to these consolidated financial statements for further information related to our adoption of Topic 606 on January 1, 2018 and Topic 842, which became effective on January 1, 2019.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts that reflects our estimate of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect. We develop our estimate of this allowance based on our historical experience with specific customers, our understanding of our current economic circumstances and our own judgment as to the likelihood of ultimate payment. Our largest exposure to doubtful accounts is in our rental operations. We perform credit evaluations of customers and establish credit limits based on reviews of our customers' current credit information and payment histories. We believe our credit risk is somewhat mitigated by our geographically diverse customer base and our credit evaluation procedures. During the year, we write-off customer account balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote. Such write-offs are charged against our allowance for doubtful accounts. Bad debt expense as a percentage of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were approximately 0.2%, 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively. The actual rate of future credit losses, however, may not be similar to past experience. Our estimate of doubtful accounts could change based on changing circumstances, including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers. Accordingly, we may be required to increase or decrease our allowance for doubtful accounts. See also Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements regarding pending a pending accounting pronouncement related to estimating credit losses.\nUseful Lives of Rental Equipment and Property and Equipment. We depreciate rental equipment and property and equipment over their estimated useful lives (generally three to ten years), after giving effect to an estimated salvage value ranging from 0% to 25% of cost. The useful life of rental equipment is determined based on our estimate of the period the asset will generate revenues, and the salvage value is determined based on our estimate of the minimum value we could realize from the asset after such period. We periodically review the assumptions utilized in computing rates of depreciation. We may be required to change these estimates based on changes in our industry or other changing circumstances. If these estimates change in the future, we may be required to recognize increased or decreased depreciation expense for these assets.\nThe amount of depreciation expense we record is highly dependent upon the estimated useful lives and the salvage values assigned to each category of rental equipment. Generally, we assign estimated useful lives to our rental fleet ranging from a three-year life, five-year life with a 25% salvage value, seven-year life and a ten-year life. Depreciation expense on our rental fleet for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $208.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the estimated impact of a change in estimated useful lives for each category of equipment by two years was as follows:\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Hi-Lift or\nAerial Work\nPlatforms\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cranes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Earth-\nmoving\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Industrial\nLift\nTrucks\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impact of 2-year change in useful life on results of\noperations for the year ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation expense for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 108.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 64.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 208.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase of 2 years in useful life\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 88.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 153.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Decrease of 2 years in useful life\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 133.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 81.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 252.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor purposes of the sensitivity analysis above, we elected not to decrease the useful lives of other equipment, which are primarily three-year estimated useful life assets; rather, we have held the depreciation expense constant at the actual amount of depreciation expense. We believe that decreasing the life of the other equipment by two years is an unreasonable estimate and would potentially lead to the decision to expense, rather than capitalize, a significant portion of the subject asset class. In general terms, a one-year increase in the estimated life across all classes of our rental equipment will give rise to an approximate decrease in our annual depreciation expense of approximately $27.3 million. Additionally, a one-year decrease in the estimated life across all classes of our rental equipment (with the exception of other equipment as discussed above) will give rise to an approximate increase in our annual depreciation expense of approximately $22.2 million.\nAnother significant assumption used in our calculation of depreciation expense is the estimated salvage value assigned to our earthmoving equipment. Based on our recent experience, we have used a 25% factor of the equipment's original cost to estimate its salvage value. This factor is highly subjective and subject to change in the future based upon actual results at the time we dispose of the equipment. A change of 5%, either increase or decrease, in the estimated salvage value would result in a change in our annual depreciation expense of approximately $3.2 million.\nPurchase Price Allocation. We have made significant acquisitions in the past and we intend to make additional acquisitions in the future that meet our selection criteria that solidify our presence in the contiguous regions where we operate with an objective of increasing our revenues, improving our profitability, entering additional attractive markets and strengthening our competitive position. Pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 350 ( ASC 350\u201d), Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, we record as goodwill the excess of the consideration transferred plus the fair value of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired. Such fair market value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by various factors over time, which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates.\nWith the exception of goodwill, long-lived fixed assets generally represent the largest component of our acquisitions. Typically, the long-lived fixed assets that we acquire are primarily comprised of rental fleet equipment. Historically, virtually all of the rental equipment that we have acquired through business combinations have been classified as To be Used,\u201d rather than as To be Sold.\u201d Equipment that we acquire and classify as To be Used\u201d is recorded at fair value. Any significant inventories of new and used equipment acquired in the transaction are valued at fair value, which should approximate a market participant's estimated selling price adjusted for (1) costs in the selling effort and (2) a reasonable profit allowance.\nIn addition to long-lived fixed assets, we also acquire other assets and assume liabilities. These other assets and liabilities typically include, but are not limited to, parts inventory, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other working capital items. Because of their short-term nature, the fair values of these assets and liabilities generally approximate the carrying values reflected on the acquired entities balance sheets. However, when appropriate, we adjust these carrying values for factors such as collectibility and existence. The intangible assets that we have acquired generally consist primarily of the goodwill recognized. Depending upon the applicable purchase agreement and the particular facts and circumstances of the business acquired, we may identify other intangible assets, such as trade names or trademarks, non-compete agreements and customer-related intangibles (specifically, customer relationships). A trademark has a fair value equal to the present value of the royalty income attributable to it. The royalty income attributable to a trademark represents the hypothetical cost savings that are derived from owning the trademark instead of paying royalties to license the trademark from another owner. When specifically negotiated by the parties in the applicable purchase\nagreements, we base the value of non-compete agreements on the amounts assigned to them in the purchase agreements as these amounts represent the amounts negotiated in an arm's length transaction. When not negotiated by the parties in the applicable purchase agreements, the fair value of non-compete agreements is estimated based on an income approach since their values are representative of the current and future revenue and profit erosion protection they provide. Customer relationships are generally valued based on an excess earnings or income approach with consideration to projected cash flows. We use an independent third party valuation firm to assist us with estimating the fair values of our acquired intangible assets.\nGoodwill. We have made acquisitions in the past that resulted in the recognition of goodwill. Pursuant to ASC 350, goodwill is the excess of the consideration transferred plus the fair value of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if triggering events occur or other impairment indicators arise which might impair recoverability.\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including: the identification of reporting units; assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units; assignment of goodwill to reporting units; determination of the fair value of each reporting unit; and an assumption as to the form of the transaction in which the reporting unit would be acquired by a market participant (either a taxable or nontaxable transaction). Impairment of goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment (i.e., before aggregation or combination), or one level below an operating segment (i.e., a component). A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. Pursuant to ASC 350 and ASC 280, Segment Reporting, and other relevant guidance, we have identified two components within our Rental operating segment (Equipment Rentals Component 1 and Equipment Rentals Component 2) and have determined that each of our other four operating segments (New Equipment, Used Equipment, Parts, and Service segments) represents a reporting unit, resulting in six total reporting units.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our goodwill was comprised of the following carrying values for our six reporting units (amounts in thousands):\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td> Reporting Unit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Carrying Value\nat December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equipment Rentals Component 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 34,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equipment Rentals Component 2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 42,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> New Equipment Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Used Equipment Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Parts Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Services Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Goodwill\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 105,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nASC 350 permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not (a likelihood of greater than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case, the currently prescribed two-step goodwill test must be performed. Otherwise, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. Considerable judgment is required by management in using the qualitative approach under ASC 350 to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. ASC 350 suggests that a qualitative assessment may become less relevant over time. In other words, the longer it has been since the last quantitative assessment, the more difficult it could be for a company to conclude that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Our most recent quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment was as of October 1, 2016, whereby we bypassed the qualitative assessment for each reporting unit and proceeded directly to Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test. Our goodwill impairment testing as of that date indicated that there was no impairment among our reporting units as estimated fair values exceeded their respective carrying amounts.\nDuring 2017 and 2018, we performed, as of October 1 of each respective year, a qualitative assessment and determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units is not less than its carrying value and, therefore, did not perform the prescribed two-step goodwill impairment test. We considered various factors in performing the qualitative test, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, the overall financial performance of our reporting units, the Company's stock price and the excess amount or cushion\u201d between our reporting unit's fair value and carrying value as indicated on our most recent quantitative assessment. Based upon improving macroeconomic conditions, positive trends within our industry and market and continuing positive operating results in comparison to prior periods and our internal forecasts, as well as consideration of the cushion between the reporting unit's fair value and carrying value from our prior quantitative analysis, we determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units exceeds their respective carrying values at the October 1, 2017 and 2018 valuation dates and there was no goodwill impairment at October 1, 2017 or 2018.\nIf the two-step goodwill test must be performed, we determine whether the fair value of our goodwill reporting units is greater than their carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired. However, if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then the second step of the impairment test is performed to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we record an impairment loss for the excess amount. See also the Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d discussion in note 2 to these consolidated financial statements for new pending accounting guidance, which removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test.\nFor purposes of performing the first step of the impairment test described above, we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis and/or by applying various market multiples. The principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis are our internal projected results of operations, weighted average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d) and terminal value assumptions.\nOur internal projected results of operations serve as key inputs for developing our cash flow projections for a planning period of twelve years. Beyond this period, we also determine an assumed long-term growth rate representing the expected rate at which a reporting unit's earnings stream is expected to grow. These rates are used to calculate the terminal value of our reporting units and are added to the cash flows projected during the twelve year planning period. The WACC is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise and represents the expected cost of new capital likely to be used by market participants. The WACC is used to discount our combined future cash flows.\nThe inputs and variables used in determining the fair value of a reporting unit require management to make certain assumptions regarding the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes, as well as estimates of future cash flows. Our estimates regarding future cash flows are based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance, including revenues, margins and operating expenses. These estimates involve risk and are inherently uncertain. Changes in our estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or the amount of goodwill impairment to be recognized. However, we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and represent our most likely future operating results based upon current information available. Future deterioration in the macroeconomic environment, adverse changes within our industry, further deterioration in our common stock price, downward revisions to our projected cash flows based on new information, or other factors, some of which are beyond our ability to control, could result in a future impairment charge that could materially impact our future results of operations and financial position in the reporting period identified.\nLong-lived Assets. Our long-lived assets principally consist of rental equipment and property and equipment. We review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In reviewing for impairment, the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset's recorded value, an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value. The determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of long-lived and intangible assets involves significant estimates and judgment on the part of management. Our estimates and assumptions may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as changes in economic conditions, changes in our business prospects or other changing circumstances.\nInventories. We state our new and used equipment inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value by specific identification. Parts and supplies are stated at the lower of the weighted average cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is considered to be the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable cost of completion, disposal and transportation. We maintain allowances for damaged, slow-moving and unmarketable inventory to reflect the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value. Changes in product demand may affect the value of inventory on hand and may require higher inventory allowances. Uncertainties with respect to inventory valuation are inherent in the preparation of financial statements.\nReserves for Claims. We are exposed to various claims relating to our business, including those for which we provide self-insurance. Claims for which we self-insure up to specified retention limits include: (1) workers compensation claims; (2) general liability claims by third parties for injury or property damage caused by our equipment or personnel; (3) automobile liability claims; and (4) employee health insurance claims. These types of claims may take a substantial amount of time to resolve and, accordingly, the ultimate liability associated with a particular claim, including claims incurred but not reported as of a period-end reporting date, may not be known for an extended period of time. Our methodology for developing self-insurance reserves is based on management estimates and independent third party actuarial estimates. Our estimation process considers, among other matters, the cost of known claims over time, cost inflation and incurred but not reported claims. These estimates may change based on, among other things, changes in our claim history or receipt of additional information relevant to assessing the claims. Further, these estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as adverse judicial determinations or other claim settlements at higher than estimated amounts. Accordingly, we may be required to increase or decrease our reserve levels.\nIncome Taxes. The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return with its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company is a C-Corporation under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. We utilize the asset and liability approach to measure deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences existing at each balance sheet date using currently enacted tax rates in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740\u201d). ASC 740 takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rate is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date of that tax rate.\nIn accordance with ASC 740, the Company recognizes the effect of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not (a likelihood of greater than 50%) that such position will be sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company recognizes both interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in net other income (expense).\nOur deferred tax calculation requires management to make certain estimates about future operations. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nOur U.S. federal tax returns for 2015 and subsequent years remain subject to examination by tax authorities. We are also subject to examination in various state jurisdictions for 2013 and subsequent years.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Act was signed into law. Included in the Act is a reduction in the corporate statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective for us as of January 1, 2018. Under ASC 740, the effects of changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which the new legislation is enacted. In the case of U.S. federal income taxes, the enactment date is the date the bill becomes law (i.e., upon presidential signature). We have completed our accounting for all the tax effects of the enactment of the Act.\nResults of Operations\nThe tables included in the period-to-period comparisons below provide summaries of our revenues and gross profits for our business segments and non-segmented revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Our total revenues were $1.24 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $1.03 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $208.9 million, or 20.3%. Revenues increased for all of our reportable segments and non-segmented other revenues and are further discussed below.\nEquipment Rental Revenues. Our revenues from equipment rentals for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $113.2 million, or 23.6%, to $592.2 million from $479.0 million in 2017. The increase in equipment rental revenues was largely due to increased demand and the equipment rental revenues from our CEC and Rental Inc. locations.\nRental revenues from aerial work platform equipment increased $66.7 million and earthmoving equipment rental revenues increased $24.3 million, while rental revenues from other equipment and lift trucks increased $8.5 million and $3.0 million, respectively. Partially offsetting these increases in equipment rental revenues was a $1.1 million decrease in crane rental revenues. The product line equipment rental revenue fluctuations above do not include the impact of legacy CEC and Rental Inc. equipment rental revenues by product line for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, respectively.\nOur average rental rates for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased 2.1% compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Our average rental rates for the year ended December 31, 2018 do not include rental rate data for legacy CEC and Rental Inc. for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, respectively.\nRental equipment dollar utilization (annual rental revenues divided by the average original rental fleet equipment costs) for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased 0.9% to 35.8% from 34.9% in 2017. The increase in comparative rental equipment dollar utilization was primarily the result of the increase in equipment rental rates, combined with the mix of equipment rented, which was partially offset by a decrease in rental equipment time utilization. Rental equipment time utilization as a percentage of original equipment cost was approximately 71.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 72.1% in the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of 0.5%.\nNew Equipment Sales Revenues. Our new equipment sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $59.6 million, or 29.3%, to $262.9 million from $203.3 million in 2017. This increase, as noted below, was driven primarily by increased sales of new cranes and aerial work platform equipment, combined with the new equipment sales revenues from our Rental Inc. locations.\nSales of new cranes increased $44.3 million, resulting from improved crane demand. Sales of new aerial work platform equipment increased $13.8 million. Sales of new lift trucks and new earthmoving equipment increased $1.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively. Partially offsetting these increases in new equipment sales was a $3.3 million decrease in new other equipment sales. The product line new equipment sales revenue fluctuations above do not include the impact of legacy CEC and Rental Inc. new equipment sales revenues by product line for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, respectively.\nUsed Equipment Sales Revenues. Our used equipment sales increased $17.8 million, or 16.6%, to $125.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, from $107.3 million for the same period in 2017.\nSales of used aerial work platform equipment increased $24.8 million while sales of used other equipment and used cranes increased $2.4 million and $1.5 million, respectively. Partially offsetting these increases in used equipment sales were a $9.6 million decrease in used earthmoving equipment sales and a $1.8 million decrease in used lift truck sales. The product line used equipment sales revenue fluctuations above do not include the impact of legacy CEC and Rental Inc. used equipment sales revenues by product line for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, respectively.\nParts Sales Revenues. Our parts sales revenues increased $6.2 million, or 5.4%, to $120.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $114.3 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in parts sales was largely attributable to increases in crane parts sales, aerial work platform equipment parts sales and earthmoving equipment parts sales, combined with parts sales revenues from our CEC and Rental Inc. locations.\nServices Revenues. Our services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $0.6 million, or 1.0%, to $63.5 million from $62.9 million in the same period last year. The increase in services revenues was primarily due to services revenues from our CEC and Rental Inc. locations.\nNon-Segmented Other Revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our other revenues were $74.8 million, an increase of approximately $11.5 million, or 18.2%, from $63.2 million in 2017. This increase was primarily driven by higher hauling revenues and damage waiver income associated with our equipment rental activities, combined with non-segmented other revenues from our CEC and Rental Inc. locations.\nGross Profit.\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total Dollar\nChange\nIncrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\nPercentage\nChange\nIncrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment Gross Profit (Loss):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equipment rentals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 294,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 231,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 62,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> New equipment sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Used equipment sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Parts sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Services revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,762\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-Segmented revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (623\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 99.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 438,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 359,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 78,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal Gross Profit. Our total gross profit was $438.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $359.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $78.6 million, or 21.8%. Total gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately 35.4%, an increase of 0.5% from the 34.9% gross profit margin for the same period in 2017. Gross profit and gross margin for all reportable segments and non-segmented other revenues are further described below.\nEquipment Rentals Gross Profit. Our gross profit from equipment rentals for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $62.4 million, or 26.9%, to approximately $294.2 million from $231.9 million in 2017.\nThe increase in equipment rentals gross profit was the result of a $113.2 million increase in equipment rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to last year, which was partially offset by a $38.9 million increase in rental equipment depreciation expense and an $11.9 million increase in rental expenses. The increases in both depreciation expense and rental expenses are primarily due to a larger fleet size in 2018 compared to 2017.\nGross profit margin on equipment rentals for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately 49.7% compared to 48.4% in 2017, an increase of 1.3%. As a percentage of equipment rental revenues, rental expenses were 15.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 16.2% for the same period last year, a decrease of 1.1%, resulting primarily from the increase in equipment rental revenues. Depreciation expense was 35.2% of equipment rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 35.4% for the same period in 2017, a decrease of 0.2%, primarily as a result of the increase in equipment rental revenues, which was partially offset by the increase in depreciation expense resulting from the purchase accounting fair value step up adjustments on the CEC and Rental Inc. acquired rental fleets, and the mix of our equipment rental fleet.\nNew Equipment Sales Gross Profit. Our new equipment sales gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $8.3 million, or 36.7%, to $30.9 million compared to $22.6 million in 2017 on an increase in total new equipment sales of $59.6 million. Gross profit margin on new equipment sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately 11.7%, an increase of 0.6% from 11.1% in 2017, as a result of higher new crane and aerial work platform sales gross margins and the mix of new equipment sold.\nUsed Equipment Sales Gross Profit. Our used equipment sales gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased approximately $5.9 million, or 17.7%, to $39.1 million from $33.2 million in 2017 on a used equipment sales increase of $17.8 million. Gross profit margin on used equipment sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 31.2%, up 0.3% from 30.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of the mix of used equipment sold and higher used equipment margins on used aerial work platform equipment sales. These improved gross margins were partially offset by lower margins on sales of CEC and Rental Inc. used equipment, reflecting the purchase accounting fair value step up basis adjustment applied to the acquired used equipment inventory and rental equipment.\nOur used equipment sales from the rental fleet, which comprised approximately 89.6% and 89.7% of our used equipment sales for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were approximately 152.1% and 149.6% of net book value for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nParts Sales Gross Profit. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our parts sales revenue gross profit increased $1.1 million, or 3.4%, to $32.2 million from $31.1 million for the same period in 2017 on a $6.2 million increase in parts sales revenues. Gross profit margin on parts sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 26.7%, a decrease of 0.5% from 27.2% in the same period in 2017, as a result of the mix of parts sold.\nServices Revenues Gross Profit. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our services revenues gross profit increased $0.4 million, or 1.0%, to $42.2 million from $41.8 million for the same period in 2017 on a $0.6 million increase in services revenues. Gross profit margin on services revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was 66.4%.\nNon-Segmented Other Revenues Gross Profit. Our non-segmented other revenues gross loss was approximately $1 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to a gross loss of $0.6 million for the same period last year, a decrease of $0.6 million. Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 0.0% compared to a gross margin of (1.0)% in 2017, an improvement of 1.0%, primarily reflective of improved gross margins on hauling and transportation related charges in the current period and improved gross margin on damage waiver income.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A expenses increased $45.5 million, or approximately 19.6%, to $278.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $232.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe net increase in SG&A expenses was attributable to several factors. Employee salaries, wages, payroll taxes and related employee benefit and other employee expenses increased $30.8 million, primarily as a result of our CEC and Rental Inc. acquisitions, a larger workforce and higher incentive compensation related to improved profitability. Legal and professional fees increased $3.6 million. Supply costs increased $2.0 million. Utilities costs increased $1.7 million and other facility-related expenses increased $1.8 million. Promotional expenses increased $1.1 million. Liability insurance costs increased $0.9 million. Additionally, our results for the year ended December 31, 2018 also includes $3.3 million of amortization expense associated with the recognition of intangible assets resulting from the CEC and Rental Inc. purchase price allocations.\nApproximately $4.0 million of the total increase in SG&A expenses was attributable to branches opened since January 1, 2017 (but excluding for this purpose branches acquired as a result of our CEC and Rental Inc. acquisitions) with less than a full year of comparable operations in either or both of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nAs a percentage of total revenues, SG&A expenses were 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 22.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of 0.1%.\nMerger Costs (net of Merger Breakup Fee Proceeds). Pursuant to the terms of our terminated 2017 merger agreement with Neff Corporation ( Neff\u201d), we received a $13.2 million breakup fee concurrently with Neff's termination of the merger agreement in the third quarter of 2017. Related estimated merger transaction fees related to Neff and other acquisition-related activity for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $6.7 million, resulting in estimated net proceeds of $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nMerger costs incurred in the year ended December 31, 2018 were approximately $0.7 million.\nGain on Sales of Property and Equipment, Net. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold a parcel of company-owned land and realized a gain of approximately $3.7 million, resulting in total net gains on sales of property and equipment of $7.1 million for the period, compared to $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $2.1 million.\nOther Income (Expense). For the year ended December 31, 2018, our net other expenses decreased approximately $16.6 million to $62.0 million compared to $78.6 million for the same period in 2017. Included in Other Income (Expense) for the year ended December 31, 2017 is a $25.4 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt (see Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt\u201d below).\nInterest expense increased approximately $8.7 million to $63.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $55.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in interest expense was due to additional interest costs of $7.2 million associated with the upsize of our $950 million 5.625% senior unsecured notes that were issued in the third and fourth quarters of 2017 compared to our $630 million 7% senior unsecured notes, which were retired in the third quarter of 2017. Interest costs related to the Credit Facility increased $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period last year.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. We recorded a one-time loss on the early extinguishment of debt in the three month period ended September 30, 2017 of approximately $25.4 million, reflecting payment of $12.8 million of tender premiums associated with our repurchase of the Old Notes and $10.5 million of premiums in accordance with the indenture governing the Old Notes to redeem the remaining untendered Old Notes, combined with the write off of approximately $2.0 million of unamortized note premium, unaccreted note discount and unamortized deferred financing costs, related to the Old Notes\nIncome Taxes. We recorded income tax expense of $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to an income tax benefit of approximately $50.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 26.8%.\nThe 2017 income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was the result of the Act being signed into law on December 22, 2017. Under ASC 740, the effects of changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which the new legislation is enacted. With respect to U.S. federal income taxes, the enactment date is the date the bill becomes law (i.e. upon presidential signature). Therefore, we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 a one-time decrease in income tax expense of $66.9 million from the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the decrease in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% under the Act. Our accounting for the income tax effects of the Act has been completed.\nBased on available evidence, both positive and negative, we believe it is more likely than not that our federal deferred tax assets at December 31, 2018 are fully realizable through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income, and are not subject to any limitations. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we decreased our valuation allowance by $0.1 million for certain state net operating losses that were utilized.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRevenues.\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Dollar\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equipment rentals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 479,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 445,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> New equipment sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 203,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 196,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Used equipment sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 107,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 96,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Parts sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 114,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 115,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,736\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Services revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 62,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,800\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-Segmented other revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,030,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 978,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 51,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal Revenues. Our total revenues were $1.03 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to approximately $978.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $51.9 million, or 5.3%. Revenues for our reportable segments and non-segmented other revenues are further discussed below.\nEquipment Rental Revenues. Our revenues from equipment rentals for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $33.8 million, or 7.6%, to $479.0 million from $445.2 million in 2016. Rental revenues from aerial work platform equipment increased $30.7 million and earthmoving equipment rental revenues increased $5.5 million, while rental revenues from other equipment and lift trucks increased $2.8 million and $0.5 million, respectively. Partially offsetting these increases in equipment rental revenues was a $5.7 million decrease in crane rental revenues. Our average rental rates for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 0.2% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nRental equipment dollar utilization (annual rental revenues divided by the average original rental fleet equipment costs) for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 0.9% to 34.9% from 34.0% in 2016. The increase in comparative rental equipment dollar utilization was the result of an increase in rental equipment time utilization, combined with a 0.2% increase in average rental rates. Rental equipment time utilization as a percentage of original equipment cost was 72.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to approximately 69.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 2.4%. The increase in equipment rental time utilization based on original equipment cost is largely reflective of increased demand in 2017 for rental equipment, especially aerial work platform equipment.\nNew Equipment Sales Revenues. Our new equipment sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $6.6 million, or 3.4%, to $203.3 million from $196.7 million in 2016, as new crane sales increased $11.8 million. Sales of new other equipment increased $7.1 million and sales of new aerial work platform equipment increased $3.3 million. Partially offsetting these increases in new equipment sales were a $15.3 million decrease in new earthmoving equipment sales and a $0.3 million decrease in new lift truck sales.\nUsed Equipment Sales Revenues. Our used equipment sales increased $10.4 million, or 10.8%, to $107.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $96.9 million for the same period in 2016. Sales of used earthmoving equipment increased $5.4 million and sales of used cranes increased $3.1 million. Sales of used other equipment increased $1.2 million, while sales of used lift trucks and used aerial work platform equipment increased $0.5 million and $0.2 million, respectively.\nParts Sales Revenues. Our parts sales revenues decreased approximately $1.8 million, or 1.6%, to $107.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $109.1 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease in parts revenues was driven primarily by lower crane parts sales revenues.\nServices Revenues. Our services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased $1.8 million, or 2.8%, to $62.9 million from $64.7 million in the same period in 2016. The decrease in services revenues was due to lower crane services revenues and lower other equipment services revenues.\nNon-Segmented Other Revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our other revenues were $70.1 million, an increase of approximately $4.6 million, or 7.1%, from $65.5 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in hauling revenues, fuel charges and damage waiver income associated with the increase in our equipment rental activity.\nGross Profit.\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total Dollar\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment Gross Profit (Loss):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equipment rentals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 231,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 211,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> New equipment sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Used equipment sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Parts sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (544\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Services revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,762\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,072\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-Segmented revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (623\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,307\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (52.3\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 359,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 335,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal Gross Profit.

Total gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately 34.9%, an increase of 0.6% from the 34.3% gross profit margin for the same period in 2016. Gross profit and gross margin for all reportable segments and non-segmented other revenues are further described below.\nEquipment Rentals Gross Profit. Our gross profit from equipment rentals for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $20.7 million, or 9.8%, to approximately $231.9 million from $211.1 million in 2016. The increase in equipment rentals gross profit was the result of a $33.8 million increase in rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was partially offset by a $7.l million increase in equipment rental depreciation expense and a $6.0 million increase in rental expenses. The increase in rental expenses is primarily due to higher repair costs and increased property taxes resulting from a larger rental fleet size. The increase in rental equipment depreciation expense is largely due also to a larger rental fleet size. Gross profit margin on equipment rentals for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately 48.4% compared to 47.4% for the same period in 2016, an increase of 1.0%. Depreciation expense was 35.4% of equipment rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 36.5% for the same period in 2016, a decrease of 1.1%. As a percentage of equipment rental revenues, rental expenses were 16.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to approximately 16.1% for the same period in 2016, an increase of 0.1%.\nNew Equipment Sales Gross Profit. Our new equipment sales gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $1.5 million, or 6.9%, to $22.6 million compared to $21.1 million for the same period in 2016 on an increase in total new equipment sales of $6.6 million. Gross profit margin on new equipment sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 11.1%, an increase of 0.4% from 10.7% in the same period in 2016, as a result of the mix of new equipment sold.\nUsed Equipment Sales Gross Profit. Our used equipment sales gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $3.0 million, or 10.0%, to $33.2 million from $30.2 million in the same period in 2016 on an increase in used equipment sales of $10.4 million. Gross profit margin on used equipment sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 30.9%, down 0.2% from 31.1% for the same period in 2016, primarily as a result of the mix of used equipment sold. Our used equipment sales from the rental fleet, which comprised approximately 89.7% and 87.1% of our used equipment sales for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, were approximately 149.6% and 152.4% of net book value for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nParts Sales Gross Profit. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our parts sales revenue gross profit decreased $0.5 million, or 1.7%, to $29.7 million from $30.2 million for the same period in 2016 on a $1.8 million decrease in parts sales revenues. Gross profit margin on parts sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 27.6%, a decrease of 0.1% from 27.7% in the same period in 2016, as a result of the mix of parts sold.\nServices Revenues Gross Profit. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our services revenues gross profit decreased approximately $1.1 million, or 2.5%, to $41.8 million from $42.8 million for the same period in 2016 on a $1.8 million decrease in services revenues. Gross profit margin on services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 66.4%, up 0.2% from 66.2% in the same period in 2016, as a result of services revenues mix.\nNon-Segmented Other Revenues Gross Profit. Our non-segmented other revenues gross profit increased approximately $0.6 million to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $0.2 million for the same period in 2016 on a $4.6 million increase in non-segmented other revenues. Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 1.2% compared to a gross margin of 0.3% in the same period 2016, an increase of 0.9%, primarily reflective of improved margins on hauling revenues compared to last year.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A expenses increased $4.7 million, or 2.0%, to $232.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $228.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in SG&A expenses was attributable to several factors. Employee salaries, wages, payroll taxes, employee benefit expenses and other employee costs increased approximately $7.6 million, primarily as a result of a larger workforce compared to the same period last year, an increase in incentive compensation associated with our increase in current year revenues, and higher employer health insurance costs. Facility costs increased $1.6 million, comprised primarily of additional rent expense related to new branches opened since the fourth quarter of last year. Bad debt expense increased $0.9 million, while supplies expense and other general corporate overhead expenses increased $0.5 million. Partially offsetting these increases was a $4.1 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense due to lower software amortization costs. Legal, professional and other service fees decreased $1.1 million. General liability insurance costs decreased $0.7 million.\nBranches opened since January 1, 2016 with less than twelve full months of comparable operations in 2016 and 2017 contributed $3.6 million to the increase in our SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016.\nAs a percentage of total revenues, SG&A expenses were 22.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of 0.7% from 23.3% for the same period in 2016, primarily as a result of the increase in 2017 total revenues.\nOther Income (Expense). For the year ended December 31, 2017, our net other expenses increased $26.8 million to $78.6 million, compared to $51.7 million in 2016. Included in Other Income (Expense) for the year ended December 31, 2017 is a $25.4 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt (see discussion immediately below regarding the issuance of the New Notes). Interest expense was $55.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $53.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $1.4 million. The increase in interest expense is primarily related to the timing of the issuance of the New Notes in relation to the redemption of the Old Notes. Our New Notes were issued on August 24, 2017, while approximately $300.3 million of the Old Notes remained outstanding until the September 25, 2017 redemption date. Miscellaneous other income was $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $1.9 million in 2016, a decrease of $0.1 million.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. As more fully described in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we recorded a one-time loss on the early extinguishment of debt in the year ended December 31, 2017 of approximately $25.4 million, reflecting payment of $12.8 million of tender premiums associated with our repurchase of the Old Notes and $10.5 million of premiums in accordance with the indenture governing the Old Notes to redeem the remaining untendered Old Notes, combined with the write off of approximately $2.0 million of unamortized note premium, unaccreted note discount and unamortized deferred financing costs, in each case, related to the Old Notes.\nMerger Costs (net of Merger Breakup Fee Proceeds). Pursuant to the terms of our terminated merger agreement with Neff, in August 2017 we received a $13.2 million breakup fee concurrently with Neff's termination of the merger agreement. Merger fees related to the proposed Neff merger totaled $6.5 million and estimated merger fees for the year ended December 31, 2017 associated with our acquisition of CEC in January 2018 totaled $0.8 million, resulting in net breakup fees of approximately $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIncome Taxes. We recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $50.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to income tax expense of approximately $21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. On December 22, 2017, the Act was signed into law. Under ASC 740, the effects of changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which the new legislation is enacted. With respect to U.S. federal income taxes, the enactment date is the date the bill becomes law (i.e. upon presidential signature). Therefore, we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 a one-time decrease in income tax expense of $66.9 million from the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the decrease in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% under the Act.\nBased on available evidence, both positive and negative, we believe it is more likely than not that our federal deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017 are fully realizable through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income, and are not subject to any limitations. However, for the year ended December 31, 2017, we increased our valuation allowance by $0.5 million for certain state net operating losses that may not be utilized.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flow from Operating Activities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the cash provided by our operating activities was $247.2 million. Our reported net income of $76.6 million, when adjusted for non-cash income and expense items, such as depreciation and amortization (including net amortization (accretion) of note discount (premium)), deferred income taxes, provision for losses on accounts receivable, provision for inventory obsolescence, stock-based compensation expense and net gains on the sale of long-lived assets, provided positive cash flows of $302.9 million. These cash flows from operating activities were also positively impacted by a $7.0 increase in accounts payable and a $2.8 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities. Additionally, manufacturing flooring plans payable and deferred compensation increased $1.7 million and $0.1 million, respectfully. Partially offsetting these positive cash flows were a $48.2 million increase in inventories and a $17.8 million increase in receivables. Also, prepaid expenses and other assets increased $1.0 million and dividends payable increased $0.2 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the cash provided by our operating activities was $226.2 million. Our reported net income of $109.7 million, when adjusted for non-cash income and expense items, such as depreciation and amortization, (including net amortization (accretion) of note discount (premium)), deferred income taxes, provision for losses on accounts receivable, provision for inventory obsolescence, stock-based compensation expense and net gains on the sale of long-lived assets, provided positive cash flows of $249.8 million. These cash flows from operating activities were also positively impacted by a $50.3 increase in accounts payable and an $8.2 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities. Partially offsetting these positive cash flows were a $40.0 million increase in receivables, a $31.8 million increase in inventories, an $8.8 million decrease in manufacturing flooring plans payable and a $1.7 million increase in prepared expenses and other assets.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our cash provided by our investing activities was exceeded by our cash used in our investing activities, resulting in net cash used in our investing activities of approximately $526.2 million. The acquisitions of CEC and Rental Inc. totaled approximately $196.0 million (net of cash acquired)and purchases of rental and non-rental equipment totaled approximately $451.6 million, which were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of rental and non-rental equipment of approximately $121.3 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by our investing activities was exceeded by cash used in our investing activities, resulting in net cash used in our investing activities of approximately $153.1 million. This was a result of purchases of rental and non-rental equipment totaling $256.7 million, which was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of rental and non-rental equipment of approximately $103.6 million.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, cash provided by our financing activities was $129.8 million. Net borrowings under our Credit Facility for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $170.8 million, which was partially offset by dividends paid totaling $39.3 million, or $1.10 per common share, treasury stock purchases totaling approximately $1.4 million, payments on capital lease obligations of $0.2 million and payments of deferred financing costs of $0.1 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the cash provided by our financing activities was approximately $85.1 million. Dividends totaling approximately $39.2 million, or $1.10 per common share, were paid during the year ended December 31, 2017. Net payments under the Credit Facility were $162.6 million. Payments on capital lease obligations were $0.2 million. Purchases of treasury stock were $0.8 million. In connection with the redemption of our Old Notes, we paid $653.3 million, representing aggregate principal payments of $630.0 million and tender and redemption premiums totaling approximately $23.3 million. In connection with the issuance of our New Notes and Add-on Notes, we received net proceeds of $958.5 million. Deferred financing costs paid in connection with the New Notes and Add-on Notes as well as the Credit Facility totaled $17.3 million.\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nOn August 24, 2017, we completed an offering of $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.6250% senior notes due 2025 (the New Notes\u201d) and the settlement of a cash tender offer (the Tender Offer\u201d) with respect to our 7% senior notes due 2022 (the Old Notes\u201d). Net proceeds, after deducting $10.3 million of estimated offering expenses, from the sale of the New Notes totaled approximately $739.7 million. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the New Notes to repurchase $329.7 million of aggregate principal amount of the Old Notes in early settlement of the Tender Offer, which the Company launched on August 17, 2017. Holders who tendered their Old Notes prior to the early tender deadline received $1,038.90 per $1,000 principal amount of Old Notes tendered, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the payment date of August 24, 2017. Effective as of August 24, 2017, we (i) provided notice of the redemption of all remaining Old Notes that were not validly tendered in the Tender Offer at the expiration time and (ii) satisfied and discharged the indenture governing the Old Notes in accordance with its terms. On September 25, 2017, we redeemed the remaining $300.3 million principal amount outstanding of the Old Notes at a redemption price equal to 103.50% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the date of redemption.\nThe New Notes were issued at par and require semiannual interest payments on March 1st and September 1st of each year, commencing on March 1, 2018. No principal payments are due until maturity (September 1, 2025).\nThe New Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time on or after September 1, 2020 at specified redemption prices plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. We may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the New Notes before September 1, 2020 with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings. We may also redeem the New Notes prior to September 1, 2020 at a specified make-whole\u201d redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.\nThe New Notes rank equally in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness and rank senior to any of our subordinated indebtedness. The New Notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by all of our current and future significant domestic restricted subsidiaries. In addition, the New Notes are effectively subordinated to all of our and the guarantors' existing and future secured indebtedness, including the Credit Facility, to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness, and are structurally subordinated to all of the liabilities and preferred stock of any of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the New Notes.\nIf we experience a change of control, we will be required to offer to purchase the New Notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase.\nThe indenture governing the New Notes contains certain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to: (i) incur additional indebtedness, assume a guarantee or issue preferred stock; (ii) pay dividends or make other equity distributions or payments to or affecting our subsidiaries; (iii) purchase or redeem our capital stock; (iv) make certain investments; (v) create liens; (vi) sell or dispose of assets or engage in mergers or consolidations; (vii) engage in certain transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates; (viii) enter into sale-leaseback transactions; and (ix) engage in certain business activities. Each of the covenants is subject to exceptions and qualifications. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with these covenants.\nOn November 22, 2017, we closed on an offering of $200 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior notes due 2025 (the Add-on Notes\u201d) in an unregistered offering through a private placement. The Add-on Notes were priced at 104.25% of the principal amount. Net proceeds from the offering of the Add-on Notes, including accrued interest from August 24, 2017 totaled approximately $209.2 million. The net proceeds of the offering, was used to repay indebtedness outstanding under the Company's existing senior secured credit facility (the Credit Facility\u201d) and for the payment of fees and expenses related to the offering. The remainder of the net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes and to fund potential acquisitions in connection with our ongoing strategy of acquiring rental companies to complement our existing business and footprint.\nThe Add-on Notes were issued as additional notes under an indenture dated as of August 24, 2017, pursuant to which we previously issued the New Notes as described above. The Add-on Notes have identical terms to, rank equally with and form a part of a single class of securities with the New Notes.\nPursuant to registration rights agreements entered into among us, the guarantors of the New Notes and the Add-On Notes, respectively, and the initial purchasers of the New Notes and the Add-On Notes, respectively, we agreed to make offers to exchange (collectively, the Exchange Offer\u201d) the New Notes and Add-On Notes and the respective guarantees for registered, publicly tradable notes and guarantees that have terms identical in all material respects to the New Notes and the Add-On Notes, respectively (except that the exchange notes do not contain any transfer restrictions) within a certain period of time following the completion of the respective note offerings. We completed the Exchange Offer for the New Notes and the Add-On Notes in March 2018.\nSenior Secured Credit Facility\nWe and our subsidiaries are parties to a $750.0 million Credit Facility with Wells Fargo Capital Finance, LLC (as successor to General Electric Company, successor-by-merger to General Electric Capital Corporation Capital Corporation) as Agent, and the lenders named therein.\nOn December 22, 2017, we amended, extended and restated the Credit Facility by entering into the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\u201d) by and among the Company, Great Northern Equipment, Inc., H&E Equipment Services (California), LLC, H&E Equipment Services (Mid-Atlantic), LLC, the other credit parties named therein, the lenders named therein, Wells Fargo Capital Finance, LLC, as administrative agent, the other credit parties named therein, the lenders named therein, and the joint lead arrangers, joint book runners, co-syndication agents and documentation agent named therein.\nThe Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, among other things, (i) extended the maturity date of the credit facility from May 21, 2019 to December 22, 2022, (ii) increased the commitments under the senior secured asset based revolver provided for therein from $602.5 million to $750 million, (iii) increased the uncommitted incremental revolving capacity from $150 million to $250 million, (iv) provided that the unused line fee margin will be either 0.375% or 0.25%, depending on the Average Revolver Usage (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) of the borrowers, (v) lowered the interest rate (a) in the case of base rate revolving loans, to the base rate plus an applicable margin of 0.50% to 1.00% depending on the Average Availability (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) and (b) in the case of LIBOR revolving loans, to LIBOR (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin of 1.50% to 2.00%, depending on the Average Availability, (vi) lowered the margin applicable to the letter of credit fee to between 1.50% and 2.00%, depending on the Average Availability, and (vii) permitted, subject to certain conditions, an unlimited amount of Permitted Acquisitions, Restricted Payments and prepayments of Indebtedness (in each case, as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement).\nOn February 1, 2019, we further amended and extended the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with the First Amendment to the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the First Amendment\u201d) by and among the Company, Great Northern Equipment, Inc., H&E Equipment Services (California), LLC, H&E Equipment Services (Mid-Atlantic), LLC, the other credit parties named therein, the lenders named therein, Wells Fargo Capital Finance, LLC, as administrative agent, the other credit parties named therein, the lenders named therein, and the joint lead arrangers, joint book runners, co-syndication agents and documentation agent named therein.\nThe First Amendment, among other things, (i) extends the maturity date of the credit facility from December 22, 2022 to February 1, 2024, and (ii) lowers the interest rate in the case of LIBOR revolving loans, to LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 1.25% to 1.75%, depending on the Average Availability and (iii) lowers the interest rate in the case of Base Rate loans, to the Base Rate (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin of 0.25% to 0.75%, depending on the Average Availability.\nThe Amended and Restated Credit Agreement continues to provide for, among other things, a $30 million letter of credit sub-facility, and a guaranty by certain of the Company's subsidiaries of the obligations under the Credit Facility. In addition, the Credit Facility remains secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had total borrowings under the Credit Facility of $170.8 million and we could borrow up to $571.5 million and remain in compliance with the debt covenants under the Company's credit facility. At February 14, 2019, we had $483.3 million of available borrowings under our Credit Facility, net of a $7.7 million outstanding letter of credit.\nCash Requirements Related to Operations\nOur principal sources of liquidity have been from cash provided by operating activities and the sales of new, used and rental fleet equipment, proceeds from the issuance of debt, and borrowings available under the Credit Facility. Our principal uses of cash have been to fund operating activities and working capital (including new and used equipment inventories), purchases of rental fleet equipment and property and equipment, fund payments due under facility operating leases and manufacturer flooring plans payable, fund acquisitions and to meet debt service requirements. In the future, we may pursue additional strategic acquisitions and seek to open new start-up locations. We anticipate that the above described uses will be the principal demands on our cash in the future.\nThe amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including general economic conditions and growth prospects. Our gross rental fleet capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2018 were approximately $440.9 million, including $24.3 million of non-cash transfers from new and used equipment to rental fleet inventory. Our gross property and equipment capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $35.0 million. In response to changing economic conditions, we believe we have the flexibility to modify our capital expenditures by adjusting them (either up or down) to match our actual performance.\nTo service our debt, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness (including the New Notes and the Add-on Notes, the Credit Facility and our other indebtedness), will depend upon our future operating performance and the availability of borrowings under the Credit Facility and/or other debt and equity financing alternatives available to us, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and conditions in the global credit and capital markets, as well as financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Based on our current level of operations and given the current state of the capital markets, we believe our cash flow from operations, available cash and available borrowings under the Credit Facility will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. As of February 14, 2019, we had $483.3 million of available borrowings under the Credit Facility, net of a $7.7 million outstanding letter of credit.\nWe cannot provide absolute assurance that our future cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our long-term obligations and commitments. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities in the future to service our indebtedness and to meet our other commitments, we will be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness, selling material assets or operations or seeking to raise additional debt or equity capital. Given current economic and market conditions, including the significant disruptions in the global capital markets, we cannot assure investors that any of these actions could be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms or at all, or that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements. In addition, our existing debt agreements, including the Credit Facility and the indenture governing the New Notes and the Add-on Notes, as well as any future debt agreements, contain or may contain restrictive covenants, which may prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt.\nQuarterly Dividend\nOn each of February 16, 2018, May 16, 2018, August 8, 2018 and November 7, 2018, the Company announced a quarterly dividend of $0.275 per share to stockholders of record, which were paid on March 9, 2018, June 15 2018, September 7, 2018 and December 7, 2018, respectively, totaling approximately $39.3 million. On February 8, 2019, the Company announced a quarterly dividend of $0.275 per share to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 20, 2019, which is to be paid on March 8, 2019.\nThe Company intends to continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends; however, the declaration of any subsequent dividends is discretionary and will be subject to a final determination by the Board of Directors each quarter after its review of, among other things, business and market conditions.\nSeasonality\nAlthough we believe our business is not materially impacted by seasonality, the demand for our rental equipment tends to be lower in the winter months. The level of equipment rental activities is directly related to commercial and industrial construction and maintenance activities. Therefore, equipment rental performance will be correlated to the levels of current construction activities. The severity of weather conditions can have a temporary impact on the level of construction activities. Adverse weather has a seasonal impact in parts of the markets we serve, including our Intermountain region, particularly in the winter months.\nEquipment sales cycles are also subject to some seasonality with the peak selling period during the spring season and extending through the summer. Parts and services activities are typically less affected by changes in demand caused by seasonality.\nCertain Information Concerning Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAn off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with the Company.\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements as described above. Further, we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.

We intend to continue to evaluate and pursue, on an opportunistic basis, acquisitions which meet our selection criteria, and we are focused on identifying and acquiring rental companies to complement our existing business, broaden our geographic footprint, and increase our density in existing markets.\nEffective January 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Contractors Equipment Center, a privately-held company focused on non-residential construction equipment rentals serving the greater Denver, Colorado area out of three branch locations. Effective April 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Rental, Inc., an equipment rental and distribution company with five branch locations in Alabama and Florida. Effective February 1, 2019, we completed the acquisition of We-Rent-It, an equipment rental company with six branch locations in Central Texas.\nThe success of our growth strategy depends, in part, on selecting strategic acquisition candidates at attractive prices and identifying strategic start-up locations. We expect to face competition for acquisition candidates, which may limit the number of acquisition opportunities and lead to higher acquisition costs. We may not have the financial resources necessary to consummate any acquisitions or to successfully open any new facilities in the future or the ability to obtain the necessary funds on satisfactory terms. For further information regarding our risks related to acquisitions, see Item 1A - Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "New Equipment Sales. We seek to optimize revenues from new equipment sales by selling equipment through a professional in-house retail sales force focused by product type. While sales of new equipment are impacted by the availability of equipment from the manufacturer, we believe our status as a leading distributor for some of our key suppliers improves our ability to obtain equipment. New equipment sales are an important component of our integrated model due to customer interaction and service contact and new equipment sales also lead to future parts and services revenues.\nOur largest expenses are the costs to purchase the new equipment we sell, the costs associated with the used equipment we sell, rental expenses, rental depreciation and costs associated with parts sales and services, all of which are included in cost of revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our total cost of revenues was approximately $800.4 million. Our operating expenses consist principally of selling, general and administrative expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our selling, general and administrative expenses were $278.3 million. In addition, we have interest expense related to our debt instruments.

Our principal uses of cash have been to fund operating activities and working capital (including new and used equipment inventories), purchases of rental fleet equipment and property and equipment, fund payments due under facility operating leases and manufacturer flooring plans payable, fund acquisitions and to meet debt service requirements. In the future, we may pursue additional strategic acquisitions and seek to open new start-up locations.

Our work force includes distinct, focused sales forces for our new and used equipment sales and rental operations, highly skilled service technicians, product specialists and regional managers. We focus our sales and rental activities on, and organize our personnel principally by, our four core equipment categories. We believe this allows us to provide specialized equipment knowledge, improve the effectiveness of our rental and sales force and strengthen our customer relationships. In addition, we have branch managers for each location who are responsible for managing their assets and financial results. We believe this fosters accountability in our business and strengthens our local and regional relationships.\nUsed Equipment Sales. We generate the majority of our used equipment sales revenues by selling equipment from our rental fleet. The remainder of our used equipment sales revenues comes from the sale of inventoried equipment that we acquire through trade-ins from our equipment customers and selective purchases of high-quality used equipment. Our policy is not to offer specified price trade-in arrangements on equipment for sale. Sales of our rental fleet equipment allow us to manage the size, quality, composition and age of our rental fleet, and provide us with a profitable distribution channel for the disposal of rental equipment.\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total Dollar\nChange\nIncrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage Change Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equipment rentals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 592,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 479,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 113,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> New equipment sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 262,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 203,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Used equipment sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 125,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 107,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Parts sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 120,454\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 114,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Services revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 62,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-Segmented other revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,238,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,030,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 208,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAlthough we believe our business is not materially impacted by seasonality, the demand for our rental equipment tends to be lower in the winter months. The level of equipment rental activities is directly related to commercial and industrial construction and maintenance activities. Therefore, equipment rental performance will be correlated to the levels of current construction activities. The severity of weather conditions can have a temporary impact on the level of construction activities. Adverse weather has a seasonal impact in parts of the markets we serve, including our Intermountain region, particularly in the winter months.\nOur selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses include sales and marketing expenses, payroll and related benefit costs, including stock compensation expense, insurance expenses, legal and professional fees, rent and other occupancy costs, property and other taxes, administrative overhead, depreciation associated with property and equipment (other than rental equipment) and amortization expense associated with intangible assets. These expenses are not generally allocated to our reportable segments.\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total Dollar\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment Gross Profit (Loss):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equipment rentals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 231,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 211,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> New equipment sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Used equipment sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Parts sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (544\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Services revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,762\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,072\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-Segmented revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (623\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,307\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (52.3\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 359,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 335,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs one of the largest integrated equipment services companies in the United States focused on heavy construction and industrial equipment, we rent, sell and provide parts and services support for four core categories of specialized equipment: (1) hi-lift or aerial work platform equipment; (2) cranes; (3) earthmoving equipment; and (4) industrial lift trucks. By providing equipment rental, sales, on-site parts, repair and maintenance functions under one roof, we are a one-stop provider for our customers' varied equipment needs.

Interest expense also includes interest on our outstanding manufacturer flooring plans payable which are used to finance inventory and rental equipment purchases. Non-cash interest expense related to the amortization cost of deferred financing costs and the accretion/amortization of note discount/premium are also included in interest expense.\nReserves for Claims. We are exposed to various claims relating to our business, including those for which we provide self-insurance. Claims for which we self-insure up to specified retention limits include: (1) workers compensation claims; (2) general liability claims by third parties for injury or property damage caused by our equipment or personnel; (3) automobile liability claims; and (4) employee health insurance claims. These types of claims may take a substantial amount of time to resolve and, accordingly, the ultimate liability associated with a particular claim, including claims incurred but not reported as of a period-end reporting date, may not be known for an extended period of time. Our methodology for developing self-insurance reserves is based on management estimates and independent third party actuarial estimates. Our estimation process considers, among other matters, the cost of known claims over time, cost inflation and incurred but not reported claims. These estimates may change based on, among other things, changes in our claim history or receipt of additional information relevant to assessing the claims. Further, these estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as adverse judicial determinations or other claim settlements at higher than estimated amounts. Accordingly, we may be required to increase or decrease our reserve levels.\n \u2022 New Equipment Sales. Our new equipment sales operation sells new equipment in all of our four core product categories. We have a retail sales force focused by equipment type that is separate from our rental sales force. Manufacturer purchase terms and pricing are managed by our product specialists. \nWith the exception of goodwill, long-lived fixed assets generally represent the largest component of our acquisitions. Typically, the long-lived fixed assets that we acquire are primarily comprised of rental fleet equipment. Historically, virtually all of the rental equipment that we have acquired through business combinations have been classified as To be Used,\u201d rather than as To be Sold.\u201d Equipment that we acquire and classify as To be Used\u201d is recorded at fair value. Any significant inventories of new and used equipment acquired in the transaction are valued at fair value, which should approximate a market participant's estimated selling price adjusted for (1) costs in the selling effort and (2) a reasonable profit allowance.\nThe Add-on Notes were issued as additional notes under an indenture dated as of August 24, 2017, pursuant to which we previously issued the New Notes as described above. The Add-on Notes have identical terms to, rank equally with and form a part of a single class of securities with the New Notes.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the cash provided by our financing activities was approximately $85.1 million. Dividends totaling approximately $39.2 million, or $1.10 per common share, were paid during the year ended December 31, 2017. Net payments under the Credit Facility were $162.6 million. Payments on capital lease obligations were $0.2 million. Purchases of treasury stock were $0.8 million. In connection with the redemption of our Old Notes, we paid $653.3 million, representing aggregate principal payments of $630.0 million and tender and redemption premiums totaling approximately $23.3 million. In connection with the issuance of our New Notes and Add-on Notes, we received net proceeds of $958.5 million. Deferred financing costs paid in connection with the New Notes and Add-on Notes as well as the Credit Facility totaled $17.3 million.\nCash Flow from Operating Activities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the cash provided by our operating activities was $247.2 million. Our reported net income of $76.6 million, when adjusted for non-cash income and expense items, such as depreciation and amortization (including net amortization (accretion) of note discount (premium)), deferred income taxes, provision for losses on accounts receivable, provision for inventory obsolescence, stock-based compensation expense and net gains on the sale of long-lived assets, provided positive cash flows of $302.9 million. These cash flows from operating activities were also positively impacted by a $7.0 increase in accounts payable and a $2.8 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities. Additionally, manufacturing flooring plans payable and deferred compensation increased $1.7 million and $0.1 million, respectfully. Partially offsetting these positive cash flows were a $48.2 million increase in inventories and a $17.8 million increase in receivables. Also, prepaid expenses and other assets increased $1.0 million and dividends payable increased $0.2 million.\nUsed Equipment Sales Revenues. Our used equipment sales increased $10.4 million, or 10.8%, to $107.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $96.9 million for the same period in 2016. Sales of used earthmoving equipment increased $5.4 million and sales of used cranes increased $3.1 million. Sales of used other equipment increased $1.2 million, while sales of used lift trucks and used aerial work platform equipment increased $0.5 million and $0.2 million, respectively.\nNew Equipment Sales. Cost of new equipment sold primarily consists of the equipment cost of the new equipment that is sold, net of any amount of credit given to the customer towards the equipment for trade-ins.\nWe generate all of our total revenues from our five business segments and our non-segmented equipment support activities. Equipment rentals and new equipment sales account for more than half of our total revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 47.8% of our total revenues were attributable to equipment rentals, 21.3% of our total revenues were attributable to new equipment sales, 10.1% were attributable to used equipment sales, 9.7% were attributable to parts sales, 5.1% were attributable to our services revenues and 6.0% were attributable to non-segmented other revenues.\nParts Sales Gross Profit. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our parts sales revenue gross profit increased $1.1 million, or 3.4%, to $32.2 million from $31.1 million for the same period in 2017 on a $6.2 million increase in parts sales revenues. Gross profit margin on parts sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 26.7%, a decrease of 0.5% from 27.2% in the same period in 2017, as a result of the mix of parts sold.\nThe amount of depreciation expense we record is highly dependent upon the estimated useful lives and the salvage values assigned to each category of rental equipment. Generally, we assign estimated useful lives to our rental fleet ranging from a three-year life, five-year life with a 25% salvage value, seven-year life and a ten-year life. Depreciation expense on our rental fleet for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $208.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the estimated impact of a change in estimated useful lives for each category of equipment by two years was as follows:\nThe increase in equipment rentals gross profit was the result of a $113.2 million increase in equipment rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to last year, which was partially offset by a $38.9 million increase in rental equipment depreciation expense and an $11.9 million increase in rental expenses. The increases in both depreciation expense and rental expenses are primarily due to a larger fleet size in 2018 compared to 2017.\n</td> </tr>\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td>\nOur deferred tax calculation requires management to make certain estimates about future operations. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the cash provided by our operating activities was $226.2 million. Our reported net income of $109.7 million, when adjusted for non-cash income and expense items, such as depreciation and amortization, (including net amortization (accretion) of note discount (premium)), deferred income taxes, provision for losses on accounts receivable, provision for inventory obsolescence, stock-based compensation expense and net gains on the sale of long-lived assets, provided positive cash flows of $249.8 million. These cash flows from operating activities were also positively impacted by a $50.3 increase in accounts payable and an $8.2 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities. Partially offsetting these positive cash flows were a $40.0 million increase in receivables, a $31.8 million increase in inventories, an $8.8 million decrease in manufacturing flooring plans payable and a $1.7 million increase in prepared expenses and other assets.\n (4) This includes total minimum operating lease rental payments having initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms longer than one year. \nEquipment Rental Revenues. Our revenues from equipment rentals for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $113.2 million, or 23.6%, to $592.2 million from $479.0 million in 2017. The increase in equipment rental revenues was largely due to increased demand and the equipment rental revenues from our CEC and Rental Inc. locations.\nSales of new cranes increased $44.3 million, resulting from improved crane demand. Sales of new aerial work platform equipment increased $13.8 million. Sales of new lift trucks and new earthmoving equipment increased $1.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively. Partially offsetting these increases in new equipment sales was a $3.3 million decrease in new other equipment sales. The product line new equipment sales revenue fluctuations above do not include the impact of legacy CEC and Rental Inc. new equipment sales revenues by product line for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, respectively.\n\nOther revenues: Other revenues relate primarily to hauling fees for transporting rental equipment and equipment sold to and from the customer and ancillary charges associated with equipment maintenance and repair services. Such revenues are recognized at the time the services are performed.\nRental revenues from aerial work platform equipment increased $66.7 million and earthmoving equipment rental revenues increased $24.3 million, while rental revenues from other equipment and lift trucks increased $8.5 million and $3.0 million, respectively. Partially offsetting these increases in equipment rental revenues was a $1.1 million decrease in crane rental revenues. The product line equipment rental revenue fluctuations above do not include the impact of legacy CEC and Rental Inc. equipment rental revenues by product line for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, respectively.\nThrough our predecessor companies, we have been in the equipment services business for approximately 58 years. H&E Equipment Services L.L.C. ( H&E LLC\u201d) was formed in June 2002 through the business combination of Head & Engquist Equipment, LLC ( Head & Engquist\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gulf Wide Industries, L.L.C. ( Gulf Wide\u201d), and ICM Equipment Company L.L.C. ( ICM\u201d). Head & Engquist, founded in 1961, and ICM, founded in 1971, were two leading regional, integrated equipment service companies operating in contiguous geographic markets. In the June 2002 transaction, Head & Engquist and ICM were merged with and into Gulf Wide, which was renamed H&E LLC. Prior to the combination, Head & Engquist operated 25 facilities in the Gulf Coast region, and ICM operated 16 facilities in the Intermountain region of the United States.\nNew Equipment Sales Revenues. Our new equipment sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $6.6 million, or 3.4%, to $203.3 million from $196.7 million in 2016, as new crane sales increased $11.8 million. Sales of new other equipment increased $7.1 million and sales of new aerial work platform equipment increased $3.3 million. Partially offsetting these increases in new equipment sales were a $15.3 million decrease in new earthmoving equipment sales and a $0.3 million decrease in new lift truck sales.\nRental revenues: An insignificant portion of our total equipment rental revenues are recognized pursuant to Topic 606 rather than pursuant to Topic 840. These revenues represent services performed by us in connection with the rental of equipment and are comprised of customer training fees on rented equipment and erection and dismantling services on rental equipment. Revenues for these services are recognized upon completion of such services. See discussion below regarding rental revenues recognized pursuant to Topic 840.\nIf we experience a change of control, we will be required to offer to purchase the New Notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase.\nRevenue Sources\nBased on available evidence, both positive and negative, we believe it is more likely than not that our federal deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017 are fully realizable through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income, and are not subject to any limitations. However, for the year ended December 31, 2017, we increased our valuation allowance by $0.5 million for certain state net operating losses that may not be utilized.\nEquipment Rental Revenues. Our revenues from equipment rentals for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $33.8 million, or 7.6%, to $479.0 million from $445.2 million in 2016. Rental revenues from aerial work platform equipment increased $30.7 million and earthmoving equipment rental revenues increased $5.5 million, while rental revenues from other equipment and lift trucks increased $2.8 million and $0.5 million, respectively. Partially offsetting these increases in equipment rental revenues was a $5.7 million decrease in crane rental revenues. Our average rental rates for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 0.2% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe rental equipment mix among our four core product lines for the year ended December 31, 2018 was largely consistent with that of the prior year comparable period as a percentage of total units available for rent and as a percentage of original acquisition cost.\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nUsed Equipment Sales Gross Profit. Our used equipment sales gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $3.0 million, or 10.0%, to $33.2 million from $30.2 million in the same period in 2016 on an increase in used equipment sales of $10.4 million. Gross profit margin on used equipment sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 30.9%, down 0.2% from 31.1% for the same period in 2016, primarily as a result of the mix of used equipment sold. Our used equipment sales from the rental fleet, which comprised approximately 89.7% and 87.1% of our used equipment sales for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, were approximately 149.6% and 152.4% of net book value for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nParts sales: Revenues from the sales of equipment parts are recognized at the time of pick-up by the customer for parts counter sales transactions. For parts that are shipped to a customer, we elected to use a practical expedient of Topic 606 and treat such shipping activities as fulfillment costs, thereby recognizing revenues at the time of shipment.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had total borrowings under the Credit Facility of $170.8 million and we could borrow up to $571.5 million and remain in compliance with the debt covenants under the Company's credit facility. At February 14, 2019, we had $483.3 million of available borrowings under our Credit Facility, net of a $7.7 million outstanding letter of credit.\nInflation\nIn accordance with ASC 740, the Company recognizes the effect of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not (a likelihood of greater than 50%) that such position will be sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company recognizes both interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in net other income (expense).\n\nTotal Revenues. Our total revenues were $1.03 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to approximately $978.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $51.9 million, or 5.3%. Revenues for our reportable segments and non-segmented other revenues are further discussed below.\nIn addition to long-lived fixed assets, we also acquire other assets and assume liabilities. These other assets and liabilities typically include, but are not limited to, parts inventory, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other working capital items. Because of their short-term nature, the fair values of these assets and liabilities generally approximate the carrying values reflected on the acquired entities balance sheets. However, when appropriate, we adjust these carrying values for factors such as collectibility and existence. The intangible assets that we have acquired generally consist primarily of the goodwill recognized. Depending upon the applicable purchase agreement and the particular facts and circumstances of the business acquired, we may identify other intangible assets, such as trade names or trademarks, non-compete agreements and customer-related intangibles (specifically, customer relationships). A trademark has a fair value equal to the present value of the royalty income attributable to it. The royalty income attributable to a trademark represents the hypothetical cost savings that are derived from owning the trademark instead of paying royalties to license the trademark from another owner. When specifically negotiated by the parties in the applicable purchase\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts that reflects our estimate of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect. We develop our estimate of this allowance based on our historical experience with specific customers, our understanding of our current economic circumstances and our own judgment as to the likelihood of ultimate payment. Our largest exposure to doubtful accounts is in our rental operations. We perform credit evaluations of customers and establish credit limits based on reviews of our customers' current credit information and payment histories. We believe our credit risk is somewhat mitigated by our geographically diverse customer base and our credit evaluation procedures. During the year, we write-off customer account balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote. Such write-offs are charged against our allowance for doubtful accounts. Bad debt expense as a percentage of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were approximately 0.2%, 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively. The actual rate of future credit losses, however, may not be similar to past experience. Our estimate of doubtful accounts could change based on changing circumstances, including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers. Accordingly, we may be required to increase or decrease our allowance for doubtful accounts. See also Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements regarding pending a pending accounting pronouncement related to estimating credit losses.\nNew Equipment Sales Gross Profit. Our new equipment sales gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $8.3 million, or 36.7%, to $30.9 million compared to $22.6 million in 2017 on an increase in total new equipment sales of $59.6 million. Gross profit margin on new equipment sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately 11.7%, an increase of 0.6% from 11.1% in 2017, as a result of higher new crane and aerial work platform sales gross margins and the mix of new equipment sold.\n\nWe cannot provide absolute assurance that our future cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our long-term obligations and commitments. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities in the future to service our indebtedness and to meet our other commitments, we will be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness, selling material assets or operations or seeking to raise additional debt or equity capital. Given current economic and market conditions, including the significant disruptions in the global capital markets, we cannot assure investors that any of these actions could be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms or at all, or that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements. In addition, our existing debt agreements, including the Credit Facility and the indenture governing the New Notes and the Add-on Notes, as well as any future debt agreements, contain or may contain restrictive covenants, which may prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt.\nServices Revenues. Our services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $0.6 million, or 1.0%, to $63.5 million from $62.9 million in the same period last year. The increase in services revenues was primarily due to services revenues from our CEC and Rental Inc. locations.\n \u2022 Adverse weather. Adverse weather in a geographic region in which we operate may depress demand for equipment in that region. Our equipment is primarily used outdoors and, as a result, prolonged adverse weather conditions may prohibit our customers from continuing their work projects. Adverse weather also has a seasonal impact in parts of our Intermountain region, particularly in the winter months. \n</table>\nMerger Costs (net of Merger Breakup Fee Proceeds). Pursuant to the terms of our terminated 2017 merger agreement with Neff Corporation ( Neff\u201d), we received a $13.2 million breakup fee concurrently with Neff's termination of the merger agreement in the third quarter of 2017. Related estimated merger transaction fees related to Neff and other acquisition-related activity for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $6.7 million, resulting in estimated net proceeds of $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nItem 7.\nWe are also subject to federal and state income taxes. Future income tax examinations by state and federal agencies could result in additional income tax expense based on probable outcomes of such matters.\nUsed equipment sales: Revenues from the sales of used equipment are recognized at the time of delivery to, or pick-up by, the customer, which is when the customer obtains control of the promised good.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, cash provided by our financing activities was $129.8 million. Net borrowings under our Credit Facility for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $170.8 million, which was partially offset by dividends paid totaling $39.3 million, or $1.10 per common share, treasury stock purchases totaling approximately $1.4 million, payments on capital lease obligations of $0.2 million and payments of deferred financing costs of $0.1 million.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. As more fully described in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we recorded a one-time loss on the early extinguishment of debt in the year ended December 31, 2017 of approximately $25.4 million, reflecting payment of $12.8 million of tender premiums associated with our repurchase of the Old Notes and $10.5 million of premiums in accordance with the indenture governing the Old Notes to redeem the remaining untendered Old Notes, combined with the write off of approximately $2.0 million of unamortized note premium, unaccreted note discount and unamortized deferred financing costs, in each case, related to the Old Notes.\nThe 2017 income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was the result of the Act being signed into law on December 22, 2017. Under ASC 740, the effects of changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which the new legislation is enacted. With respect to U.S. federal income taxes, the enactment date is the date the bill becomes law (i.e. upon presidential signature). Therefore, we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 a one-time decrease in income tax expense of $66.9 million from the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the decrease in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% under the Act. Our accounting for the income tax effects of the Act has been completed.\nParts Sales Gross Profit. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our parts sales revenue gross profit decreased $0.5 million, or 1.7%, to $29.7 million from $30.2 million for the same period in 2016 on a $1.8 million decrease in parts sales revenues. Gross profit margin on parts sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 27.6%, a decrease of 0.1% from 27.7% in the same period in 2016, as a result of the mix of parts sold.\nParts Sales. Cost of parts sales represents costs attributable to the sale of parts directly to customers.\nAlthough we cannot accurately anticipate the effect of inflation on our operations, we believe that inflation has not had for the three most recent fiscal years ended, and is not likely in the foreseeable future to have, a material impact on our results of operations.\nUseful Lives of Rental Equipment and Property and Equipment. We depreciate rental equipment and property and equipment over their estimated useful lives (generally three to ten years), after giving effect to an estimated salvage value ranging from 0% to 25% of cost. The useful life of rental equipment is determined based on our estimate of the period the asset will generate revenues, and the salvage value is determined based on our estimate of the minimum value we could realize from the asset after such period. We periodically review the assumptions utilized in computing rates of depreciation. We may be required to change these estimates based on changes in our industry or other changing circumstances. If these estimates change in the future, we may be required to recognize increased or decreased depreciation expense for these assets.\n (1) Future interest payments are calculated based on the assumption that all debt remains outstanding until maturity. Interest on the Credit Facility assumes the interest rate in effect at December 31, 2018 and includes unused commitment fees. \nEffective January 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Contractors Equipment Center, a privately-held company focused on non-residential construction equipment rentals serving the greater Denver, Colorado area out of three branch locations. Effective April 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Rental, Inc., an equipment rental and distribution company with five branch locations in Alabama and Florida. Effective February 1, 2019, we completed the acquisition of We-Rent-It, an equipment rental company with six branch locations in Central Texas.\nTotal Revenues. Our total revenues were $1.24 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $1.03 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $208.9 million, or 20.3%. Revenues increased for all of our reportable segments and non-segmented other revenues and are further discussed below.\nSenior Secured Credit Facility\nPurchase Price Allocation. We have made significant acquisitions in the past and we intend to make additional acquisitions in the future that meet our selection criteria that solidify our presence in the contiguous regions where we operate with an objective of increasing our revenues, improving our profitability, entering additional attractive markets and strengthening our competitive position. Pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 350 ( ASC 350\u201d), Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, we record as goodwill the excess of the consideration transferred plus the fair value of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired. Such fair market value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by various factors over time, which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates.\nPursuant to registration rights agreements entered into among us, the guarantors of the New Notes and the Add-On Notes, respectively, and the initial purchasers of the New Notes and the Add-On Notes, respectively, we agreed to make offers to exchange (collectively, the Exchange Offer\u201d) the New Notes and Add-On Notes and the respective guarantees for registered, publicly tradable notes and guarantees that have terms identical in all material respects to the New Notes and the Add-On Notes, respectively (except that the exchange notes do not contain any transfer restrictions) within a certain period of time following the completion of the respective note offerings. We completed the Exchange Offer for the New Notes and the Add-On Notes in March 2018.\nTotal Gross Profit. Our total gross profit was $438.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $359.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $78.6 million, or 21.8%. Total gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately 35.4%, an increase of 0.5% from the 34.9% gross profit margin for the same period in 2017. Gross profit and gross margin for all reportable segments and non-segmented other revenues are further described below.\nNew Equipment Sales Revenues. Our new equipment sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $59.6 million, or 29.3%, to $262.9 million from $203.3 million in 2017. This increase, as noted below, was driven primarily by increased sales of new cranes and aerial work platform equipment, combined with the new equipment sales revenues from our Rental Inc. locations.\nRental Depreciation. Depreciation of rental equipment represents the depreciation costs attributable to rental equipment. Estimated useful lives vary based upon type of equipment. Generally, we depreciate cranes and aerial work platforms over a ten year estimated useful life, earthmoving over a five year estimated useful life with a 25% salvage value, and industrial lift trucks over a seven year estimated useful life. Attachments and other smaller type equipment are depreciated over a three year estimated useful life. We periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives assigned to rental equipment.\nAs a percentage of total revenues, SG&A expenses were 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 22.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of 0.1%.\nThe New Notes were issued at par and require semiannual interest payments on March 1st and September 1st of each year, commencing on March 1, 2018. No principal payments are due until maturity (September 1, 2025).\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nAs of December 31, 2018, our goodwill was comprised of the following carrying values for our six reporting units (amounts in thousands):\nWe and our subsidiaries are parties to a $750.0 million Credit Facility with Wells Fargo Capital Finance, LLC (as successor to General Electric Company, successor-by-merger to General Electric Capital Corporation Capital Corporation) as Agent, and the lenders named therein.\nTo service our debt, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness (including the New Notes and the Add-on Notes, the Credit Facility and our other indebtedness), will depend upon our future operating performance and the availability of borrowings under the Credit Facility and/or other debt and equity financing alternatives available to us, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and conditions in the global credit and capital markets, as well as financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Based on our current level of operations and given the current state of the capital markets, we believe our cash flow from operations, available cash and available borrowings under the Credit Facility will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. As of February 14, 2019, we had $483.3 million of available borrowings under the Credit Facility, net of a $7.7 million outstanding letter of credit.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses:\nOn December 22, 2017, we amended, extended and restated the Credit Facility by entering into the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\u201d) by and among the Company, Great Northern Equipment, Inc., H&E Equipment Services (California), LLC, H&E Equipment Services (Mid-Atlantic), LLC, the other credit parties named therein, the lenders named therein, Wells Fargo Capital Finance, LLC, as administrative agent, the other credit parties named therein, the lenders named therein, and the joint lead arrangers, joint book runners, co-syndication agents and documentation agent named therein.\nDetermining the optimal age and mix for our rental fleet equipment is subjective and requires considerable estimates and judgments by management. We constantly evaluate the mix, age and quality of the equipment in our rental fleet in response to current economic and market conditions, competition and customer demand. The mix and age of our rental fleet, as well as our cash flows, are impacted by sales of equipment from the rental fleet, which are influenced by used equipment pricing at the retail and secondary auction market levels, and the capital expenditures to acquire new rental fleet equipment. In making equipment acquisition decisions, we evaluate current economic and market conditions, competition, manufacturers' availability, pricing and return on investment over the estimated useful life of the specific equipment, among other things. As a result of our in-house service capabilities and extensive maintenance program, we believe our rental fleet is well-maintained.\nBased on available evidence, both positive and negative, we believe it is more likely than not that our federal deferred tax assets at December 31, 2018 are fully realizable through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income, and are not subject to any limitations. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we decreased our valuation allowance by $0.1 million for certain state net operating losses that were utilized.\nGross Profit.\nFor purposes of the sensitivity analysis above, we elected not to decrease the useful lives of other equipment, which are primarily three-year estimated useful life assets; rather, we have held the depreciation expense constant at the actual amount of depreciation expense. We believe that decreasing the life of the other equipment by two years is an unreasonable estimate and would potentially lead to the decision to expense, rather than capitalize, a significant portion of the subject asset class. In general terms, a one-year increase in the estimated life across all classes of our rental equipment will give rise to an approximate decrease in our annual depreciation expense of approximately $27.3 million. Additionally, a one-year decrease in the estimated life across all classes of our rental equipment (with the exception of other equipment as discussed above) will give rise to an approximate increase in our annual depreciation expense of approximately $22.2 million.\n \u2022 Regional and Industry-Specific Activity and Trends. Expenditures by our customers may be impacted by the overall level of construction activity in the markets and regions in which they operate, the price of oil and other commodities and other general economic trends impacting the industries in which our customers and end users operate. As our customers adjust their activity and spending levels in response to these external factors, our rentals and sales of equipment to those customers will be impacted. For example, high levels of industrial activity in our Gulf Coast and Intermountain regions have been a meaningful driver of recent growth in our revenues. However, the decline in oil and natural gas prices and the related downturn in oil industry activities during fiscal years 2014, 2015 and 2016 resulted in a significant decrease in our new equipment sales, primarily the sale of new cranes, due to lower demand. Although oil prices have subsequently stabilized and improved in 2017 and into 2018, prices decreased significantly at the end of 2018 into early 2019 and we believe the uncertainty regarding future oil prices continues to impact customer capital expenditure decisions. \nAs of December 31, 2018, we had standby letters of credit issued under our Credit Facility totaling $7.7 million that expire in May 2019. The Company expects to renew those letters of credit under similar terms upon their expiration.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by our investing activities was exceeded by cash used in our investing activities, resulting in net cash used in our investing activities of approximately $153.1 million. This was a result of purchases of rental and non-rental equipment totaling $256.7 million, which was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of rental and non-rental equipment of approximately $103.6 million.\nDuring 2017 and 2018, we performed, as of October 1 of each respective year, a qualitative assessment and determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units is not less than its carrying value and, therefore, did not perform the prescribed two-step goodwill impairment test. We considered various factors in performing the qualitative test, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, the overall financial performance of our reporting units, the Company's stock price and the excess amount or cushion\u201d between our reporting unit's fair value and carrying value as indicated on our most recent quantitative assessment. Based upon improving macroeconomic conditions, positive trends within our industry and market and continuing positive operating results in comparison to prior periods and our internal forecasts, as well as consideration of the cushion between the reporting unit's fair value and carrying value from our prior quantitative analysis, we determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units exceeds their respective carrying values at the October 1, 2017 and 2018 valuation dates and there was no goodwill impairment at October 1, 2017 or 2018.\nWe are subject to a number of external factors that may adversely affect our businesses. These factors, and other factors, are discussed below and under the heading Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d and in Item 1A - Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAnother significant assumption used in our calculation of depreciation expense is the estimated salvage value assigned to our earthmoving equipment. Based on our recent experience, we have used a 25% factor of the equipment's original cost to estimate its salvage value. This factor is highly subjective and subject to change in the future based upon actual results at the time we dispose of the equipment. A change of 5%, either increase or decrease, in the estimated salvage value would result in a change in our annual depreciation expense of approximately $3.2 million.\nFor purposes of performing the first step of the impairment test described above, we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis and/or by applying various market multiples. The principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis are our internal projected results of operations, weighted average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d) and terminal value assumptions.\nGross Profit.\nCost of Revenues:\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. We recorded a one-time loss on the early extinguishment of debt in the three month period ended September 30, 2017 of approximately $25.4 million, reflecting payment of $12.8 million of tender premiums associated with our repurchase of the Old Notes and $10.5 million of premiums in accordance with the indenture governing the Old Notes to redeem the remaining untendered Old Notes, combined with the write off of approximately $2.0 million of unamortized note premium, unaccreted note discount and unamortized deferred financing costs, related to the Old Notes\nPrincipal Costs and Expenses\n \u2022 Used Equipment Sales. Our used equipment sales are generated primarily from sales of used equipment from our rental fleet, as well as from sales of inventoried equipment that we acquire through trade-ins from our equipment customers and through selective purchases of high quality used equipment. Used equipment is sold by our dedicated retail sales force. Our used equipment sales are an effective way for us to manage the size and composition of our rental fleet and provide a profitable distribution channel for disposal of rental equipment. \nServices revenues: We derive our services primarily from maintenance and repair services to customers for their owned equipment. We recognize services revenues at the time such services are completed, which is when the customer obtains control of the promised service.\nBackground\nThe equipment that we sell, rent and service is principally used in the construction industry, as well as by companies for commercial and industrial uses such as plant maintenance and turnarounds, as well as in the petrochemical and energy sectors. As a result, our total revenues are affected by several factors including, but not limited to, the demand for and availability of rental equipment, rental rates and other competitive factors, the demand for new and used equipment, the level of construction and industrial activities, spending levels by our customers, adverse weather conditions and general economic conditions. For a discussion of the impact of seasonality on our revenues, see Seasonality\u201d below.\nOn November 22, 2017, we closed on an offering of $200 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior notes due 2025 (the Add-on Notes\u201d) in an unregistered offering through a private placement. The Add-on Notes were priced at 104.25% of the principal amount. Net proceeds from the offering of the Add-on Notes, including accrued interest from August 24, 2017 totaled approximately $209.2 million. The net proceeds of the offering, was used to repay indebtedness outstanding under the Company's existing senior secured credit facility (the Credit Facility\u201d) and for the payment of fees and expenses related to the offering. The remainder of the net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes and to fund potential acquisitions in connection with our ongoing strategy of acquiring rental companies to complement our existing business and footprint.\nSales of used aerial work platform equipment increased $24.8 million while sales of used other equipment and used cranes increased $2.4 million and $1.5 million, respectively. Partially offsetting these increases in used equipment sales were a $9.6 million decrease in used earthmoving equipment sales and a $1.8 million decrease in used lift truck sales. The product line used equipment sales revenue fluctuations above do not include the impact of legacy CEC and Rental Inc. used equipment sales revenues by product line for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, respectively.\nThe First Amendment, among other things, (i) extends the maturity date of the credit facility from December 22, 2022 to February 1, 2024, and (ii) lowers the interest rate in the case of LIBOR revolving loans, to LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 1.25% to 1.75%, depending on the Average Availability and (iii) lowers the interest rate in the case of Base Rate loans, to the Base Rate (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin of 0.25% to 0.75%, depending on the Average Availability.\nYou can read more about our business segments in note 18 of the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nA substantial portion of our overall value is in our rental fleet equipment. The net book value of our rental equipment at December 31, 2018 was $1.14 billion, or approximately 66.1% of our total assets. Our rental fleet as of December 31, 2018 consisted of 40,542 units having an original acquisition cost (which we define as the cost originally paid to manufacturers or the original amount financed under any operating leases) of approximately $1.76 billion. As of December 31, 2018, our rental fleet composition was as follows (dollars in millions):\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n (5) Represents amounts due on manufacturer flooring plans payable, which are used to finance certain purchases of new equipment inventory and rental equipment. \nNon-Segmented Other Revenues Gross Profit. Our non-segmented other revenues gross loss was approximately $1 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to a gross loss of $0.6 million for the same period last year, a decrease of $0.6 million. Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 0.0% compared to a gross margin of (1.0)% in 2017, an improvement of 1.0%, primarily reflective of improved gross margins on hauling and transportation related charges in the current period and improved gross margin on damage waiver income.\nIn the normal course of our business activities, we may lease real estate, rental equipment and non-rental equipment under operating leases. See Contractual and Commercial Commitments\u201d below.\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including: the identification of reporting units; assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units; assignment of goodwill to reporting units; determination of the fair value of each reporting unit; and an assumption as to the form of the transaction in which the reporting unit would be acquired by a market participant (either a taxable or nontaxable transaction). Impairment of goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment (i.e., before aggregation or combination), or one level below an operating segment (i.e., a component). A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. Pursuant to ASC 350 and ASC 280, Segment Reporting, and other relevant guidance, we have identified two components within our Rental operating segment (Equipment Rentals Component 1 and Equipment Rentals Component 2) and have determined that each of our other four operating segments (New Equipment, Used Equipment, Parts, and Service segments) represents a reporting unit, resulting in six total reporting units.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A expenses increased $4.7 million, or 2.0%, to $232.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $228.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in SG&A expenses was attributable to several factors. Employee salaries, wages, payroll taxes, employee benefit expenses and other employee costs increased approximately $7.6 million, primarily as a result of a larger workforce compared to the same period last year, an increase in incentive compensation associated with our increase in current year revenues, and higher employer health insurance costs. Facility costs increased $1.6 million, comprised primarily of additional rent expense related to new branches opened since the fourth quarter of last year. Bad debt expense increased $0.9 million, while supplies expense and other general corporate overhead expenses increased $0.5 million. Partially offsetting these increases was a $4.1 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense due to lower software amortization costs. Legal, professional and other service fees decreased $1.1 million. General liability insurance costs decreased $0.7 million.\nServices Support. Cost of services revenues represents costs attributable to service provided for the maintenance and repair of customer-owned equipment and equipment then on-rent by customers.\nTotal Gross Profit. Our total gross profit was $359.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $335.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $24.3 million, or 7.2%. Total gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately 34.9%, an increase of 0.6% from the 34.3% gross profit margin for the same period in 2016. Gross profit and gross margin for all reportable segments and non-segmented other revenues are further described below.\nRental equipment dollar utilization (annual rental revenues divided by the average original rental fleet equipment costs) for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased 0.9% to 35.8% from 34.9% in 2017. The increase in comparative rental equipment dollar utilization was primarily the result of the increase in equipment rental rates, combined with the mix of equipment rented, which was partially offset by a decrease in rental equipment time utilization. Rental equipment time utilization as a percentage of original equipment cost was approximately 71.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 72.1% in the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of 0.5%.\nUsed Equipment Sales Revenues. Our used equipment sales increased $17.8 million, or 16.6%, to $125.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, from $107.3 million for the same period in 2017.\nAn off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with the Company.\nWe believe that our integrated business tempers the effects of downturns in a particular segment. For a discussion of seasonality, see Seasonality\u201d on page 47 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The application of many accounting principles requires us to make assumptions, estimates and/or judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These assumptions, estimates and/or judgments, however, are often subjective and they and our actual results may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analyses. If actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts first become known. We believe the following critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions, estimates and/or judgments. See also note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies.\nRevenues.\nServices Revenues. Our services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased $1.8 million, or 2.8%, to $62.9 million from $64.7 million in the same period in 2016. The decrease in services revenues was due to lower crane services revenues and lower other equipment services revenues.\nNon-Segmented Other Revenues Gross Profit. Our non-segmented other revenues gross profit increased approximately $0.6 million to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $0.2 million for the same period in 2016 on a $4.6 million increase in non-segmented other revenues. Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 1.2% compared to a gross margin of 0.3% in the same period 2016, an increase of 0.9%, primarily reflective of improved margins on hauling revenues compared to last year.\nOur internal projected results of operations serve as key inputs for developing our cash flow projections for a planning period of twelve years. Beyond this period, we also determine an assumed long-term growth rate representing the expected rate at which a reporting unit's earnings stream is expected to grow. These rates are used to calculate the terminal value of our reporting units and are added to the cash flows projected during the twelve year planning period. The WACC is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise and represents the expected cost of new capital likely to be used by market participants. The WACC is used to discount our combined future cash flows.\nPrior to our initial public offering in February 2006, our business was conducted through H&E LLC. In connection with our initial public offering, we converted H&E LLC into H&E Equipment Services, Inc. In order to have an operating Delaware corporation as the issuer for our initial public offering, H&E Equipment Services, Inc. was formed as a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of H&E Holdings L.L.C. ( H&E Holdings\u201d), and immediately prior to the closing of our initial public offering, on February 3, 2006, H&E LLC and H&E Holdings merged with and into H&E Equipment Services, Inc., which survived the reincorporation merger as the operating company. Effective February 3, 2006, H&E LLC and H&E Holdings no longer existed under operation of law pursuant to the reincorporation merger.\n\nInterest expense increased approximately $8.7 million to $63.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $55.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in interest expense was due to additional interest costs of $7.2 million associated with the upsize of our $950 million 5.625% senior unsecured notes that were issued in the third and fourth quarters of 2017 compared to our $630 million 7% senior unsecured notes, which were retired in the third quarter of 2017. Interest costs related to the Credit Facility increased $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period last year.\nRevenues.\nOur average rental rates for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased 2.1% compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Our average rental rates for the year ended December 31, 2018 do not include rental rate data for legacy CEC and Rental Inc. for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, respectively.\nWe have five reportable segments because we derive our revenues from five principal business activities: (1) equipment rentals; (2) new equipment sales; (3) used equipment sales; (4) parts sales; and (5) repair and maintenance services. These segments are based upon how we allocate resources and assess performance. In addition, we also have non-segmented revenues and costs that relate to equipment support activities.\nThe inputs and variables used in determining the fair value of a reporting unit require management to make certain assumptions regarding the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes, as well as estimates of future cash flows. Our estimates regarding future cash flows are based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance, including revenues, margins and operating expenses. These estimates involve risk and are inherently uncertain. Changes in our estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or the amount of goodwill impairment to be recognized. However, we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and represent our most likely future operating results based upon current information available. Future deterioration in the macroeconomic environment, adverse changes within our industry, further deterioration in our common stock price, downward revisions to our projected cash flows based on new information, or other factors, some of which are beyond our ability to control, could result in a future impairment charge that could materially impact our future results of operations and financial position in the reporting period identified.\nRental Expense. Rental expense represents the costs associated with rental equipment, including, among other things, the cost of servicing and maintaining our rental equipment, property taxes on our fleet and other miscellaneous costs of rental equipment.\nRevenue Recognition. Upon our adoption of Topic 606 on January 1, 2018, we recognize revenue in accordance with two applicable accounting standards: 1) Topic 606 and 2) Topic 840 (which addresses lease accounting). Topic 606 superseded Topic 605 and other legacy industry-specific revenue recognition guidance.\nOur U.S. federal tax returns for 2015 and subsequent years remain subject to examination by tax authorities. We are also subject to examination in various state jurisdictions for 2013 and subsequent years.\nUsed Equipment Sales Gross Profit. Our used equipment sales gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased approximately $5.9 million, or 17.7%, to $39.1 million from $33.2 million in 2017 on a used equipment sales increase of $17.8 million. Gross profit margin on used equipment sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 31.2%, up 0.3% from 30.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of the mix of used equipment sold and higher used equipment margins on used aerial work platform equipment sales. These improved gross margins were partially offset by lower margins on sales of CEC and Rental Inc. used equipment, reflecting the purchase accounting fair value step up basis adjustment applied to the acquired used equipment inventory and rental equipment.\nOn February 1, 2019, we further amended and extended the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with the First Amendment to the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the First Amendment\u201d) by and among the Company, Great Northern Equipment, Inc., H&E Equipment Services (California), LLC, H&E Equipment Services (Mid-Atlantic), LLC, the other credit parties named therein, the lenders named therein, Wells Fargo Capital Finance, LLC, as administrative agent, the other credit parties named therein, the lenders named therein, and the joint lead arrangers, joint book runners, co-syndication agents and documentation agent named therein.\nEquipment Rentals. Our rental operation primarily rents our four core types of construction and industrial equipment. We have a well-maintained rental fleet and our own dedicated sales force, focused by equipment type. We actively manage the size, quality, age and composition of our rental fleet based on our analysis of key measures such as time utilization (which we analyze as equipment usage based on: (1) a percentage of original equipment cost, and (2) the number of rental equipment units available for rent), rental rate trends and targets, rental equipment dollar utilization and maintenance and repair costs, which we closely monitor. We maintain fleet quality through regional quality control managers and our parts and services operations.\nThe tables included in the period-to-period comparisons below provide summaries of our revenues and gross profits for our business segments and non-segmented revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. The period-to-period comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nIncome Taxes. The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return with its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company is a C-Corporation under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. We utilize the asset and liability approach to measure deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences existing at each balance sheet date using currently enacted tax rates in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740\u201d). ASC 740 takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rate is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date of that tax rate.\nThe New Notes rank equally in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness and rank senior to any of our subordinated indebtedness. The New Notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by all of our current and future significant domestic restricted subsidiaries. In addition, the New Notes are effectively subordinated to all of our and the guarantors' existing and future secured indebtedness, including the Credit Facility, to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness, and are structurally subordinated to all of the liabilities and preferred stock of any of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the New Notes.\nOur contractual obligations and commercial commitments principally include obligations associated with our outstanding indebtedness and interest payments as of December 31, 2018.\nThe amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including general economic conditions and growth prospects. Our gross rental fleet capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2018 were approximately $440.9 million, including $24.3 million of non-cash transfers from new and used equipment to rental fleet inventory. Our gross property and equipment capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $35.0 million. In response to changing economic conditions, we believe we have the flexibility to modify our capital expenditures by adjusting them (either up or down) to match our actual performance.\nParts Sales Revenues. Our parts sales revenues decreased approximately $1.8 million, or 1.6%, to $107.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $109.1 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease in parts revenues was driven primarily by lower crane parts sales revenues.\nEquipment Rentals Gross Profit. Our gross profit from equipment rentals for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $62.4 million, or 26.9%, to approximately $294.2 million from $231.9 million in 2017.\nRental Fleet\nEffective January 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Contractors Equipment Center, a privately-held company focused on non-residential construction equipment rentals serving the greater Denver, Colorado area out of three branch locations. Effective April 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Rental, Inc., a privately-held equipment rental and distribution company with five branch locations in Alabama and Florida. Effective February 1, 2019, we completed the acquisition of We-Rent-It, a privately-held equipment rental company with six branch locations in Central Texas.\nServices Revenues Gross Profit. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our services revenues gross profit increased $0.4 million, or 1.0%, to $42.2 million from $41.8 million for the same period in 2017 on a $0.6 million increase in services revenues. Gross profit margin on services revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was 66.4%.\nServices Revenues Gross Profit. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our services revenues gross profit decreased approximately $1.1 million, or 2.5%, to $41.8 million from $42.8 million for the same period in 2016 on a $1.8 million decrease in services revenues. Gross profit margin on services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 66.4%, up 0.2% from 66.2% in the same period in 2016, as a result of services revenues mix.\nThe following discussion summarizes the financial position of H&E Equipment Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2018, and its results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018, and should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties (see discussion of Forward-Looking Statements\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those factors set forth under Item 1A - Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Company intends to continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends; however, the declaration of any subsequent dividends is discretionary and will be subject to a final determination by the Board of Directors each quarter after its review of, among other things, business and market conditions.\nGain on Sales of Property and Equipment, Net. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold a parcel of company-owned land and realized a gain of approximately $3.7 million, resulting in total net gains on sales of property and equipment of $7.1 million for the period, compared to $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $2.1 million.\n \u2022 Parts Sales. Our parts business sells new and used parts for the equipment we sell and also provides parts to our own rental fleet. To a lesser degree, we also sell parts for equipment produced by manufacturers whose products we neither rent nor sell. In order to provide timely parts and services support to our customers as well as our own rental fleet, we maintain an extensive parts inventory. \nUnder Topic 606, revenue from contracts with customers is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract with the customer and excludes any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. We recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for such products or services.\nContractual and Commercial Commitments\nIf the two-step goodwill test must be performed, we determine whether the fair value of our goodwill reporting units is greater than their carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired. However, if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then the second step of the impairment test is performed to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we record an impairment loss for the excess amount. See also the Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d discussion in note 2 to these consolidated financial statements for new pending accounting guidance, which removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test.\nWe generate cash primarily from our operating activities and, historically, we have used cash flows from operating activities, manufacturer floor plan financings and available borrowings under the Credit Facility as the primary sources of funds to purchase inventory and to fund working capital and capital expenditures, growth and expansion opportunities (see also Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below). Our management of our working capital is closely tied to operating cash flows, as working capital can be significantly impacted by, among other things, our accounts receivable activities, the level of new and used equipment inventories, which may increase or decrease in response to current and expected demand, and the size and timing of our trade accounts payable payment cycles.\nOur non-segmented other revenues for the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K relate to equipment support activities that we provide, such as transportation, hauling, parts freight and damage waivers, and are not generally allocated to reportable segments.\nPrincipal External Factors that Affect our Businesses\nResults of Operations\n\nThe pie charts below illustrate a breakdown of our revenues and gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 by business segment (see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our business segments):\nOur non-segmented revenues and costs for the periods presented in the Annual Report on Form 10-K relate to equipment support activities that we provide, such as transportation, hauling, parts freight and damage waivers, and are not generally allocated to reportable segments.\nGross profit margin on equipment rentals for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately 49.7% compared to 48.4% in 2017, an increase of 1.3%. As a percentage of equipment rental revenues, rental expenses were 15.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 16.2% for the same period last year, a decrease of 1.1%, resulting primarily from the increase in equipment rental revenues. Depreciation expense was 35.2% of equipment rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 35.4% for the same period in 2017, a decrease of 0.2%, primarily as a result of the increase in equipment rental revenues, which was partially offset by the increase in depreciation expense resulting from the purchase accounting fair value step up adjustments on the CEC and Rental Inc. acquired rental fleets, and the mix of our equipment rental fleet.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A expenses increased $45.5 million, or approximately 19.6%, to $278.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $232.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nPrincipal Cash Flows\nThe net increase in SG&A expenses was attributable to several factors. Employee salaries, wages, payroll taxes and related employee benefit and other employee expenses increased $30.8 million, primarily as a result of our CEC and Rental Inc. acquisitions, a larger workforce and higher incentive compensation related to improved profitability. Legal and professional fees increased $3.6 million. Supply costs increased $2.0 million. Utilities costs increased $1.7 million and other facility-related expenses increased $1.8 million. Promotional expenses increased $1.1 million. Liability insurance costs increased $0.9 million. Additionally, our results for the year ended December 31, 2018 also includes $3.3 million of amortization expense associated with the recognition of intangible assets resulting from the CEC and Rental Inc. purchase price allocations.\n (3) This includes a real estate capital lease for which the related liability has been recorded (including interest) at the present value of future minimum lease payments due under the leases. \nOur average rental rates for the year ended December 31, 2018 were approximately 2.1% higher than the year ended December 31, 2017 (see further discussion on rental rates in Results of Operations\u201d below).\nInventories. We state our new and used equipment inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value by specific identification. Parts and supplies are stated at the lower of the weighted average cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is considered to be the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable cost of completion, disposal and transportation. We maintain allowances for damaged, slow-moving and unmarketable inventory to reflect the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value. Changes in product demand may affect the value of inventory on hand and may require higher inventory allowances. Uncertainties with respect to inventory valuation are inherent in the preparation of financial statements.\nEquipment Rentals Gross Profit. Our gross profit from equipment rentals for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $20.7 million, or 9.8%, to approximately $231.9 million from $211.1 million in 2016. The increase in equipment rentals gross profit was the result of a $33.8 million increase in rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was partially offset by a $7.l million increase in equipment rental depreciation expense and a $6.0 million increase in rental expenses. The increase in rental expenses is primarily due to higher repair costs and increased property taxes resulting from a larger rental fleet size. The increase in rental equipment depreciation expense is largely due also to a larger rental fleet size. Gross profit margin on equipment rentals for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately 48.4% compared to 47.4% for the same period in 2016, an increase of 1.0%. Depreciation expense was 35.4% of equipment rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 36.5% for the same period in 2016, a decrease of 1.1%. As a percentage of equipment rental revenues, rental expenses were 16.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to approximately 16.1% for the same period in 2016, an increase of 0.1%.\nThe original acquisition cost of our gross rental fleet increased by approximately $361.0 million, or 25.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, largely reflective of the CEC and Rental Inc. acquired fleets, combined with increase in 2018 rental capital expenditures to meet customer demand. The average age of our rental fleet equipment decreased by approximately 0.1 months for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nGoodwill. We have made acquisitions in the past that resulted in the recognition of goodwill. Pursuant to ASC 350, goodwill is the excess of the consideration transferred plus the fair value of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if triggering events occur or other impairment indicators arise which might impair recoverability.\nAcquisitions and Start-up Facilities\nBranches opened since January 1, 2016 with less than twelve full months of comparable operations in 2016 and 2017 contributed $3.6 million to the increase in our SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016.\nNon-Segmented Other Revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our other revenues were $74.8 million, an increase of approximately $11.5 million, or 18.2%, from $63.2 million in 2017. This increase was primarily driven by higher hauling revenues and damage waiver income associated with our equipment rental activities, combined with non-segmented other revenues from our CEC and Rental Inc. locations.\nPursuant to Topic 840, we accounted, for the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for equipment rental agreements as operating leases and recognized revenue from equipment rentals in the period earned, regardless of the timing of billing to customers. A rental contract includes rates for daily, weekly or monthly use, and rental revenues are earned on a daily basis as rental contracts remain outstanding. Because rental contracts can extend across multiple reporting periods, we record unbilled rental revenues and deferred rental revenues at the end of reporting periods so rental revenues earned is appropriately stated for the periods presented. We recognize revenue for certain ancillary fees we charge customers: to protect the customer against liability for damage to our equipment while on rent; for fuel; and for environmental costs. Revenues from these ancillary fees are recognized in the period earned. Under Topic 840, we present these ancillary fees we charge to customers in other revenues. Effective January 1, 2019, Topic 842 became effective, replacing Topic 840. See also the Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d discussion in note 2 to these consolidated financial statements for further information related to our adoption of Topic 606 on January 1, 2018 and Topic 842, which became effective on January 1, 2019.\nOther Income (Expense). For the year ended December 31, 2018, our net other expenses decreased approximately $16.6 million to $62.0 million compared to $78.6 million for the same period in 2017. Included in Other Income (Expense) for the year ended December 31, 2017 is a $25.4 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt (see Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt\u201d below).\nThe Amended and Restated Credit Agreement continues to provide for, among other things, a $30 million letter of credit sub-facility, and a guaranty by certain of the Company's subsidiaries of the obligations under the Credit Facility. In addition, the Credit Facility remains secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries.\nParts Sales Revenues. Our parts sales revenues increased $6.2 million, or 5.4%, to $120.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $114.3 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in parts sales was largely attributable to increases in crane parts sales, aerial work platform equipment parts sales and earthmoving equipment parts sales, combined with parts sales revenues from our CEC and Rental Inc. locations.\n \u2022 Services. Our services operation provides maintenance and repair services for our customers' equipment and to our own rental fleet at our facilities as well as at our customers' locations. As the authorized distributor for numerous equipment manufacturers, we are able to provide service to that equipment that will be covered under the manufacturer's warranty. \nOn December 22, 2017, the Act was signed into law. Included in the Act is a reduction in the corporate statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective for us as of January 1, 2018. Under ASC 740, the effects of changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which the new legislation is enacted. In the case of U.S. federal income taxes, the enactment date is the date the bill becomes law (i.e., upon presidential signature). We have completed our accounting for all the tax effects of the enactment of the Act.\n\nOur used equipment sales from the rental fleet, which comprised approximately 89.6% and 89.7% of our used equipment sales for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were approximately 152.1% and 149.6% of net book value for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nOur non-segmented other expenses for the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include costs associated with providing transportation, hauling, parts freight, and damage waiver including, among other items, drivers' wages, fuel costs, shipping costs, and our costs related to damage waiver policies.\nNew Equipment Sales Gross Profit. Our new equipment sales gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $1.5 million, or 6.9%, to $22.6 million compared to $21.1 million for the same period in 2016 on an increase in total new equipment sales of $6.6 million. Gross profit margin on new equipment sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 11.1%, an increase of 0.4% from 10.7% in the same period in 2016, as a result of the mix of new equipment sold.\n \u2022 Spending levels by customers. Rentals and sales of equipment to the construction industry and to industrial companies constitute a significant portion of our total revenues. As a result, we depend upon customers in these businesses and their ability and willingness to make capital expenditures to rent or buy specialized equipment. Accordingly, our business is impacted by fluctuations in customers' spending levels on capital expenditures and by the availability of credit to those customers. \nThe indenture governing the New Notes contains certain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to: (i) incur additional indebtedness, assume a guarantee or issue preferred stock; (ii) pay dividends or make other equity distributions or payments to or affecting our subsidiaries; (iii) purchase or redeem our capital stock; (iv) make certain investments; (v) create liens; (vi) sell or dispose of assets or engage in mergers or consolidations; (vii) engage in certain transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates; (viii) enter into sale-leaseback transactions; and (ix) engage in certain business activities. Each of the covenants is subject to exceptions and qualifications. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with these covenants.\n \u2022 Equipment Rentals. Our rental operation primarily rents our four core types of construction and industrial equipment. We have a well-maintained rental fleet and our own dedicated sales force, focused by equipment type. We actively manage the size, quality, age and composition of our rental fleet based on our analysis of key measures such as time utilization (which we analyze as equipment usage based on: (1) a percentage of original equipment cost, and (2) the number of rental equipment units available for rent), rental rate trends and targets, rental equipment dollar utilization and maintenance and repair costs, which we closely monitor. We maintain fleet quality through regional quality control managers and our parts and services operations. \nOn August 24, 2017, we completed an offering of $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.6250% senior notes due 2025 (the New Notes\u201d) and the settlement of a cash tender offer (the Tender Offer\u201d) with respect to our 7% senior notes due 2022 (the Old Notes\u201d). Net proceeds, after deducting $10.3 million of estimated offering expenses, from the sale of the New Notes totaled approximately $739.7 million. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the New Notes to repurchase $329.7 million of aggregate principal amount of the Old Notes in early settlement of the Tender Offer, which the Company launched on August 17, 2017. Holders who tendered their Old Notes prior to the early tender deadline received $1,038.90 per $1,000 principal amount of Old Notes tendered, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the payment date of August 24, 2017. Effective as of August 24, 2017, we (i) provided notice of the redemption of all remaining Old Notes that were not validly tendered in the Tender Offer at the expiration time and (ii) satisfied and discharged the indenture governing the Old Notes in accordance with its terms. On September 25, 2017, we redeemed the remaining $300.3 million principal amount outstanding of the Old Notes at a redemption price equal to 103.50% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the date of redemption.\nASC 350 permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not (a likelihood of greater than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case, the currently prescribed two-step goodwill test must be performed. Otherwise, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. Considerable judgment is required by management in using the qualitative approach under ASC 350 to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. ASC 350 suggests that a qualitative assessment may become less relevant over time. In other words, the longer it has been since the last quantitative assessment, the more difficult it could be for a company to conclude that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Our most recent quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment was as of October 1, 2016, whereby we bypassed the qualitative assessment for each reporting unit and proceeded directly to Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test. Our goodwill impairment testing as of that date indicated that there was no impairment among our reporting units as estimated fair values exceeded their respective carrying amounts.\nOther Income (Expense). For the year ended December 31, 2017, our net other expenses increased $26.8 million to $78.6 million, compared to $51.7 million in 2016. Included in Other Income (Expense) for the year ended December 31, 2017 is a $25.4 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt (see discussion immediately below regarding the issuance of the New Notes). Interest expense was $55.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $53.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $1.4 million. The increase in interest expense is primarily related to the timing of the issuance of the New Notes in relation to the redemption of the Old Notes. Our New Notes were issued on August 24, 2017, while approximately $300.3 million of the Old Notes remained outstanding until the September 25, 2017 redemption date. Miscellaneous other income was $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $1.9 million in 2016, a decrease of $0.1 million.\nNew equipment sales: Revenues from the sales of new equipment are recognized at the time of delivery to, or pick-up by, the customer, which is when the customer obtains control of the promised good.\nEquipment sales cycles are also subject to some seasonality with the peak selling period during the spring season and extending through the summer. Parts and services activities are typically less affected by changes in demand caused by seasonality.\nAs a percentage of total revenues, SG&A expenses were 22.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of 0.7% from 23.3% for the same period in 2016, primarily as a result of the increase in 2017 total revenues.\nServices. We derive our services revenues from maintenance and repair services to customers for their owned equipment. In addition to repair and maintenance on an as-needed or scheduled basis, we also provide ongoing preventative maintenance services to industrial customers. Our after-market service provides a high-margin, relatively stable source of revenue through changing economic cycles.\n\nThe accounting for the types of revenues accounted for pursuant to Topic 606 is discussed below. Substantially all of our revenues under Topic 606 are recognized at a point-in-time rather than over time.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nIncome Taxes. We recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $50.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to income tax expense of approximately $21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. On December 22, 2017, the Act was signed into law. Under ASC 740, the effects of changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which the new legislation is enacted. With respect to U.S. federal income taxes, the enactment date is the date the bill becomes law (i.e. upon presidential signature). Therefore, we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 a one-time decrease in income tax expense of $66.9 million from the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the decrease in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% under the Act.\nQuarterly Dividend\nBusiness Segments\nUsed Equipment Sales. Cost of used equipment sold consists of the net book value of rental equipment for used equipment sold from our rental fleet, the equipment costs for used equipment we purchase for sale or the trade-in value of used equipment that we obtain from customers in equipment sales transactions.\nSeasonality\nParts Sales. We generate revenues from the sale of new and used parts for equipment that we rent or sell, as well as for other makes of equipment. Our product support sales representatives are instrumental in generating our parts revenues. They are product specialists and receive performance incentives for achieving certain sales levels. Most of our parts sales come from our extensive in-house parts inventory. Our parts sales provide us with a relatively stable revenue stream that is generally less sensitive to the economic cycles that tend to affect our rental and equipment sales operations.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nApproximately $4.0 million of the total increase in SG&A expenses was attributable to branches opened since January 1, 2017 (but excluding for this purpose branches acquired as a result of our CEC and Rental Inc. acquisitions) with less than a full year of comparable operations in either or both of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nThe New Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time on or after September 1, 2020 at specified redemption prices plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. We may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the New Notes before September 1, 2020 with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings. We may also redeem the New Notes prior to September 1, 2020 at a specified make-whole\u201d redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.\nMerger costs incurred in the year ended December 31, 2018 were approximately $0.7 million.\nThe Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, among other things, (i) extended the maturity date of the credit facility from May 21, 2019 to December 22, 2022, (ii) increased the commitments under the senior secured asset based revolver provided for therein from $602.5 million to $750 million, (iii) increased the uncommitted incremental revolving capacity from $150 million to $250 million, (iv) provided that the unused line fee margin will be either 0.375% or 0.25%, depending on the Average Revolver Usage (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) of the borrowers, (v) lowered the interest rate (a) in the case of base rate revolving loans, to the base rate plus an applicable margin of 0.50% to 1.00% depending on the Average Availability (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) and (b) in the case of LIBOR revolving loans, to LIBOR (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin of 1.50% to 2.00%, depending on the Average Availability, (vi) lowered the margin applicable to the letter of credit fee to between 1.50% and 2.00%, depending on the Average Availability, and (vii) permitted, subject to certain conditions, an unlimited amount of Permitted Acquisitions, Restricted Payments and prepayments of Indebtedness (in each case, as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement).\n (2) As described in further detail elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Credit Facility was amended on February 1, 2019. \nNon-Segmented Other Revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our other revenues were $70.1 million, an increase of approximately $4.6 million, or 7.1%, from $65.5 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in hauling revenues, fuel charges and damage waiver income associated with the increase in our equipment rental activity.\nWe periodically engage in evaluations of potential acquisitions and start-up facilities. We intend to continue to evaluate and pursue, on an opportunistic basis, acquisitions which meet our selection criteria, and we are focused on identifying and acquiring rental companies to complement our existing business, broaden our geographic footprint, and increase our density in existing markets.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our cash provided by our investing activities was exceeded by our cash used in our investing activities, resulting in net cash used in our investing activities of approximately $526.2 million. The acquisitions of CEC and Rental Inc. totaled approximately $196.0 million (net of cash acquired)and purchases of rental and non-rental equipment totaled approximately $451.6 million, which were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of rental and non-rental equipment of approximately $121.3 million.\nagreements, we base the value of non-compete agreements on the amounts assigned to them in the purchase agreements as these amounts represent the amounts negotiated in an arm's length transaction. When not negotiated by the parties in the applicable purchase agreements, the fair value of non-compete agreements is estimated based on an income approach since their values are representative of the current and future revenue and profit erosion protection they provide. Customer relationships are generally valued based on an excess earnings or income approach with consideration to projected cash flows. We use an independent third party valuation firm to assist us with estimating the fair values of our acquired intangible assets.\nInterest Expense:\nLong-lived Assets. Our long-lived assets principally consist of rental equipment and property and equipment. We review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In reviewing for impairment, the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset's recorded value, an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value. The determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of long-lived and intangible assets involves significant estimates and judgment on the part of management. Our estimates and assumptions may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as changes in economic conditions, changes in our business prospects or other changing circumstances.\nCertain Information Concerning Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nMerger Costs (net of Merger Breakup Fee Proceeds). Pursuant to the terms of our terminated merger agreement with Neff, in August 2017 we received a $13.2 million breakup fee concurrently with Neff's termination of the merger agreement. Merger fees related to the proposed Neff merger totaled $6.5 million and estimated merger fees for the year ended December 31, 2017 associated with our acquisition of CEC in January 2018 totaled $0.8 million, resulting in net breakup fees of approximately $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.", "item_7_text": "New Equipment Sales. We seek to optimize revenues from new equipment sales by selling equipment through a professional in-house retail sales force focused by product type. While sales of new equipment are impacted by the availability of equipment from the manufacturer, we believe our status as a leading distributor for some of our key suppliers improves our ability to obtain equipment. New equipment sales are an important component of our integrated model due to customer interaction and service contact and new equipment sales also lead to future parts and services revenues.\nOur largest expenses are the costs to purchase the new equipment we sell, the costs associated with the used equipment we sell, rental expenses, rental depreciation and costs associated with parts sales and services, all of which are included in cost of revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our total cost of revenues was approximately $800.4 million. Our operating expenses consist principally of selling, general and administrative expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our selling, general and administrative expenses were $278.3 million. In addition, we have interest expense related to our debt instruments. Operating expenses and all other income and expense items below the gross profit line of our consolidated statements of income are not generally allocated to our reportable segments.\nThe success of our growth strategy depends, in part, on selecting strategic acquisition candidates at attractive prices and identifying strategic start-up locations. We expect to face competition for acquisition candidates, which may limit the number of acquisition opportunities and lead to higher acquisition costs. We may not have the financial resources necessary to consummate any acquisitions or to successfully open any new facilities in the future or the ability to obtain the necessary funds on satisfactory terms. For further information regarding our risks related to acquisitions, see Item 1A - Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur principal sources of liquidity have been from cash provided by operating activities and the sales of new, used and rental fleet equipment, proceeds from the issuance of debt, and borrowings available under the Credit Facility. Our principal uses of cash have been to fund operating activities and working capital (including new and used equipment inventories), purchases of rental fleet equipment and property and equipment, fund payments due under facility operating leases and manufacturer flooring plans payable, fund acquisitions and to meet debt service requirements. In the future, we may pursue additional strategic acquisitions and seek to open new start-up locations. We anticipate that the above described uses will be the principal demands on our cash in the future.\nCash Requirements Related to Operations\nIncome Taxes. We recorded income tax expense of $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to an income tax benefit of approximately $50.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 26.8%.\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements as described above. Further, we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We are, therefore, not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. We have also evaluated our relationships with related parties and determined that none of the related party interests represent variable interest entities pursuant to ASC 810, Consolidation.\nOn each of February 16, 2018, May 16, 2018, August 8, 2018 and November 7, 2018, the Company announced a quarterly dividend of $0.275 per share to stockholders of record, which were paid on March 9, 2018, June 15 2018, September 7, 2018 and December 7, 2018, respectively, totaling approximately $39.3 million. On February 8, 2019, the Company announced a quarterly dividend of $0.275 per share to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 20, 2019, which is to be paid on March 8, 2019.\nAs of February 14, 2019, we operated 96 full-service facilities throughout the Intermountain, Southwest, Gulf Coast, West Coast, Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. Our work force includes distinct, focused sales forces for our new and used equipment sales and rental operations, highly skilled service technicians, product specialists and regional managers. We focus our sales and rental activities on, and organize our personnel principally by, our four core equipment categories. We believe this allows us to provide specialized equipment knowledge, improve the effectiveness of our rental and sales force and strengthen our customer relationships. In addition, we have branch managers for each location who are responsible for managing their assets and financial results. We believe this fosters accountability in our business and strengthens our local and regional relationships.\nUsed Equipment Sales. We generate the majority of our used equipment sales revenues by selling equipment from our rental fleet. The remainder of our used equipment sales revenues comes from the sale of inventoried equipment that we acquire through trade-ins from our equipment customers and selective purchases of high-quality used equipment. Our policy is not to offer specified price trade-in arrangements on equipment for sale. Sales of our rental fleet equipment allow us to manage the size, quality, composition and age of our rental fleet, and provide us with a profitable distribution channel for the disposal of rental equipment.\nAlthough we believe our business is not materially impacted by seasonality, the demand for our rental equipment tends to be lower in the winter months. The level of equipment rental activities is directly related to commercial and industrial construction and maintenance activities. Therefore, equipment rental performance will be correlated to the levels of current construction activities. The severity of weather conditions can have a temporary impact on the level of construction activities. Adverse weather has a seasonal impact in parts of the markets we serve, including our Intermountain region, particularly in the winter months.\nOur selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses include sales and marketing expenses, payroll and related benefit costs, including stock compensation expense, insurance expenses, legal and professional fees, rent and other occupancy costs, property and other taxes, administrative overhead, depreciation associated with property and equipment (other than rental equipment) and amortization expense associated with intangible assets. These expenses are not generally allocated to our reportable segments.\nAs one of the largest integrated equipment services companies in the United States focused on heavy construction and industrial equipment, we rent, sell and provide parts and services support for four core categories of specialized equipment: (1) hi-lift or aerial work platform equipment; (2) cranes; (3) earthmoving equipment; and (4) industrial lift trucks. By providing equipment rental, sales, on-site parts, repair and maintenance functions under one roof, we are a one-stop provider for our customers' varied equipment needs. This full service approach provides us with multiple points of customer contact, enables us to maintain a high quality rental fleet, as well as an effective distribution channel for fleet disposal and provides cross-selling opportunities among our new and used equipment sales, rental, parts sales and services operations.\nRental equipment dollar utilization (annual rental revenues divided by the average original rental fleet equipment costs) for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 0.9% to 34.9% from 34.0% in 2016. The increase in comparative rental equipment dollar utilization was the result of an increase in rental equipment time utilization, combined with a 0.2% increase in average rental rates. Rental equipment time utilization as a percentage of original equipment cost was 72.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to approximately 69.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 2.4%. The increase in equipment rental time utilization based on original equipment cost is largely reflective of increased demand in 2017 for rental equipment, especially aerial work platform equipment.\n \u2022 Economic downturns. The demand for our products is dependent on the general economy, the stability of the global credit markets, the industries in which our customers operate or serve, and other factors. Downturns in the general economy or in the construction and manufacturing industries, as well as adverse credit market conditions, can cause demand for our products to materially decrease. \nInterest expense for the periods presented represents the interest on our outstanding debt instruments, including aggregate amounts outstanding under our revolving senior secured credit facility (the Credit Facility\u201d), senior unsecured notes due 2025 and our capital lease obligations, as well as our extinguished senior unsecured notes due 2022 (the Old Notes\u201d) for the periods during which such Old Notes were outstanding. Interest expense also includes interest on our outstanding manufacturer flooring plans payable which are used to finance inventory and rental equipment purchases. Non-cash interest expense related to the amortization cost of deferred financing costs and the accretion/amortization of note discount/premium are also included in interest expense.\nReserves for Claims. We are exposed to various claims relating to our business, including those for which we provide self-insurance. Claims for which we self-insure up to specified retention limits include: (1) workers compensation claims; (2) general liability claims by third parties for injury or property damage caused by our equipment or personnel; (3) automobile liability claims; and (4) employee health insurance claims. These types of claims may take a substantial amount of time to resolve and, accordingly, the ultimate liability associated with a particular claim, including claims incurred but not reported as of a period-end reporting date, may not be known for an extended period of time. Our methodology for developing self-insurance reserves is based on management estimates and independent third party actuarial estimates. Our estimation process considers, among other matters, the cost of known claims over time, cost inflation and incurred but not reported claims. These estimates may change based on, among other things, changes in our claim history or receipt of additional information relevant to assessing the claims. Further, these estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as adverse judicial determinations or other claim settlements at higher than estimated amounts. Accordingly, we may be required to increase or decrease our reserve levels.\n \u2022 New Equipment Sales. Our new equipment sales operation sells new equipment in all of our four core product categories. We have a retail sales force focused by equipment type that is separate from our rental sales force. Manufacturer purchase terms and pricing are managed by our product specialists. \nWith the exception of goodwill, long-lived fixed assets generally represent the largest component of our acquisitions. Typically, the long-lived fixed assets that we acquire are primarily comprised of rental fleet equipment. Historically, virtually all of the rental equipment that we have acquired through business combinations have been classified as To be Used,\u201d rather than as To be Sold.\u201d Equipment that we acquire and classify as To be Used\u201d is recorded at fair value. Any significant inventories of new and used equipment acquired in the transaction are valued at fair value, which should approximate a market participant's estimated selling price adjusted for (1) costs in the selling effort and (2) a reasonable profit allowance.\nThe Add-on Notes were issued as additional notes under an indenture dated as of August 24, 2017, pursuant to which we previously issued the New Notes as described above. The Add-on Notes have identical terms to, rank equally with and form a part of a single class of securities with the New Notes.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the cash provided by our financing activities was approximately $85.1 million. Dividends totaling approximately $39.2 million, or $1.10 per common share, were paid during the year ended December 31, 2017. Net payments under the Credit Facility were $162.6 million. Payments on capital lease obligations were $0.2 million. Purchases of treasury stock were $0.8 million. In connection with the redemption of our Old Notes, we paid $653.3 million, representing aggregate principal payments of $630.0 million and tender and redemption premiums totaling approximately $23.3 million. In connection with the issuance of our New Notes and Add-on Notes, we received net proceeds of $958.5 million. Deferred financing costs paid in connection with the New Notes and Add-on Notes as well as the Credit Facility totaled $17.3 million.\nCash Flow from Operating Activities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the cash provided by our operating activities was $247.2 million. Our reported net income of $76.6 million, when adjusted for non-cash income and expense items, such as depreciation and amortization (including net amortization (accretion) of note discount (premium)), deferred income taxes, provision for losses on accounts receivable, provision for inventory obsolescence, stock-based compensation expense and net gains on the sale of long-lived assets, provided positive cash flows of $302.9 million. These cash flows from operating activities were also positively impacted by a $7.0 increase in accounts payable and a $2.8 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities. Additionally, manufacturing flooring plans payable and deferred compensation increased $1.7 million and $0.1 million, respectfully. Partially offsetting these positive cash flows were a $48.2 million increase in inventories and a $17.8 million increase in receivables. Also, prepaid expenses and other assets increased $1.0 million and dividends payable increased $0.2 million.\nUsed Equipment Sales Revenues. Our used equipment sales increased $10.4 million, or 10.8%, to $107.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $96.9 million for the same period in 2016. Sales of used earthmoving equipment increased $5.4 million and sales of used cranes increased $3.1 million. Sales of used other equipment increased $1.2 million, while sales of used lift trucks and used aerial work platform equipment increased $0.5 million and $0.2 million, respectively.\nNew Equipment Sales. Cost of new equipment sold primarily consists of the equipment cost of the new equipment that is sold, net of any amount of credit given to the customer towards the equipment for trade-ins.\nWe generate all of our total revenues from our five business segments and our non-segmented equipment support activities. Equipment rentals and new equipment sales account for more than half of our total revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 47.8% of our total revenues were attributable to equipment rentals, 21.3% of our total revenues were attributable to new equipment sales, 10.1% were attributable to used equipment sales, 9.7% were attributable to parts sales, 5.1% were attributable to our services revenues and 6.0% were attributable to non-segmented other revenues.\nParts Sales Gross Profit. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our parts sales revenue gross profit increased $1.1 million, or 3.4%, to $32.2 million from $31.1 million for the same period in 2017 on a $6.2 million increase in parts sales revenues. Gross profit margin on parts sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 26.7%, a decrease of 0.5% from 27.2% in the same period in 2017, as a result of the mix of parts sold.\nThe amount of depreciation expense we record is highly dependent upon the estimated useful lives and the salvage values assigned to each category of rental equipment. Generally, we assign estimated useful lives to our rental fleet ranging from a three-year life, five-year life with a 25% salvage value, seven-year life and a ten-year life. Depreciation expense on our rental fleet for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $208.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the estimated impact of a change in estimated useful lives for each category of equipment by two years was as follows:\nThe increase in equipment rentals gross profit was the result of a $113.2 million increase in equipment rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to last year, which was partially offset by a $38.9 million increase in rental equipment depreciation expense and an $11.9 million increase in rental expenses. The increases in both depreciation expense and rental expenses are primarily due to a larger fleet size in 2018 compared to 2017.\n</td> </tr>\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td>\nOur deferred tax calculation requires management to make certain estimates about future operations. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the cash provided by our operating activities was $226.2 million. Our reported net income of $109.7 million, when adjusted for non-cash income and expense items, such as depreciation and amortization, (including net amortization (accretion) of note discount (premium)), deferred income taxes, provision for losses on accounts receivable, provision for inventory obsolescence, stock-based compensation expense and net gains on the sale of long-lived assets, provided positive cash flows of $249.8 million. These cash flows from operating activities were also positively impacted by a $50.3 increase in accounts payable and an $8.2 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities. Partially offsetting these positive cash flows were a $40.0 million increase in receivables, a $31.8 million increase in inventories, an $8.8 million decrease in manufacturing flooring plans payable and a $1.7 million increase in prepared expenses and other assets.\n (4) This includes total minimum operating lease rental payments having initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms longer than one year. \nEquipment Rental Revenues. Our revenues from equipment rentals for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $113.2 million, or 23.6%, to $592.2 million from $479.0 million in 2017. The increase in equipment rental revenues was largely due to increased demand and the equipment rental revenues from our CEC and Rental Inc. locations.\nSales of new cranes increased $44.3 million, resulting from improved crane demand. Sales of new aerial work platform equipment increased $13.8 million. Sales of new lift trucks and new earthmoving equipment increased $1.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively. Partially offsetting these increases in new equipment sales was a $3.3 million decrease in new other equipment sales. The product line new equipment sales revenue fluctuations above do not include the impact of legacy CEC and Rental Inc. new equipment sales revenues by product line for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, respectively.\n\nOther revenues: Other revenues relate primarily to hauling fees for transporting rental equipment and equipment sold to and from the customer and ancillary charges associated with equipment maintenance and repair services. Such revenues are recognized at the time the services are performed.\nRental revenues from aerial work platform equipment increased $66.7 million and earthmoving equipment rental revenues increased $24.3 million, while rental revenues from other equipment and lift trucks increased $8.5 million and $3.0 million, respectively. Partially offsetting these increases in equipment rental revenues was a $1.1 million decrease in crane rental revenues. The product line equipment rental revenue fluctuations above do not include the impact of legacy CEC and Rental Inc. equipment rental revenues by product line for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, respectively.\nThrough our predecessor companies, we have been in the equipment services business for approximately 58 years. H&E Equipment Services L.L.C. ( H&E LLC\u201d) was formed in June 2002 through the business combination of Head & Engquist Equipment, LLC ( Head & Engquist\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gulf Wide Industries, L.L.C. ( Gulf Wide\u201d), and ICM Equipment Company L.L.C. ( ICM\u201d). Head & Engquist, founded in 1961, and ICM, founded in 1971, were two leading regional, integrated equipment service companies operating in contiguous geographic markets. In the June 2002 transaction, Head & Engquist and ICM were merged with and into Gulf Wide, which was renamed H&E LLC. Prior to the combination, Head & Engquist operated 25 facilities in the Gulf Coast region, and ICM operated 16 facilities in the Intermountain region of the United States.\nNew Equipment Sales Revenues. Our new equipment sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $6.6 million, or 3.4%, to $203.3 million from $196.7 million in 2016, as new crane sales increased $11.8 million. Sales of new other equipment increased $7.1 million and sales of new aerial work platform equipment increased $3.3 million. Partially offsetting these increases in new equipment sales were a $15.3 million decrease in new earthmoving equipment sales and a $0.3 million decrease in new lift truck sales.\nRental revenues: An insignificant portion of our total equipment rental revenues are recognized pursuant to Topic 606 rather than pursuant to Topic 840. These revenues represent services performed by us in connection with the rental of equipment and are comprised of customer training fees on rented equipment and erection and dismantling services on rental equipment. Revenues for these services are recognized upon completion of such services. See discussion below regarding rental revenues recognized pursuant to Topic 840.\nIf we experience a change of control, we will be required to offer to purchase the New Notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase.\nRevenue Sources\nBased on available evidence, both positive and negative, we believe it is more likely than not that our federal deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017 are fully realizable through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income, and are not subject to any limitations. However, for the year ended December 31, 2017, we increased our valuation allowance by $0.5 million for certain state net operating losses that may not be utilized.\nEquipment Rental Revenues. Our revenues from equipment rentals for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $33.8 million, or 7.6%, to $479.0 million from $445.2 million in 2016. Rental revenues from aerial work platform equipment increased $30.7 million and earthmoving equipment rental revenues increased $5.5 million, while rental revenues from other equipment and lift trucks increased $2.8 million and $0.5 million, respectively. Partially offsetting these increases in equipment rental revenues was a $5.7 million decrease in crane rental revenues. Our average rental rates for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 0.2% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe rental equipment mix among our four core product lines for the year ended December 31, 2018 was largely consistent with that of the prior year comparable period as a percentage of total units available for rent and as a percentage of original acquisition cost.\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nUsed Equipment Sales Gross Profit. Our used equipment sales gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $3.0 million, or 10.0%, to $33.2 million from $30.2 million in the same period in 2016 on an increase in used equipment sales of $10.4 million. Gross profit margin on used equipment sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 30.9%, down 0.2% from 31.1% for the same period in 2016, primarily as a result of the mix of used equipment sold. Our used equipment sales from the rental fleet, which comprised approximately 89.7% and 87.1% of our used equipment sales for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, were approximately 149.6% and 152.4% of net book value for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nParts sales: Revenues from the sales of equipment parts are recognized at the time of pick-up by the customer for parts counter sales transactions. For parts that are shipped to a customer, we elected to use a practical expedient of Topic 606 and treat such shipping activities as fulfillment costs, thereby recognizing revenues at the time of shipment.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had total borrowings under the Credit Facility of $170.8 million and we could borrow up to $571.5 million and remain in compliance with the debt covenants under the Company's credit facility. At February 14, 2019, we had $483.3 million of available borrowings under our Credit Facility, net of a $7.7 million outstanding letter of credit.\nInflation\nIn accordance with ASC 740, the Company recognizes the effect of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not (a likelihood of greater than 50%) that such position will be sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company recognizes both interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in net other income (expense).\n\nTotal Revenues. Our total revenues were $1.03 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to approximately $978.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $51.9 million, or 5.3%. Revenues for our reportable segments and non-segmented other revenues are further discussed below.\nIn addition to long-lived fixed assets, we also acquire other assets and assume liabilities. These other assets and liabilities typically include, but are not limited to, parts inventory, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other working capital items. Because of their short-term nature, the fair values of these assets and liabilities generally approximate the carrying values reflected on the acquired entities balance sheets. However, when appropriate, we adjust these carrying values for factors such as collectibility and existence. The intangible assets that we have acquired generally consist primarily of the goodwill recognized. Depending upon the applicable purchase agreement and the particular facts and circumstances of the business acquired, we may identify other intangible assets, such as trade names or trademarks, non-compete agreements and customer-related intangibles (specifically, customer relationships). A trademark has a fair value equal to the present value of the royalty income attributable to it. The royalty income attributable to a trademark represents the hypothetical cost savings that are derived from owning the trademark instead of paying royalties to license the trademark from another owner. When specifically negotiated by the parties in the applicable purchase\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts that reflects our estimate of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect. We develop our estimate of this allowance based on our historical experience with specific customers, our understanding of our current economic circumstances and our own judgment as to the likelihood of ultimate payment. Our largest exposure to doubtful accounts is in our rental operations. We perform credit evaluations of customers and establish credit limits based on reviews of our customers' current credit information and payment histories. We believe our credit risk is somewhat mitigated by our geographically diverse customer base and our credit evaluation procedures. During the year, we write-off customer account balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote. Such write-offs are charged against our allowance for doubtful accounts. Bad debt expense as a percentage of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were approximately 0.2%, 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively. The actual rate of future credit losses, however, may not be similar to past experience. Our estimate of doubtful accounts could change based on changing circumstances, including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers. Accordingly, we may be required to increase or decrease our allowance for doubtful accounts. See also Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements regarding pending a pending accounting pronouncement related to estimating credit losses.\nNew Equipment Sales Gross Profit. Our new equipment sales gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $8.3 million, or 36.7%, to $30.9 million compared to $22.6 million in 2017 on an increase in total new equipment sales of $59.6 million. Gross profit margin on new equipment sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately 11.7%, an increase of 0.6% from 11.1% in 2017, as a result of higher new crane and aerial work platform sales gross margins and the mix of new equipment sold.\n\nWe cannot provide absolute assurance that our future cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our long-term obligations and commitments. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities in the future to service our indebtedness and to meet our other commitments, we will be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness, selling material assets or operations or seeking to raise additional debt or equity capital. Given current economic and market conditions, including the significant disruptions in the global capital markets, we cannot assure investors that any of these actions could be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms or at all, or that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements. In addition, our existing debt agreements, including the Credit Facility and the indenture governing the New Notes and the Add-on Notes, as well as any future debt agreements, contain or may contain restrictive covenants, which may prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt.\nServices Revenues. Our services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $0.6 million, or 1.0%, to $63.5 million from $62.9 million in the same period last year. The increase in services revenues was primarily due to services revenues from our CEC and Rental Inc. locations.\n \u2022 Adverse weather. Adverse weather in a geographic region in which we operate may depress demand for equipment in that region. Our equipment is primarily used outdoors and, as a result, prolonged adverse weather conditions may prohibit our customers from continuing their work projects. Adverse weather also has a seasonal impact in parts of our Intermountain region, particularly in the winter months. \n</table>\nMerger Costs (net of Merger Breakup Fee Proceeds). Pursuant to the terms of our terminated 2017 merger agreement with Neff Corporation ( Neff\u201d), we received a $13.2 million breakup fee concurrently with Neff's termination of the merger agreement in the third quarter of 2017. Related estimated merger transaction fees related to Neff and other acquisition-related activity for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $6.7 million, resulting in estimated net proceeds of $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nItem 7.\nWe are also subject to federal and state income taxes. Future income tax examinations by state and federal agencies could result in additional income tax expense based on probable outcomes of such matters.\nUsed equipment sales: Revenues from the sales of used equipment are recognized at the time of delivery to, or pick-up by, the customer, which is when the customer obtains control of the promised good.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, cash provided by our financing activities was $129.8 million. Net borrowings under our Credit Facility for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $170.8 million, which was partially offset by dividends paid totaling $39.3 million, or $1.10 per common share, treasury stock purchases totaling approximately $1.4 million, payments on capital lease obligations of $0.2 million and payments of deferred financing costs of $0.1 million.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. As more fully described in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we recorded a one-time loss on the early extinguishment of debt in the year ended December 31, 2017 of approximately $25.4 million, reflecting payment of $12.8 million of tender premiums associated with our repurchase of the Old Notes and $10.5 million of premiums in accordance with the indenture governing the Old Notes to redeem the remaining untendered Old Notes, combined with the write off of approximately $2.0 million of unamortized note premium, unaccreted note discount and unamortized deferred financing costs, in each case, related to the Old Notes.\nThe 2017 income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was the result of the Act being signed into law on December 22, 2017. Under ASC 740, the effects of changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which the new legislation is enacted. With respect to U.S. federal income taxes, the enactment date is the date the bill becomes law (i.e. upon presidential signature). Therefore, we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 a one-time decrease in income tax expense of $66.9 million from the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the decrease in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% under the Act. Our accounting for the income tax effects of the Act has been completed.\nParts Sales Gross Profit. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our parts sales revenue gross profit decreased $0.5 million, or 1.7%, to $29.7 million from $30.2 million for the same period in 2016 on a $1.8 million decrease in parts sales revenues. Gross profit margin on parts sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 27.6%, a decrease of 0.1% from 27.7% in the same period in 2016, as a result of the mix of parts sold.\nParts Sales. Cost of parts sales represents costs attributable to the sale of parts directly to customers.\nAlthough we cannot accurately anticipate the effect of inflation on our operations, we believe that inflation has not had for the three most recent fiscal years ended, and is not likely in the foreseeable future to have, a material impact on our results of operations.\nUseful Lives of Rental Equipment and Property and Equipment. We depreciate rental equipment and property and equipment over their estimated useful lives (generally three to ten years), after giving effect to an estimated salvage value ranging from 0% to 25% of cost. The useful life of rental equipment is determined based on our estimate of the period the asset will generate revenues, and the salvage value is determined based on our estimate of the minimum value we could realize from the asset after such period. We periodically review the assumptions utilized in computing rates of depreciation. We may be required to change these estimates based on changes in our industry or other changing circumstances. If these estimates change in the future, we may be required to recognize increased or decreased depreciation expense for these assets.\n (1) Future interest payments are calculated based on the assumption that all debt remains outstanding until maturity. Interest on the Credit Facility assumes the interest rate in effect at December 31, 2018 and includes unused commitment fees. \nEffective January 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Contractors Equipment Center, a privately-held company focused on non-residential construction equipment rentals serving the greater Denver, Colorado area out of three branch locations. Effective April 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Rental, Inc., an equipment rental and distribution company with five branch locations in Alabama and Florida. Effective February 1, 2019, we completed the acquisition of We-Rent-It, an equipment rental company with six branch locations in Central Texas.\nTotal Revenues. Our total revenues were $1.24 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $1.03 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $208.9 million, or 20.3%. Revenues increased for all of our reportable segments and non-segmented other revenues and are further discussed below.\nSenior Secured Credit Facility\nPurchase Price Allocation. We have made significant acquisitions in the past and we intend to make additional acquisitions in the future that meet our selection criteria that solidify our presence in the contiguous regions where we operate with an objective of increasing our revenues, improving our profitability, entering additional attractive markets and strengthening our competitive position. Pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 350 ( ASC 350\u201d), Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, we record as goodwill the excess of the consideration transferred plus the fair value of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired. Such fair market value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by various factors over time, which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates.\nPursuant to registration rights agreements entered into among us, the guarantors of the New Notes and the Add-On Notes, respectively, and the initial purchasers of the New Notes and the Add-On Notes, respectively, we agreed to make offers to exchange (collectively, the Exchange Offer\u201d) the New Notes and Add-On Notes and the respective guarantees for registered, publicly tradable notes and guarantees that have terms identical in all material respects to the New Notes and the Add-On Notes, respectively (except that the exchange notes do not contain any transfer restrictions) within a certain period of time following the completion of the respective note offerings. We completed the Exchange Offer for the New Notes and the Add-On Notes in March 2018.\nTotal Gross Profit. Our total gross profit was $438.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $359.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $78.6 million, or 21.8%. Total gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately 35.4%, an increase of 0.5% from the 34.9% gross profit margin for the same period in 2017. Gross profit and gross margin for all reportable segments and non-segmented other revenues are further described below.\nNew Equipment Sales Revenues. Our new equipment sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $59.6 million, or 29.3%, to $262.9 million from $203.3 million in 2017. This increase, as noted below, was driven primarily by increased sales of new cranes and aerial work platform equipment, combined with the new equipment sales revenues from our Rental Inc. locations.\nRental Depreciation. Depreciation of rental equipment represents the depreciation costs attributable to rental equipment. Estimated useful lives vary based upon type of equipment. Generally, we depreciate cranes and aerial work platforms over a ten year estimated useful life, earthmoving over a five year estimated useful life with a 25% salvage value, and industrial lift trucks over a seven year estimated useful life. Attachments and other smaller type equipment are depreciated over a three year estimated useful life. We periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives assigned to rental equipment.\nAs a percentage of total revenues, SG&A expenses were 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 22.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of 0.1%.\nThe New Notes were issued at par and require semiannual interest payments on March 1st and September 1st of each year, commencing on March 1, 2018. No principal payments are due until maturity (September 1, 2025).\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nAs of December 31, 2018, our goodwill was comprised of the following carrying values for our six reporting units (amounts in thousands):\nWe and our subsidiaries are parties to a $750.0 million Credit Facility with Wells Fargo Capital Finance, LLC (as successor to General Electric Company, successor-by-merger to General Electric Capital Corporation Capital Corporation) as Agent, and the lenders named therein.\nTo service our debt, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness (including the New Notes and the Add-on Notes, the Credit Facility and our other indebtedness), will depend upon our future operating performance and the availability of borrowings under the Credit Facility and/or other debt and equity financing alternatives available to us, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and conditions in the global credit and capital markets, as well as financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Based on our current level of operations and given the current state of the capital markets, we believe our cash flow from operations, available cash and available borrowings under the Credit Facility will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. As of February 14, 2019, we had $483.3 million of available borrowings under the Credit Facility, net of a $7.7 million outstanding letter of credit.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses:\nOn December 22, 2017, we amended, extended and restated the Credit Facility by entering into the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\u201d) by and among the Company, Great Northern Equipment, Inc., H&E Equipment Services (California), LLC, H&E Equipment Services (Mid-Atlantic), LLC, the other credit parties named therein, the lenders named therein, Wells Fargo Capital Finance, LLC, as administrative agent, the other credit parties named therein, the lenders named therein, and the joint lead arrangers, joint book runners, co-syndication agents and documentation agent named therein.\nDetermining the optimal age and mix for our rental fleet equipment is subjective and requires considerable estimates and judgments by management. We constantly evaluate the mix, age and quality of the equipment in our rental fleet in response to current economic and market conditions, competition and customer demand. The mix and age of our rental fleet, as well as our cash flows, are impacted by sales of equipment from the rental fleet, which are influenced by used equipment pricing at the retail and secondary auction market levels, and the capital expenditures to acquire new rental fleet equipment. In making equipment acquisition decisions, we evaluate current economic and market conditions, competition, manufacturers' availability, pricing and return on investment over the estimated useful life of the specific equipment, among other things. As a result of our in-house service capabilities and extensive maintenance program, we believe our rental fleet is well-maintained.\nBased on available evidence, both positive and negative, we believe it is more likely than not that our federal deferred tax assets at December 31, 2018 are fully realizable through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income, and are not subject to any limitations. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we decreased our valuation allowance by $0.1 million for certain state net operating losses that were utilized.\nGross Profit.\nFor purposes of the sensitivity analysis above, we elected not to decrease the useful lives of other equipment, which are primarily three-year estimated useful life assets; rather, we have held the depreciation expense constant at the actual amount of depreciation expense. We believe that decreasing the life of the other equipment by two years is an unreasonable estimate and would potentially lead to the decision to expense, rather than capitalize, a significant portion of the subject asset class. In general terms, a one-year increase in the estimated life across all classes of our rental equipment will give rise to an approximate decrease in our annual depreciation expense of approximately $27.3 million. Additionally, a one-year decrease in the estimated life across all classes of our rental equipment (with the exception of other equipment as discussed above) will give rise to an approximate increase in our annual depreciation expense of approximately $22.2 million.\n \u2022 Regional and Industry-Specific Activity and Trends. Expenditures by our customers may be impacted by the overall level of construction activity in the markets and regions in which they operate, the price of oil and other commodities and other general economic trends impacting the industries in which our customers and end users operate. As our customers adjust their activity and spending levels in response to these external factors, our rentals and sales of equipment to those customers will be impacted. For example, high levels of industrial activity in our Gulf Coast and Intermountain regions have been a meaningful driver of recent growth in our revenues. However, the decline in oil and natural gas prices and the related downturn in oil industry activities during fiscal years 2014, 2015 and 2016 resulted in a significant decrease in our new equipment sales, primarily the sale of new cranes, due to lower demand. Although oil prices have subsequently stabilized and improved in 2017 and into 2018, prices decreased significantly at the end of 2018 into early 2019 and we believe the uncertainty regarding future oil prices continues to impact customer capital expenditure decisions. \nAs of December 31, 2018, we had standby letters of credit issued under our Credit Facility totaling $7.7 million that expire in May 2019. The Company expects to renew those letters of credit under similar terms upon their expiration.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by our investing activities was exceeded by cash used in our investing activities, resulting in net cash used in our investing activities of approximately $153.1 million. This was a result of purchases of rental and non-rental equipment totaling $256.7 million, which was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of rental and non-rental equipment of approximately $103.6 million.\nDuring 2017 and 2018, we performed, as of October 1 of each respective year, a qualitative assessment and determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units is not less than its carrying value and, therefore, did not perform the prescribed two-step goodwill impairment test. We considered various factors in performing the qualitative test, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, the overall financial performance of our reporting units, the Company's stock price and the excess amount or cushion\u201d between our reporting unit's fair value and carrying value as indicated on our most recent quantitative assessment. Based upon improving macroeconomic conditions, positive trends within our industry and market and continuing positive operating results in comparison to prior periods and our internal forecasts, as well as consideration of the cushion between the reporting unit's fair value and carrying value from our prior quantitative analysis, we determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units exceeds their respective carrying values at the October 1, 2017 and 2018 valuation dates and there was no goodwill impairment at October 1, 2017 or 2018.\nWe are subject to a number of external factors that may adversely affect our businesses. These factors, and other factors, are discussed below and under the heading Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d and in Item 1A - Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAnother significant assumption used in our calculation of depreciation expense is the estimated salvage value assigned to our earthmoving equipment. Based on our recent experience, we have used a 25% factor of the equipment's original cost to estimate its salvage value. This factor is highly subjective and subject to change in the future based upon actual results at the time we dispose of the equipment. A change of 5%, either increase or decrease, in the estimated salvage value would result in a change in our annual depreciation expense of approximately $3.2 million.\nFor purposes of performing the first step of the impairment test described above, we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis and/or by applying various market multiples. The principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis are our internal projected results of operations, weighted average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d) and terminal value assumptions.\nGross Profit.\nCost of Revenues:\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. We recorded a one-time loss on the early extinguishment of debt in the three month period ended September 30, 2017 of approximately $25.4 million, reflecting payment of $12.8 million of tender premiums associated with our repurchase of the Old Notes and $10.5 million of premiums in accordance with the indenture governing the Old Notes to redeem the remaining untendered Old Notes, combined with the write off of approximately $2.0 million of unamortized note premium, unaccreted note discount and unamortized deferred financing costs, related to the Old Notes\nPrincipal Costs and Expenses\n \u2022 Used Equipment Sales. Our used equipment sales are generated primarily from sales of used equipment from our rental fleet, as well as from sales of inventoried equipment that we acquire through trade-ins from our equipment customers and through selective purchases of high quality used equipment. Used equipment is sold by our dedicated retail sales force. Our used equipment sales are an effective way for us to manage the size and composition of our rental fleet and provide a profitable distribution channel for disposal of rental equipment. \nServices revenues: We derive our services primarily from maintenance and repair services to customers for their owned equipment. We recognize services revenues at the time such services are completed, which is when the customer obtains control of the promised service.\nBackground\nThe equipment that we sell, rent and service is principally used in the construction industry, as well as by companies for commercial and industrial uses such as plant maintenance and turnarounds, as well as in the petrochemical and energy sectors. As a result, our total revenues are affected by several factors including, but not limited to, the demand for and availability of rental equipment, rental rates and other competitive factors, the demand for new and used equipment, the level of construction and industrial activities, spending levels by our customers, adverse weather conditions and general economic conditions. For a discussion of the impact of seasonality on our revenues, see Seasonality\u201d below.\nOn November 22, 2017, we closed on an offering of $200 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior notes due 2025 (the Add-on Notes\u201d) in an unregistered offering through a private placement. The Add-on Notes were priced at 104.25% of the principal amount. Net proceeds from the offering of the Add-on Notes, including accrued interest from August 24, 2017 totaled approximately $209.2 million. The net proceeds of the offering, was used to repay indebtedness outstanding under the Company's existing senior secured credit facility (the Credit Facility\u201d) and for the payment of fees and expenses related to the offering. The remainder of the net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes and to fund potential acquisitions in connection with our ongoing strategy of acquiring rental companies to complement our existing business and footprint.\nSales of used aerial work platform equipment increased $24.8 million while sales of used other equipment and used cranes increased $2.4 million and $1.5 million, respectively. Partially offsetting these increases in used equipment sales were a $9.6 million decrease in used earthmoving equipment sales and a $1.8 million decrease in used lift truck sales. The product line used equipment sales revenue fluctuations above do not include the impact of legacy CEC and Rental Inc. used equipment sales revenues by product line for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, respectively.\nThe First Amendment, among other things, (i) extends the maturity date of the credit facility from December 22, 2022 to February 1, 2024, and (ii) lowers the interest rate in the case of LIBOR revolving loans, to LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 1.25% to 1.75%, depending on the Average Availability and (iii) lowers the interest rate in the case of Base Rate loans, to the Base Rate (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin of 0.25% to 0.75%, depending on the Average Availability.\nYou can read more about our business segments in note 18 of the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nA substantial portion of our overall value is in our rental fleet equipment. The net book value of our rental equipment at December 31, 2018 was $1.14 billion, or approximately 66.1% of our total assets. Our rental fleet as of December 31, 2018 consisted of 40,542 units having an original acquisition cost (which we define as the cost originally paid to manufacturers or the original amount financed under any operating leases) of approximately $1.76 billion. As of December 31, 2018, our rental fleet composition was as follows (dollars in millions):\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n (5) Represents amounts due on manufacturer flooring plans payable, which are used to finance certain purchases of new equipment inventory and rental equipment. \nNon-Segmented Other Revenues Gross Profit. Our non-segmented other revenues gross loss was approximately $1 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to a gross loss of $0.6 million for the same period last year, a decrease of $0.6 million. Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 0.0% compared to a gross margin of (1.0)% in 2017, an improvement of 1.0%, primarily reflective of improved gross margins on hauling and transportation related charges in the current period and improved gross margin on damage waiver income.\nIn the normal course of our business activities, we may lease real estate, rental equipment and non-rental equipment under operating leases. See Contractual and Commercial Commitments\u201d below.\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including: the identification of reporting units; assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units; assignment of goodwill to reporting units; determination of the fair value of each reporting unit; and an assumption as to the form of the transaction in which the reporting unit would be acquired by a market participant (either a taxable or nontaxable transaction). Impairment of goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment (i.e., before aggregation or combination), or one level below an operating segment (i.e., a component). A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. Pursuant to ASC 350 and ASC 280, Segment Reporting, and other relevant guidance, we have identified two components within our Rental operating segment (Equipment Rentals Component 1 and Equipment Rentals Component 2) and have determined that each of our other four operating segments (New Equipment, Used Equipment, Parts, and Service segments) represents a reporting unit, resulting in six total reporting units.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A expenses increased $4.7 million, or 2.0%, to $232.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $228.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in SG&A expenses was attributable to several factors. Employee salaries, wages, payroll taxes, employee benefit expenses and other employee costs increased approximately $7.6 million, primarily as a result of a larger workforce compared to the same period last year, an increase in incentive compensation associated with our increase in current year revenues, and higher employer health insurance costs. Facility costs increased $1.6 million, comprised primarily of additional rent expense related to new branches opened since the fourth quarter of last year. Bad debt expense increased $0.9 million, while supplies expense and other general corporate overhead expenses increased $0.5 million. Partially offsetting these increases was a $4.1 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense due to lower software amortization costs. Legal, professional and other service fees decreased $1.1 million. General liability insurance costs decreased $0.7 million.\nServices Support. Cost of services revenues represents costs attributable to service provided for the maintenance and repair of customer-owned equipment and equipment then on-rent by customers.\nTotal Gross Profit. Our total gross profit was $359.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $335.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $24.3 million, or 7.2%. Total gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately 34.9%, an increase of 0.6% from the 34.3% gross profit margin for the same period in 2016. Gross profit and gross margin for all reportable segments and non-segmented other revenues are further described below.\nRental equipment dollar utilization (annual rental revenues divided by the average original rental fleet equipment costs) for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased 0.9% to 35.8% from 34.9% in 2017. The increase in comparative rental equipment dollar utilization was primarily the result of the increase in equipment rental rates, combined with the mix of equipment rented, which was partially offset by a decrease in rental equipment time utilization. Rental equipment time utilization as a percentage of original equipment cost was approximately 71.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 72.1% in the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of 0.5%.\nUsed Equipment Sales Revenues. Our used equipment sales increased $17.8 million, or 16.6%, to $125.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, from $107.3 million for the same period in 2017.\nAn off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with the Company.\nWe believe that our integrated business tempers the effects of downturns in a particular segment. For a discussion of seasonality, see Seasonality\u201d on page 47 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The application of many accounting principles requires us to make assumptions, estimates and/or judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These assumptions, estimates and/or judgments, however, are often subjective and they and our actual results may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analyses. If actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts first become known. We believe the following critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions, estimates and/or judgments. See also note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies.\nRevenues.\nServices Revenues. Our services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased $1.8 million, or 2.8%, to $62.9 million from $64.7 million in the same period in 2016. The decrease in services revenues was due to lower crane services revenues and lower other equipment services revenues.\nNon-Segmented Other Revenues Gross Profit. Our non-segmented other revenues gross profit increased approximately $0.6 million to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $0.2 million for the same period in 2016 on a $4.6 million increase in non-segmented other revenues. Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 1.2% compared to a gross margin of 0.3% in the same period 2016, an increase of 0.9%, primarily reflective of improved margins on hauling revenues compared to last year.\nOur internal projected results of operations serve as key inputs for developing our cash flow projections for a planning period of twelve years. Beyond this period, we also determine an assumed long-term growth rate representing the expected rate at which a reporting unit's earnings stream is expected to grow. These rates are used to calculate the terminal value of our reporting units and are added to the cash flows projected during the twelve year planning period. The WACC is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise and represents the expected cost of new capital likely to be used by market participants. The WACC is used to discount our combined future cash flows.\nPrior to our initial public offering in February 2006, our business was conducted through H&E LLC. In connection with our initial public offering, we converted H&E LLC into H&E Equipment Services, Inc. In order to have an operating Delaware corporation as the issuer for our initial public offering, H&E Equipment Services, Inc. was formed as a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of H&E Holdings L.L.C. ( H&E Holdings\u201d), and immediately prior to the closing of our initial public offering, on February 3, 2006, H&E LLC and H&E Holdings merged with and into H&E Equipment Services, Inc., which survived the reincorporation merger as the operating company. Effective February 3, 2006, H&E LLC and H&E Holdings no longer existed under operation of law pursuant to the reincorporation merger.\n\nInterest expense increased approximately $8.7 million to $63.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $55.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in interest expense was due to additional interest costs of $7.2 million associated with the upsize of our $950 million 5.625% senior unsecured notes that were issued in the third and fourth quarters of 2017 compared to our $630 million 7% senior unsecured notes, which were retired in the third quarter of 2017. Interest costs related to the Credit Facility increased $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period last year.\nRevenues.\nOur average rental rates for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased 2.1% compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Our average rental rates for the year ended December 31, 2018 do not include rental rate data for legacy CEC and Rental Inc. for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, respectively.\nWe have five reportable segments because we derive our revenues from five principal business activities: (1) equipment rentals; (2) new equipment sales; (3) used equipment sales; (4) parts sales; and (5) repair and maintenance services. These segments are based upon how we allocate resources and assess performance. In addition, we also have non-segmented revenues and costs that relate to equipment support activities.\nThe inputs and variables used in determining the fair value of a reporting unit require management to make certain assumptions regarding the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes, as well as estimates of future cash flows. Our estimates regarding future cash flows are based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance, including revenues, margins and operating expenses. These estimates involve risk and are inherently uncertain. Changes in our estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or the amount of goodwill impairment to be recognized. However, we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and represent our most likely future operating results based upon current information available. Future deterioration in the macroeconomic environment, adverse changes within our industry, further deterioration in our common stock price, downward revisions to our projected cash flows based on new information, or other factors, some of which are beyond our ability to control, could result in a future impairment charge that could materially impact our future results of operations and financial position in the reporting period identified.\nRental Expense. Rental expense represents the costs associated with rental equipment, including, among other things, the cost of servicing and maintaining our rental equipment, property taxes on our fleet and other miscellaneous costs of rental equipment.\nRevenue Recognition. Upon our adoption of Topic 606 on January 1, 2018, we recognize revenue in accordance with two applicable accounting standards: 1) Topic 606 and 2) Topic 840 (which addresses lease accounting). Topic 606 superseded Topic 605 and other legacy industry-specific revenue recognition guidance.\nOur U.S. federal tax returns for 2015 and subsequent years remain subject to examination by tax authorities. We are also subject to examination in various state jurisdictions for 2013 and subsequent years.\nUsed Equipment Sales Gross Profit. Our used equipment sales gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased approximately $5.9 million, or 17.7%, to $39.1 million from $33.2 million in 2017 on a used equipment sales increase of $17.8 million. Gross profit margin on used equipment sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 31.2%, up 0.3% from 30.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of the mix of used equipment sold and higher used equipment margins on used aerial work platform equipment sales. These improved gross margins were partially offset by lower margins on sales of CEC and Rental Inc. used equipment, reflecting the purchase accounting fair value step up basis adjustment applied to the acquired used equipment inventory and rental equipment.\nOn February 1, 2019, we further amended and extended the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with the First Amendment to the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the First Amendment\u201d) by and among the Company, Great Northern Equipment, Inc., H&E Equipment Services (California), LLC, H&E Equipment Services (Mid-Atlantic), LLC, the other credit parties named therein, the lenders named therein, Wells Fargo Capital Finance, LLC, as administrative agent, the other credit parties named therein, the lenders named therein, and the joint lead arrangers, joint book runners, co-syndication agents and documentation agent named therein.\nEquipment Rentals. Our rental operation primarily rents our four core types of construction and industrial equipment. We have a well-maintained rental fleet and our own dedicated sales force, focused by equipment type. We actively manage the size, quality, age and composition of our rental fleet based on our analysis of key measures such as time utilization (which we analyze as equipment usage based on: (1) a percentage of original equipment cost, and (2) the number of rental equipment units available for rent), rental rate trends and targets, rental equipment dollar utilization and maintenance and repair costs, which we closely monitor. We maintain fleet quality through regional quality control managers and our parts and services operations.\nThe tables included in the period-to-period comparisons below provide summaries of our revenues and gross profits for our business segments and non-segmented revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. The period-to-period comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nIncome Taxes. The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return with its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company is a C-Corporation under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. We utilize the asset and liability approach to measure deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences existing at each balance sheet date using currently enacted tax rates in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740\u201d). ASC 740 takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rate is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date of that tax rate.\nThe New Notes rank equally in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness and rank senior to any of our subordinated indebtedness. The New Notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by all of our current and future significant domestic restricted subsidiaries. In addition, the New Notes are effectively subordinated to all of our and the guarantors' existing and future secured indebtedness, including the Credit Facility, to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness, and are structurally subordinated to all of the liabilities and preferred stock of any of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the New Notes.\nOur contractual obligations and commercial commitments principally include obligations associated with our outstanding indebtedness and interest payments as of December 31, 2018.\nThe amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including general economic conditions and growth prospects. Our gross rental fleet capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2018 were approximately $440.9 million, including $24.3 million of non-cash transfers from new and used equipment to rental fleet inventory. Our gross property and equipment capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $35.0 million. In response to changing economic conditions, we believe we have the flexibility to modify our capital expenditures by adjusting them (either up or down) to match our actual performance.\nParts Sales Revenues. Our parts sales revenues decreased approximately $1.8 million, or 1.6%, to $107.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $109.1 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease in parts revenues was driven primarily by lower crane parts sales revenues.\nEquipment Rentals Gross Profit. Our gross profit from equipment rentals for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $62.4 million, or 26.9%, to approximately $294.2 million from $231.9 million in 2017.\nRental Fleet\nEffective January 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Contractors Equipment Center, a privately-held company focused on non-residential construction equipment rentals serving the greater Denver, Colorado area out of three branch locations. Effective April 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Rental, Inc., a privately-held equipment rental and distribution company with five branch locations in Alabama and Florida. Effective February 1, 2019, we completed the acquisition of We-Rent-It, a privately-held equipment rental company with six branch locations in Central Texas.\nServices Revenues Gross Profit. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our services revenues gross profit increased $0.4 million, or 1.0%, to $42.2 million from $41.8 million for the same period in 2017 on a $0.6 million increase in services revenues. Gross profit margin on services revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was 66.4%.\nServices Revenues Gross Profit. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our services revenues gross profit decreased approximately $1.1 million, or 2.5%, to $41.8 million from $42.8 million for the same period in 2016 on a $1.8 million decrease in services revenues. Gross profit margin on services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 66.4%, up 0.2% from 66.2% in the same period in 2016, as a result of services revenues mix.\nThe following discussion summarizes the financial position of H&E Equipment Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2018, and its results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018, and should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties (see discussion of Forward-Looking Statements\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those factors set forth under Item 1A - Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Company intends to continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends; however, the declaration of any subsequent dividends is discretionary and will be subject to a final determination by the Board of Directors each quarter after its review of, among other things, business and market conditions.\nGain on Sales of Property and Equipment, Net. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold a parcel of company-owned land and realized a gain of approximately $3.7 million, resulting in total net gains on sales of property and equipment of $7.1 million for the period, compared to $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $2.1 million.\n \u2022 Parts Sales. Our parts business sells new and used parts for the equipment we sell and also provides parts to our own rental fleet. To a lesser degree, we also sell parts for equipment produced by manufacturers whose products we neither rent nor sell. In order to provide timely parts and services support to our customers as well as our own rental fleet, we maintain an extensive parts inventory. \nUnder Topic 606, revenue from contracts with customers is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract with the customer and excludes any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. We recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for such products or services.\nContractual and Commercial Commitments\nIf the two-step goodwill test must be performed, we determine whether the fair value of our goodwill reporting units is greater than their carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired. However, if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then the second step of the impairment test is performed to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we record an impairment loss for the excess amount. See also the Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d discussion in note 2 to these consolidated financial statements for new pending accounting guidance, which removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test.\nWe generate cash primarily from our operating activities and, historically, we have used cash flows from operating activities, manufacturer floor plan financings and available borrowings under the Credit Facility as the primary sources of funds to purchase inventory and to fund working capital and capital expenditures, growth and expansion opportunities (see also Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below). Our management of our working capital is closely tied to operating cash flows, as working capital can be significantly impacted by, among other things, our accounts receivable activities, the level of new and used equipment inventories, which may increase or decrease in response to current and expected demand, and the size and timing of our trade accounts payable payment cycles.\nOur non-segmented other revenues for the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K relate to equipment support activities that we provide, such as transportation, hauling, parts freight and damage waivers, and are not generally allocated to reportable segments.\nPrincipal External Factors that Affect our Businesses\nResults of Operations\n\nThe pie charts below illustrate a breakdown of our revenues and gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 by business segment (see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our business segments):\nOur non-segmented revenues and costs for the periods presented in the Annual Report on Form 10-K relate to equipment support activities that we provide, such as transportation, hauling, parts freight and damage waivers, and are not generally allocated to reportable segments.\nGross profit margin on equipment rentals for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately 49.7% compared to 48.4% in 2017, an increase of 1.3%. As a percentage of equipment rental revenues, rental expenses were 15.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 16.2% for the same period last year, a decrease of 1.1%, resulting primarily from the increase in equipment rental revenues. Depreciation expense was 35.2% of equipment rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 35.4% for the same period in 2017, a decrease of 0.2%, primarily as a result of the increase in equipment rental revenues, which was partially offset by the increase in depreciation expense resulting from the purchase accounting fair value step up adjustments on the CEC and Rental Inc. acquired rental fleets, and the mix of our equipment rental fleet.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A expenses increased $45.5 million, or approximately 19.6%, to $278.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $232.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nPrincipal Cash Flows\nThe net increase in SG&A expenses was attributable to several factors. Employee salaries, wages, payroll taxes and related employee benefit and other employee expenses increased $30.8 million, primarily as a result of our CEC and Rental Inc. acquisitions, a larger workforce and higher incentive compensation related to improved profitability. Legal and professional fees increased $3.6 million. Supply costs increased $2.0 million. Utilities costs increased $1.7 million and other facility-related expenses increased $1.8 million. Promotional expenses increased $1.1 million. Liability insurance costs increased $0.9 million. Additionally, our results for the year ended December 31, 2018 also includes $3.3 million of amortization expense associated with the recognition of intangible assets resulting from the CEC and Rental Inc. purchase price allocations.\n (3) This includes a real estate capital lease for which the related liability has been recorded (including interest) at the present value of future minimum lease payments due under the leases. \nOur average rental rates for the year ended December 31, 2018 were approximately 2.1% higher than the year ended December 31, 2017 (see further discussion on rental rates in Results of Operations\u201d below).\nInventories. We state our new and used equipment inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value by specific identification. Parts and supplies are stated at the lower of the weighted average cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is considered to be the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable cost of completion, disposal and transportation. We maintain allowances for damaged, slow-moving and unmarketable inventory to reflect the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value. Changes in product demand may affect the value of inventory on hand and may require higher inventory allowances. Uncertainties with respect to inventory valuation are inherent in the preparation of financial statements.\nEquipment Rentals Gross Profit. Our gross profit from equipment rentals for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $20.7 million, or 9.8%, to approximately $231.9 million from $211.1 million in 2016. The increase in equipment rentals gross profit was the result of a $33.8 million increase in rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was partially offset by a $7.l million increase in equipment rental depreciation expense and a $6.0 million increase in rental expenses. The increase in rental expenses is primarily due to higher repair costs and increased property taxes resulting from a larger rental fleet size. The increase in rental equipment depreciation expense is largely due also to a larger rental fleet size. Gross profit margin on equipment rentals for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately 48.4% compared to 47.4% for the same period in 2016, an increase of 1.0%. Depreciation expense was 35.4% of equipment rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 36.5% for the same period in 2016, a decrease of 1.1%. As a percentage of equipment rental revenues, rental expenses were 16.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to approximately 16.1% for the same period in 2016, an increase of 0.1%.\nThe original acquisition cost of our gross rental fleet increased by approximately $361.0 million, or 25.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, largely reflective of the CEC and Rental Inc. acquired fleets, combined with increase in 2018 rental capital expenditures to meet customer demand. The average age of our rental fleet equipment decreased by approximately 0.1 months for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nGoodwill. We have made acquisitions in the past that resulted in the recognition of goodwill. Pursuant to ASC 350, goodwill is the excess of the consideration transferred plus the fair value of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if triggering events occur or other impairment indicators arise which might impair recoverability.\nAcquisitions and Start-up Facilities\nBranches opened since January 1, 2016 with less than twelve full months of comparable operations in 2016 and 2017 contributed $3.6 million to the increase in our SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016.\nNon-Segmented Other Revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our other revenues were $74.8 million, an increase of approximately $11.5 million, or 18.2%, from $63.2 million in 2017. This increase was primarily driven by higher hauling revenues and damage waiver income associated with our equipment rental activities, combined with non-segmented other revenues from our CEC and Rental Inc. locations.\nPursuant to Topic 840, we accounted, for the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for equipment rental agreements as operating leases and recognized revenue from equipment rentals in the period earned, regardless of the timing of billing to customers. A rental contract includes rates for daily, weekly or monthly use, and rental revenues are earned on a daily basis as rental contracts remain outstanding. Because rental contracts can extend across multiple reporting periods, we record unbilled rental revenues and deferred rental revenues at the end of reporting periods so rental revenues earned is appropriately stated for the periods presented. We recognize revenue for certain ancillary fees we charge customers: to protect the customer against liability for damage to our equipment while on rent; for fuel; and for environmental costs. Revenues from these ancillary fees are recognized in the period earned. Under Topic 840, we present these ancillary fees we charge to customers in other revenues. Effective January 1, 2019, Topic 842 became effective, replacing Topic 840. See also the Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d discussion in note 2 to these consolidated financial statements for further information related to our adoption of Topic 606 on January 1, 2018 and Topic 842, which became effective on January 1, 2019.\nOther Income (Expense). For the year ended December 31, 2018, our net other expenses decreased approximately $16.6 million to $62.0 million compared to $78.6 million for the same period in 2017. Included in Other Income (Expense) for the year ended December 31, 2017 is a $25.4 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt (see Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt\u201d below).\nThe Amended and Restated Credit Agreement continues to provide for, among other things, a $30 million letter of credit sub-facility, and a guaranty by certain of the Company's subsidiaries of the obligations under the Credit Facility. In addition, the Credit Facility remains secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries.\nParts Sales Revenues. Our parts sales revenues increased $6.2 million, or 5.4%, to $120.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $114.3 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in parts sales was largely attributable to increases in crane parts sales, aerial work platform equipment parts sales and earthmoving equipment parts sales, combined with parts sales revenues from our CEC and Rental Inc. locations.\n \u2022 Services. Our services operation provides maintenance and repair services for our customers' equipment and to our own rental fleet at our facilities as well as at our customers' locations. As the authorized distributor for numerous equipment manufacturers, we are able to provide service to that equipment that will be covered under the manufacturer's warranty. \nOn December 22, 2017, the Act was signed into law. Included in the Act is a reduction in the corporate statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective for us as of January 1, 2018. Under ASC 740, the effects of changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which the new legislation is enacted. In the case of U.S. federal income taxes, the enactment date is the date the bill becomes law (i.e., upon presidential signature). We have completed our accounting for all the tax effects of the enactment of the Act.\n\nOur used equipment sales from the rental fleet, which comprised approximately 89.6% and 89.7% of our used equipment sales for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were approximately 152.1% and 149.6% of net book value for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nOur non-segmented other expenses for the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include costs associated with providing transportation, hauling, parts freight, and damage waiver including, among other items, drivers' wages, fuel costs, shipping costs, and our costs related to damage waiver policies.\nNew Equipment Sales Gross Profit. Our new equipment sales gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $1.5 million, or 6.9%, to $22.6 million compared to $21.1 million for the same period in 2016 on an increase in total new equipment sales of $6.6 million. Gross profit margin on new equipment sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 11.1%, an increase of 0.4% from 10.7% in the same period in 2016, as a result of the mix of new equipment sold.\n \u2022 Spending levels by customers. Rentals and sales of equipment to the construction industry and to industrial companies constitute a significant portion of our total revenues. As a result, we depend upon customers in these businesses and their ability and willingness to make capital expenditures to rent or buy specialized equipment. Accordingly, our business is impacted by fluctuations in customers' spending levels on capital expenditures and by the availability of credit to those customers. \nThe indenture governing the New Notes contains certain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to: (i) incur additional indebtedness, assume a guarantee or issue preferred stock; (ii) pay dividends or make other equity distributions or payments to or affecting our subsidiaries; (iii) purchase or redeem our capital stock; (iv) make certain investments; (v) create liens; (vi) sell or dispose of assets or engage in mergers or consolidations; (vii) engage in certain transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates; (viii) enter into sale-leaseback transactions; and (ix) engage in certain business activities. Each of the covenants is subject to exceptions and qualifications. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with these covenants.\n \u2022 Equipment Rentals. Our rental operation primarily rents our four core types of construction and industrial equipment. We have a well-maintained rental fleet and our own dedicated sales force, focused by equipment type. We actively manage the size, quality, age and composition of our rental fleet based on our analysis of key measures such as time utilization (which we analyze as equipment usage based on: (1) a percentage of original equipment cost, and (2) the number of rental equipment units available for rent), rental rate trends and targets, rental equipment dollar utilization and maintenance and repair costs, which we closely monitor. We maintain fleet quality through regional quality control managers and our parts and services operations. \nOn August 24, 2017, we completed an offering of $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.6250% senior notes due 2025 (the New Notes\u201d) and the settlement of a cash tender offer (the Tender Offer\u201d) with respect to our 7% senior notes due 2022 (the Old Notes\u201d). Net proceeds, after deducting $10.3 million of estimated offering expenses, from the sale of the New Notes totaled approximately $739.7 million. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the New Notes to repurchase $329.7 million of aggregate principal amount of the Old Notes in early settlement of the Tender Offer, which the Company launched on August 17, 2017. Holders who tendered their Old Notes prior to the early tender deadline received $1,038.90 per $1,000 principal amount of Old Notes tendered, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the payment date of August 24, 2017. Effective as of August 24, 2017, we (i) provided notice of the redemption of all remaining Old Notes that were not validly tendered in the Tender Offer at the expiration time and (ii) satisfied and discharged the indenture governing the Old Notes in accordance with its terms. On September 25, 2017, we redeemed the remaining $300.3 million principal amount outstanding of the Old Notes at a redemption price equal to 103.50% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the date of redemption.\nASC 350 permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not (a likelihood of greater than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case, the currently prescribed two-step goodwill test must be performed. Otherwise, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. Considerable judgment is required by management in using the qualitative approach under ASC 350 to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. ASC 350 suggests that a qualitative assessment may become less relevant over time. In other words, the longer it has been since the last quantitative assessment, the more difficult it could be for a company to conclude that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Our most recent quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment was as of October 1, 2016, whereby we bypassed the qualitative assessment for each reporting unit and proceeded directly to Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test. Our goodwill impairment testing as of that date indicated that there was no impairment among our reporting units as estimated fair values exceeded their respective carrying amounts.\nOther Income (Expense). For the year ended December 31, 2017, our net other expenses increased $26.8 million to $78.6 million, compared to $51.7 million in 2016. Included in Other Income (Expense) for the year ended December 31, 2017 is a $25.4 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt (see discussion immediately below regarding the issuance of the New Notes). Interest expense was $55.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $53.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $1.4 million. The increase in interest expense is primarily related to the timing of the issuance of the New Notes in relation to the redemption of the Old Notes. Our New Notes were issued on August 24, 2017, while approximately $300.3 million of the Old Notes remained outstanding until the September 25, 2017 redemption date. Miscellaneous other income was $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $1.9 million in 2016, a decrease of $0.1 million.\nNew equipment sales: Revenues from the sales of new equipment are recognized at the time of delivery to, or pick-up by, the customer, which is when the customer obtains control of the promised good.\nEquipment sales cycles are also subject to some seasonality with the peak selling period during the spring season and extending through the summer. Parts and services activities are typically less affected by changes in demand caused by seasonality.\nAs a percentage of total revenues, SG&A expenses were 22.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of 0.7% from 23.3% for the same period in 2016, primarily as a result of the increase in 2017 total revenues.\nServices. We derive our services revenues from maintenance and repair services to customers for their owned equipment. In addition to repair and maintenance on an as-needed or scheduled basis, we also provide ongoing preventative maintenance services to industrial customers. Our after-market service provides a high-margin, relatively stable source of revenue through changing economic cycles.\n\nThe accounting for the types of revenues accounted for pursuant to Topic 606 is discussed below. Substantially all of our revenues under Topic 606 are recognized at a point-in-time rather than over time.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nIncome Taxes. We recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $50.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to income tax expense of approximately $21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. On December 22, 2017, the Act was signed into law. Under ASC 740, the effects of changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which the new legislation is enacted. With respect to U.S. federal income taxes, the enactment date is the date the bill becomes law (i.e. upon presidential signature). Therefore, we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 a one-time decrease in income tax expense of $66.9 million from the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the decrease in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% under the Act.\nQuarterly Dividend\nBusiness Segments\nUsed Equipment Sales. Cost of used equipment sold consists of the net book value of rental equipment for used equipment sold from our rental fleet, the equipment costs for used equipment we purchase for sale or the trade-in value of used equipment that we obtain from customers in equipment sales transactions.\nSeasonality\nParts Sales. We generate revenues from the sale of new and used parts for equipment that we rent or sell, as well as for other makes of equipment. Our product support sales representatives are instrumental in generating our parts revenues. They are product specialists and receive performance incentives for achieving certain sales levels. Most of our parts sales come from our extensive in-house parts inventory. Our parts sales provide us with a relatively stable revenue stream that is generally less sensitive to the economic cycles that tend to affect our rental and equipment sales operations.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nApproximately $4.0 million of the total increase in SG&A expenses was attributable to branches opened since January 1, 2017 (but excluding for this purpose branches acquired as a result of our CEC and Rental Inc. acquisitions) with less than a full year of comparable operations in either or both of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nThe New Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time on or after September 1, 2020 at specified redemption prices plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. We may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the New Notes before September 1, 2020 with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings. We may also redeem the New Notes prior to September 1, 2020 at a specified make-whole\u201d redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.\nMerger costs incurred in the year ended December 31, 2018 were approximately $0.7 million.\nThe Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, among other things, (i) extended the maturity date of the credit facility from May 21, 2019 to December 22, 2022, (ii) increased the commitments under the senior secured asset based revolver provided for therein from $602.5 million to $750 million, (iii) increased the uncommitted incremental revolving capacity from $150 million to $250 million, (iv) provided that the unused line fee margin will be either 0.375% or 0.25%, depending on the Average Revolver Usage (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) of the borrowers, (v) lowered the interest rate (a) in the case of base rate revolving loans, to the base rate plus an applicable margin of 0.50% to 1.00% depending on the Average Availability (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) and (b) in the case of LIBOR revolving loans, to LIBOR (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin of 1.50% to 2.00%, depending on the Average Availability, (vi) lowered the margin applicable to the letter of credit fee to between 1.50% and 2.00%, depending on the Average Availability, and (vii) permitted, subject to certain conditions, an unlimited amount of Permitted Acquisitions, Restricted Payments and prepayments of Indebtedness (in each case, as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement).\n (2) As described in further detail elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Credit Facility was amended on February 1, 2019. \nNon-Segmented Other Revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our other revenues were $70.1 million, an increase of approximately $4.6 million, or 7.1%, from $65.5 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in hauling revenues, fuel charges and damage waiver income associated with the increase in our equipment rental activity.\nWe periodically engage in evaluations of potential acquisitions and start-up facilities. We intend to continue to evaluate and pursue, on an opportunistic basis, acquisitions which meet our selection criteria, and we are focused on identifying and acquiring rental companies to complement our existing business, broaden our geographic footprint, and increase our density in existing markets.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our cash provided by our investing activities was exceeded by our cash used in our investing activities, resulting in net cash used in our investing activities of approximately $526.2 million. The acquisitions of CEC and Rental Inc. totaled approximately $196.0 million (net of cash acquired)and purchases of rental and non-rental equipment totaled approximately $451.6 million, which were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of rental and non-rental equipment of approximately $121.3 million.\nagreements, we base the value of non-compete agreements on the amounts assigned to them in the purchase agreements as these amounts represent the amounts negotiated in an arm's length transaction. When not negotiated by the parties in the applicable purchase agreements, the fair value of non-compete agreements is estimated based on an income approach since their values are representative of the current and future revenue and profit erosion protection they provide. Customer relationships are generally valued based on an excess earnings or income approach with consideration to projected cash flows. We use an independent third party valuation firm to assist us with estimating the fair values of our acquired intangible assets.\nInterest Expense:\nLong-lived Assets. Our long-lived assets principally consist of rental equipment and property and equipment. We review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In reviewing for impairment, the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset's recorded value, an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value. The determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of long-lived and intangible assets involves significant estimates and judgment on the part of management. Our estimates and assumptions may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as changes in economic conditions, changes in our business prospects or other changing circumstances.\nCertain Information Concerning Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nMerger Costs (net of Merger Breakup Fee Proceeds). Pursuant to the terms of our terminated merger agreement with Neff, in August 2017 we received a $13.2 million breakup fee concurrently with Neff's termination of the merger agreement. Merger fees related to the proposed Neff merger totaled $6.5 million and estimated merger fees for the year ended December 31, 2017 associated with our acquisition of CEC in January 2018 totaled $0.8 million, resulting in net breakup fees of approximately $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.", "item_7_tables": "Table 132: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year
