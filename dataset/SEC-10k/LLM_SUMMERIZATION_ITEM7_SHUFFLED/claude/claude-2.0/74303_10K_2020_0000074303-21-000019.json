MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nBUSINESS BACKGROUND\nWe are a leading vertically-integrated global manufacturer and distributor of chemical products and a leading U.S. manufacturer of ammunition. Our operations are concentrated in three business segments: Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls, Epoxy and Winchester. All of our business segments are capital intensive manufacturing businesses. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls operating rates are closely tied to the general economy. Each segment has a commodity element to it.\nOur Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment is partially a commodity business where all supplier products are similar and price is the major supplier selection criterion. Pricing for these products is subject to a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control. Our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment produces some of the most widely used chemicals in the world that can be upgraded into a wide variety of downstream chemical products used in many end-markets. Changes in supply/demand, can be abrupt and significant and, given capacity in our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment, can lead to significant changes in our overall profitability.\nThe Epoxy segment consumes some products manufactured by the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment. The Epoxy segment's upstream and midstream products are partially commodity markets. Pricing for these products is subject to a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control. While competitive differentiation exists through downstream customization and product development opportunities, pricing is extremely competitive with a broad range of competitors across the globe.\nWinchester also has a commodity element to its business, but a majority of Winchester ammunition is sold as a branded consumer product where there are opportunities to differentiate certain offerings through innovative new product development and enhanced product performance. While competitive pricing versus other branded ammunition products is important, it is not the only factor in product selection.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND HIGHLIGHTS\nCOVID-19\nThe 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic, and the various governmental, business and consumer responses to this pandemic, significantly impacted our results during 2020. We have taken measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, work with our customers and suppliers to minimize potential disruptions and support our communities during this global pandemic. Our operations are among businesses that have been considered essential\u201d by government and public health authorities. We are following all federal, state and local health department guidelines and the costs associated with these safety procedures were not material. We continue to safely maintain plant operations and focus on business continuity. All Olin manufacturing facilities worldwide continue to operate, with the exception of those undergoing planned maintenance turnarounds.\nThe spread of the pandemic and the associated response has caused significant disruptions in the U.S. and global economies, resulting in the disruption of the supply and demand fundamentals of our Chemicals businesses. The various governmental, business and consumer responses to the pandemic negatively impacted the demand for several of the products produced by our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls and Epoxy businesses resulting in lower volumes and pricing. We are monitoring the changing business environment, volatility and heightened degree of uncertainty resulting from the response to COVID-19. At the current time, we are unable to fully determine its future impact on our business. We continue to work with our customers, employees, suppliers and communities to address the impacts of COVID-19 and we continue to assess possible implications to our business, supply chain and customers, and to take actions in an effort to mitigate adverse consequences.\nWe have initiated several on-going actions that we believe will partially mitigate the impact of economic decline on our financial performance, but also enhance our position, financially and structurally, to take advantage of the eventual global economic recovery. Several of these actions and our liquidity resources are summarized below:\n\u2022In May 2020, we entered into a $1,300.0 million senior secured credit facility (Senior Secured Credit Facility) that amended our existing senior credit facility, which provides additional flexibility under our restrictive compliance covenants. The facility includes a $800.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility, of which we have $799.6 million available to us at December 31, 2020, and a $500.0 million senior secured delayed-draw term loan facility which was fully drawn in October 2020 and used to call a portion of the 9.75% senior notes due 2023.\n\u2022In May 2020, we issued $500.0 million 9.50% senior notes due 2025 (2025 Notes). Proceeds from the 2025 Notes provided additional liquidity and were used for general corporate purposes.\n\u2022During 2020, we amended our Receivables Financing Agreement to expand the borrowing capacity to $250.0 million and had outstanding borrowings of $125.0 million as of December 31, 2020. We also have the ability to increase our accounts receivable factoring arrangements, which ultimately can accelerate the timing of cash receipts and enhance our cash position. The Receivables Financing Agreement and accounts receivable factoring arrangements do not impact our Senior Secured Credit Facility debt ratio covenants.\n\u2022We executed a strategy to improve our working capital and manage our balance sheet to maximize our financial flexibility. During 2020, Olin reduced working capital by approximately $142 million, which included an approximately $67 million investment in working capital to support Lake City operations.\n\u2022During 2020, our capital expenditures were approximately $87 million lower than 2019 and we are forecasting capital spending to be in the $200 million range in 2021, which would be an additional $100 million lower than 2020 levels.\n\u2022As part of our ongoing productivity initiatives to reduce operating costs, during 2020, we reduced overall employee and contractor headcount in our chemicals businesses and corporate functions.\n\u2022During 2020, we suspended the defined contribution plan match on all salaried and non-bargaining hourly employees' contributions.\n\u2022We believe that we have access to both the high-yield debt and equity markets at this time.\nWe still believe there is a high degree of economic uncertainty in the global markets in which we participate and we believe the steps we have taken and will continue to take to enhance our capital structure and liquidity have strengthened our ability to operate through the current conditions.\n2020 Overview\nNet loss was $969.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net loss of $11.3 million for 2019. The decrease in results from the prior year was primarily due to a goodwill impairment charge of $699.8 million and lower Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment results, primarily due to lower pricing and volumes. Partially offsetting these declines were higher Winchester segment results.\nChlor Alkali Products and Vinyls generated segment income of $3.5 million for 2020 compared to $336.7 million for 2019. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment results were lower than in the prior year primarily due to lower pricing, primarily caustic soda and ethylene dichloride (EDC), and lower volumes, primarily caustic soda. These decreases were partially offset by lower costs, including raw materials and operating costs. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment results included depreciation and amortization expense of $451.4 million and $470.4 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nEpoxy reported segment income of $40.8 million for 2020 compared to $53.9 million for 2019. Epoxy segment results were lower than in the prior year primarily due to lower product prices, partially offset by lower raw material costs. Epoxy segment results included depreciation and amortization expense of $90.7 million and $100.1 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOn October 1, 2020, Winchester assumed full management and operational control of the Lake City facility in Independence, MO. The U.S. Army selected Winchester to operate and manage the Lake City facility in September 2019. The contract has an initial term of seven years and may be extended by the U.S. Army for up to three additional years.\nWinchester reported segment income of $92.3 million for 2020 compared to $40.1 million for 2019. The increase in segment results was due to increased sales volumes, which includes ammunition produced at Lake City, and higher product pricing, partially offset by transition costs relating to the Lake City contract and higher operating costs. Winchester segment results included depreciation and amortization expense of $20.1 million in both 2020 and 2019.\nOn October 15, 2020, Olin redeemed $600.0 million of the outstanding 9.75% senior notes due 2023 (2023 Notes). The 2023 Notes were redeemed at 102.438% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes, resulting in a redemption premium of $14.6 million. The 2023 Notes were redeemed by drawing on our $500.0 million senior secured delayed-draw term loan facility (Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility) along with utilizing $114.6 million of cash on hand.\nSubsequent Event\nOn January 15, 2021, Olin redeemed the remaining $120.0 million of the outstanding 2023 Notes. The 2023 Notes were redeemed at 102.438% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes, resulting in a redemption premium of $2.9 million. The remaining 2023 Notes were redeemed by utilizing $122.9 million of cash on hand.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>($ in millions, except per share data) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,758.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,110.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,946.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold </td> <td>5,374.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,439.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,822.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin </td> <td>383.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>670.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,124.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and administration </td> <td>422.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>416.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>430.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring charges </td> <td>9.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition-related costs </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill impairment </td> <td>699.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating income </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating (loss) income </td> <td>(746.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>177.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>676.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Losses of non-consolidated affiliates </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19.7) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td>292.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>243.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>243.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-operating pension income </td> <td>18.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) before taxes </td> <td>(1,020.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(36.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>437.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (benefit) provision </td> <td>(50.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>109.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(969.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(11.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>327.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income per common share: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6.14) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.07) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.97 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6.14) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.07) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.95 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n2020 Compared to 2019\nSales for 2020 were $5,758.0 million compared to $6,110.0 million in 2019, a decrease of $352.0 million, or 6%. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls sales decreased by $460.2 million, primarily due to lower caustic soda and EDC pricing and lower volumes, primarily caustic soda. Epoxy sales decreased by $153.9 million, primarily due to lower product prices. Winchester sales increased by $262.1 million, primarily due to higher commercial and military sales volumes, which included ammunition produced at Lake City, and increased commercial ammunition pricing.\nGross margin decreased $287.4 million, or 43%, from 2019. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls gross margin decreased by $327.2 million, primarily due to lower caustic soda and EDC pricing and lower volumes, partially offset by lower costs, primarily raw materials. Epoxy gross margin decreased $9.5 million, primarily due to lower product prices, partially offset by lower raw material costs. Winchester gross margin increased $73.5 million, primarily due to higher sales volumes, which included ammunition produced at Lake City, and increased commercial pricing. Gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased to 7% in 2020 from 11% in 2019.\nSelling and administration expenses in 2020 increased $5.1 million, or 1%, from 2019. The increase was primarily due to Lake City operations and higher transition costs relating to the Lake City contract of $22.4 million and higher stock-based compensation expense of $14.7 million, which includes mark-to-market adjustments. These increases were partially offset by lower salaries and benefits of $13.9 million, consulting and contract services of $7.9 million and travel-related expenses of $8.1 million. In 2017, we began a multi-year implementation of new enterprise resource planning, manufacturing and engineering systems, and related infrastructure (collectively, the Information Technology Project). Selling and administration expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 included costs associated with the Information Technology Project of $73.9 million and $77.0 million, respectively. Selling and administration expenses as a percentage of sales were 7% in both 2020 and 2019.\nRestructuring charges in 2020 and 2019 were primarily associated with the March 2016 closure of 433,000 tons of chlor alkali capacity across three separate locations. Restructuring charges for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were also associated with the closure of a chlor alkali plant and a VDC production facility, both in Freeport, TX, and included $58.9\nmillion of non-cash impairment charges for equipment and facilities for the year ended December 31, 2019. Restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2019 also included costs associated with permanently closing the ammunition assembly operations at our Geelong, Australia facility in December 2018.\nGoodwill impairment includes non-cash pretax impairment charges of $557.6 million related to the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment and $142.2 million related to the Epoxy segment.\nInterest expense increased by $49.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to a higher level of debt outstanding and higher interest rates. Interest expense included $14.6 million of expense related to the 2023 Notes redemption premium and $5.8 million for write-off of deferred debt issuance costs for financing transactions during 2020. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 included $4.0 million and $17.0 million, respectively, of accretion expense related to the ethylene payment discount. Interest expense was reduced by capitalized interest of $6.4 million and $10.8 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNon-operating pension income includes all components of pension and other postretirement income (costs) other than service costs. Non-operating pension income was higher for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to a decrease in the amortization of actuarial losses associated with our domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan.\nThe effective tax rate for 2020 included expenses associated with a net increase in the valuation allowance related to foreign and domestic tax credits and deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions, a remeasurement of deferred taxes due to an increase in our state effective tax rates and a change in tax contingencies, and stock-based compensation, partially offset by a benefit associated with prior year tax positions. These factors resulted in a net $27.9 million tax expense. For 2020, a tax benefit of $10.8 million was recognized associated with the $699.8 million goodwill impairment charge. After giving consideration to these items, including the goodwill impairment charge on Olin's loss before taxes, the effective tax rate for 2020 of 21.0% was equal to the 21% U.S. federal statutory rate as foreign income taxes, foreign income inclusions and a net increase in the valuation allowance related to losses in foreign jurisdictions were offset by state taxes and favorable permanent salt depletion deductions. The effective tax rate for 2019 included benefits associated with the finalization of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) review of years 2013 to 2015 U.S. income tax claims, stock-based compensation, prior year tax positions, foreign tax law changes, a remeasurement of deferred taxes due to a decrease in our state effective tax rates and a change in tax contingencies. The effective tax rate also included expenses associated with a net increase in the valuation allowance primarily related to foreign deferred tax assets and liabilities. These factors resulted in a net $19.4 million tax benefit. After giving consideration to these items, the effective tax rate for 2019 of 16.8% was lower than the 21% U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state taxes and a net increase in the valuation allowance related to losses in foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by foreign income taxes and favorable permanent salt depletion deductions.\n2019 Compared to 2018\nSales for 2019 were $6,110.0 million compared to $6,946.1 million in 2018, a decrease of $836.1 million, or 12%. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls sales decreased by $566.6 million primarily due to lower caustic soda pricing. Epoxy sales decreased by $278.7 million primarily due to lower product prices and an unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation. Winchester sales increased by $9.2 million primarily due to higher ammunition sales to commercial customers.\nGross margin decreased $453.2 million, or 40%, from 2018. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls gross margin decreased by $342.1 million, primarily due to lower caustic soda pricing, partially offset by lower raw material and operating costs. Epoxy gross margin decreased $20.6 million primarily due to lower product prices, partially offset by lower raw material costs, primarily benzene and propylene, and lower maintenance and unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs associated with maintenance turnarounds. Winchester gross margin increased $1.2 million primarily due to lower costs, partially offset by lower product prices. Gross margin in 2018 was positively impacted by insurance recoveries for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods of $111.0 million. Gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased to 11% in 2019 from 16% in 2018.\nSelling and administration expenses in 2019 decreased $13.7 million, or 3%, from 2018. The years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 included costs associated with the Information Technology Project of $77.0 million and $36.5 million, respectively, an increase of $40.5 million. More than offsetting this increase were lower legal and legal-related settlement expenses of $19.3 million, primarily due to the legal fees associated with the environmental recovery actions in 2018, lower consulting and contract services of $13.7 million, lower management incentive compensation expense of $10.2 million, which includes mark-to-market adjustments on stock-based compensation expense, and a favorable foreign currency impact of $8.5 million. Selling and administration expenses as a percentage of sales were 7% in 2019 and 6% in 2018.\nRestructuring charges in 2019 included $58.9 million of non-cash impairment charges for equipment and facilities associated with the closure of a chlor alkali plant and a VDC production facility, both in Freeport, TX. Restructuring charges in 2019 and 2018 were also associated with the March 2016 closure of 433,000 tons of chlor alkali capacity across three separate locations and the December 2018 decision to permanently close the ammunition assembly operations at our Winchester facility in Geelong, Australia.\nOther operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018 included an $8.0 million insurance recovery for a second quarter 2017 business interruption at our Freeport, TX vinyl chloride monomer facility partially offset by a $1.7 million loss on the sale of land.\nLosses of non-consolidated affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflect a $21.5 million non-cash impairment charge.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was impacted by a lower level of average debt outstanding partially offset by higher interest rates compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 included $17.0 million and $16.0 million, respectively, of accretion expense related to the ethylene payment discount. Interest expense was reduced by capitalized interest of $10.8 million and $6.0 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nNon-operating pension income includes all components of pension and other postretirement income (costs) other than service costs. Non-operating pension income was lower for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation fees associated with our domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan.\nThe effective tax rate for 2019 included benefits associated with the finalization of the IRS review of years 2013 to 2015 U.S. income tax claims, stock-based compensation, prior year tax positions, foreign tax law changes, a remeasurement of deferred taxes due to a decrease in our state effective tax rates and a change in tax contingencies. The effective tax rate also included expenses associated with a net increase in the valuation allowance primarily related to foreign deferred tax assets and liabilities. These factors resulted in a net $19.4 million tax benefit. After giving consideration to these items, the effective tax rate for 2019 of 16.8% was lower than the 21% U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state taxes and a net increase in the valuation allowance related to losses in foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by foreign income taxes and favorable permanent salt depletion deductions. The effective tax rate for 2018 included benefits associated with the U.S. Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (2017 Tax Act), stock-based compensation, changes in tax contingencies, a foreign dividend payment, changes associated with prior year tax positions and the remeasurement of deferred taxes due to a decrease in our state effective tax rates. The effective tax rate also included expenses associated with a net increase in the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions and the remeasurement of deferred taxes due to changes in our foreign tax rates. These factors resulted in a net $2.9 million tax benefit, of which $3.8 million related to the increase of the 2017 Tax Act benefit. After giving consideration to these items, the effective tax rate for 2018 of 25.7% was higher than the 21% U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state and foreign income taxes, foreign income inclusions and a net increase in the valuation allowance related to current year losses in foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by favorable permanent salt depletion deductions.\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nWe define segment results as income (loss) before interest expense, interest income, goodwill impairment charges, other operating income (expense), non-operating pension income, other income and income taxes, and includes the operating results of non-consolidated affiliates. Consistent with the guidance in ASC 280 Segment Reporting,\u201d we have determined it is appropriate to include the operating results of non-consolidated affiliates in the relevant segment financial results. We have three operating segments: Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls, Epoxy and Winchester. The three operating segments reflect the organization used by our management for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. Chlorine used in our Epoxy segment is transferred at cost from the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment. Sales and profits are recognized in the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment for all caustic soda generated and sold by Olin.\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales: </td> <td>($ in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,959.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,420.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,986.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Epoxy </td> <td>1,870.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,024.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,303.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Winchester </td> <td>927.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>665.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>656.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,758.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,110.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,946.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) before taxes: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls(1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>336.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>637.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Epoxy </td> <td>40.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Winchester </td> <td>92.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate/Other: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental (expense) income (2)\n</td> <td>(20.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>103.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other corporate and unallocated costs(3)\n</td> <td>(154.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(156.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(158.3) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring charges(4)\n</td> <td>(9.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(76.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21.9) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition-related costs </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.0) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill impairment </td> <td>(699.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating income(5)\n</td> <td>0.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense(6)\n</td> <td>(292.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(243.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(243.2) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-operating pension income </td> <td>18.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income(7)\n</td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) before taxes </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,020.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(36.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>437.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Losses of non-consolidated affiliates are included in the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment results consistent with management's monitoring of the operating segment. The losses of non-consolidated affiliates were $19.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which reflected a $21.5 million non-cash impairment charge.\n(2)Environmental (expense) income for the year ended December 31, 2019 included $4.8 million of an environmental insurance-related settlement gain. Environmental (expense) income for the year ended December 31, 2018 included pre-tax insurance recoveries for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods of $111.0 million. Environmental (expense) income is included in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations.\n(3)Other corporate and unallocated costs for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 included costs associated with the implementation of the Information Technology Project of $73.9 million, $77.0 million and $36.5 million, respectively.\n(4)Restructuring charges for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 included costs associated with the March 2016 closure of 433,000 tons of chlor alkali capacity across three separate locations. Restructuring charges for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were also associated with the closure of a chlor alkali plant and a VDC production facility, both in Freeport, TX, and included $58.9 million of non-cash impairment charges for equipment and facilities for the year ended December 31, 2019. Restructuring charges for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 also\nincluded costs associated with permanently closing the ammunition assembly operations at our Geelong, Australia facility in December 2018. Restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2018 also included charges associated with permanently closing a portion of the Becancour, Canada chlor alkali facility in 2014.\n(5)Other operating income for the year ended December 31, 2020 included an $0.8 million gain on the sale of land. Other operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018 included an $8.0 million insurance recovery for a second quarter 2017 business interruption at our Freeport, TX vinyl chloride monomer facility partially offset by a $1.7 million loss on the sale of land.\n(6)Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 included $14.6 million of expense related to the 2023 Notes redemption premium and $5.8 million for the write-off of deferred debt issuance costs associated with financing transactions during 2020. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 included $4.0 million, $17.0 million and $16.0 million, respectively, of accretion expense related to the ethylene payment discount. Interest expense was reduced by capitalized interest of $6.4 million, $10.8 million and $6.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n(7)Other income for the year ended December 31, 2019 included a gain of $11.2 million on the sale of our equity interest in a non-consolidated affiliate.\nChlor Alkali Products and Vinyls\n2020 Compared to 2019\nChlor Alkali Products and Vinyls sales for 2020 were $2,959.9 million compared to $3,420.1 million for 2019, a decrease of $460.2 million, or 13%. The sales decrease was primarily due to lower caustic soda and EDC pricing and lower volumes, primarily caustic soda.\nChlor Alkali Products and Vinyls generated segment income of $3.5 million for 2020 compared to $336.7 million for 2019, a decrease of $333.2 million. The decrease in Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment results was primarily due to lower product prices ($318.5 million), primarily caustic soda and EDC, and lower volumes ($143.1 million), primarily caustic soda. Partially offsetting these decreases were lower raw material costs ($83.8 million) and lower maintenance turnaround and operating costs ($44.6 million). Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment results included depreciation and amortization expense of $451.4 million and $470.4 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n2019 Compared to 2018\nChlor Alkali Products and Vinyls sales for 2019 were $3,420.1 million compared to $3,986.7 million for 2018, a decrease of $566.6 million, or 14%. The sales decrease was primarily due to lower product pricing, primarily caustic soda, and lower volumes.\nChlor Alkali Products and Vinyls generated segment income of $336.7 million for 2019 compared to $637.1 million for 2018, a decrease of $300.4 million, or 47%. The decrease in Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment results was primarily due to lower product prices ($449.4 million), primarily caustic soda, and lower volumes ($53.0 million), partially offset by lower raw material and operating costs ($138.1 million) and lower maintenance turnaround costs ($42.4 million). Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls 2018 segment results were also negatively impacted by a non-cash impairment charge associated with our investment in a non-consolidated affiliate ($21.5 million). Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment results included depreciation and amortization expense of $470.4 million and $473.1 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nEpoxy\n2020 Compared to 2019\nEpoxy sales were $1,870.5 million for 2020 compared to $2,024.4 million for 2019, a decrease of $153.9 million, or 8%. The sales decrease was primarily due to lower product prices ($180.0 million) and an unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation ($6.1 million), partially offset by higher volumes ($32.2 million).\nEpoxy reported segment income of $40.8 million for 2020 compared to $53.9 million for 2019, a decrease of $13.1 million, or 24%. The decrease in segment results was primarily due to lower product prices ($180.0 million) and an unfavorable product mix ($24.4 million), partially offset by lower raw material costs ($162.5 million), primarily benzene and\npropylene, and lower operating costs ($38.8 million). Epoxy segment results were also negatively affected by a first quarter 2020 force majeure declaration by a European phenol supplier, which reduced epoxy resin and epoxy resin precursor production, and Epoxy manufacturing plant closures and operating reductions in Asia due to COVID-19 ($10.0 million). A significant percentage of our Euro denominated sales are of products manufactured within Europe. As a result, the impact of foreign currency translation on revenue is primarily offset by the impact of foreign currency translation on raw materials and manufacturing costs also denominated in Euros. Epoxy segment results included depreciation and amortization expense of $90.7 million and $100.1 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n2019 Compared to 2018\nEpoxy sales were $2,024.4 million for 2019 compared to $2,303.1 million for 2018, a decrease of $278.7 million, or 12%. The sales decrease was primarily due to lower product prices ($258.9 million) and an unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation ($62.5 million), partially offset by increased volumes ($42.7 million).\nEpoxy reported segment income of $53.9 million for 2019 compared to $52.8 million for 2018, an increase of $1.1 million, or 2%. The increase in segment results was primarily due to lower maintenance costs and unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs associated with maintenance turnarounds ($40.0 million), decreased operating costs ($18.1 million) and lower raw material costs ($214.1 million), primarily benzene and propylene, partially offset by lower product prices ($258.9 million) and an unfavorable product mix ($12.2 million). A significant percentage of our Euro denominated sales are of products manufactured within Europe. As a result, the impact of foreign currency translation on revenue is primarily offset by the impact of foreign currency translation on raw materials and manufacturing costs also denominated in Euros. Epoxy segment results included depreciation and amortization expense of $100.1 million and $102.4 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWinchester\n2020 Compared to 2019\nWinchester sales were $927.6 million for 2020 compared to $665.5 million for 2019, an increase of $262.1 million, or 39%. The increase was due to higher ammunition sales to commercial customers ($199.2 million) and military customers ($51.9 million), both of which include ammunition produced at Lake City, and law enforcement agencies ($11.0 million).\nWinchester reported segment income of $92.3 million for 2020 compared to $40.1 million for 2019, an increase of $52.2 million, or 130%. The increase in segment results was due to increased sales volumes ($49.2 million), which includes ammunition produced at Lake City, and higher product pricing ($23.4 million), partially offset by higher transition costs relating to the Lake City contract ($12.9 million) and higher operating costs ($7.5 million). Winchester segment results included depreciation and amortization expense of $20.1 million in both 2020 and 2019.\n2019 Compared to 2018\nWinchester sales were $665.5 million for 2019 compared to $656.3 million for 2018, an increase of $9.2 million, or 1%. The sales increase was primarily due to higher ammunition sales to commercial customers ($13.7 million), partially offset by decreased sales to military customers and law enforcement agencies ($4.5 million).\nWinchester reported segment income of $40.1 million for 2019 compared to $38.4 million for 2018, an increase of $1.7 million, or 4%. The increase in segment results was primarily due to lower costs ($8.7 million), primarily commodity and other material costs, partially offset by lower product prices ($6.6 million) and a less favorable product mix ($0.4 million). Winchester segment results included depreciation and amortization expense of $20.1 million and $20.0 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nCorporate/Other\n2020 Compared to 2019\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, charges to income for environmental investigatory and remedial activities were $20.9 million compared to $20.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. These charges related primarily to expected future investigatory and remedial activities associated with past manufacturing operations and former waste disposal sites. The year ended December 31, 2019 includes a $4.8 million environmental insurance-related settlement gain.\nFor 2020, other corporate and unallocated costs were $154.3 million compared to $156.3 million for 2019, a decrease of $2.0 million, or 1%. The decrease was primarily due to lower salary and benefit costs of $12.2 million and lower travel-related expenses of $2.1 million, partially offset by higher stock-based compensation expense of $14.8 million, which includes mark-to-market adjustments. Other corporate and unallocated costs included costs associated with the implementation of the Information Technology Project for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 of $73.9 million and $77.0 million, respectively.\n2019 Compared to 2018\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, net charges to income for environmental investigatory and remedial activities were $20.5 million, which include $4.8 million of an environmental insurance-related settlement gain. For the year ended December 31, 2018, net credits to income for environmental investigatory and remedial activities were $103.7 million, which include $111.0 million of insurance recoveries for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods. Without these recoveries, charges to income for environmental investigatory and remedial activities in 2019 and 2018 would have been $25.3 million and $7.3 million, respectively. The increase in environmental expense from the prior year primarily relates to a $20.0 million increase in costs at a former manufacturing site resulting from revised remediation estimates as a result of agency action. These charges related primarily to expected future investigatory and remedial activities associated with past manufacturing operations and former waste disposal sites.\nFor 2019, other corporate and unallocated costs were $156.3 million compared to $158.3 million for 2018, a decrease of $2.0 million, or 1%. The decrease was primarily due to lower legal and legal-related settlement expenses of $17.7 million, primarily due to the legal fees associated with the environmental recovery actions in 2018, decreased management incentive expense of $9.4 million, which includes mark-to-market adjustments on stock-based compensation expense, a favorable foreign currency impact of $8.2 million and lower consulting charges of $6.4 million. These decreases were partially offset by higher costs associated with the Information Technology Project of $40.5 million.\nRestructurings\nOn December 11, 2019, we announced that we had made the decision to permanently close a chlor alkali plant with a capacity of 230,000 tons and our VDC production facility, both in Freeport, TX. The VDC facility was closed during the fourth quarter of 2020. The related chlor alkali plant closure is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded pretax restructuring charges of $3.8 million for facility exit costs and employee severance and related benefit costs related to these actions. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded pretax restructuring charges of $58.9 million for facility exit costs and non-cash impairment of equipment and facilities related to these actions.\nOn December 10, 2018, we announced that we had made the decision to permanently close the ammunition assembly operations at our Winchester facility in Geelong, Australia. Subsequent to the facility's closure, products for customers in the region are sourced from Winchester manufacturing facilities located in the United States. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded pretax restructuring charges of $0.4 million and $4.1 million, respectively for the write-off of equipment and facility costs, employee severance and related benefit costs, lease and other contract termination costs and facility exit costs related to this action.\nSubsequent Event\nOn January 18, 2021, we announced we had made the decision to permanently close our trichloroethylene and anhydrous hydrogen chloride liquefaction facilities in Freeport, TX, before the end of 2021. We expect to incur restructuring charges through 2023 of approximately $23 million related to these actions, approximately $2 million of which is expected to be incurred in 2021. These restructuring costs are expected to consist of $21 million of facility exit costs and $2 million of contract termination costs.\n2021 OUTLOOK\nIn 2021, we expect to continue to implement and benefit from Olin's new operating model of optimizing value across our chemicals businesses. Olin drove sequential pricing improvement in the fourth quarter 2020 for chlorine and almost all chlorine derivatives, including epoxy resins. During 2021, we expect to deliver ECU pricing improvement compared to 2020, partially offset by lower volumes as we continue to selectively sell less into poor quality markets and remain disciplined in our approach to both sides of the ECU. In 2021, we expect year over year improvement in both Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls and Epoxy segment results. During 2021, productivity efforts are also expected to result in lower operating costs across our chemical businesses.\nWinchester 2021 segment income is expected to improve from 2020 segment income of $92.3 million due to higher commercial product pricing and increased sales volumes, which includes ammunition produced at Lake City. During 2020, Winchester segment results included transition costs related to the Lake City contract of $13.5 million.\nOther Corporate and Unallocated costs in 2021 are expected to be lower than the $154.3 million in 2020, primarily due to 2020 results including $73.9 million of costs associated with the Information Technology Project. The Information Technology Project was substantially completed during 2020. Partially offsetting these lower costs in 2021 will be higher management incentive expense, including mark-to-market adjustments on stock-based compensation expense.\nDuring 2021, we anticipate environmental expenses in the $20 million to $25 million range compared to $20.9 million in 2020.\nWe expect non-operating pension income in 2021 to be in the $30 million to $35 million range compared to $18.9 million in 2020. Based on our plan assumptions and estimates, we will not be required to make any cash contributions to our domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2021. We have several international qualified defined benefit pension plans for which we anticipate cash contributions of less than $5 million in 2020.\nIn 2021, we currently expect our capital spending to be in the $200 million range, which would be approximately $100 million lower than 2020 levels. We expect 2021 depreciation and amortization expense to be in the $575 million to $600 million range.\nWe currently believe the 2021 effective tax rate will be in the 15% to 20% range, while we expect cash taxes will be in the range of $15 million, which primarily reflects the utilization of domestic tax loss carryforwards.\nPENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS\nUnder ASC 715, we recorded an after-tax benefit of $14.8 million ($26.6 million pretax) to shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2020 for our pension and other postretirement plans. This benefit primarily reflected favorable performance on plan assets during 2020, partially offset by a 80-basis point decrease in the domestic pension plans' discount rate. In 2019, we recorded an after-tax charge of $150.2 million ($183.9 million pretax) to shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2019 for our pension and other postretirement plans. This charge primarily reflected a 100-basis point decrease in the domestic pension plans' discount rate, partially offset by favorable performance on plan assets during 2019. In 2018, we recorded an after-tax charge of $74.9 million ($98.5 million pretax) to shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2018 for our pension and other postretirement plans. This charge primarily reflected unfavorable performance on plan assets during 2018, partially offset by a 60-basis point increase in the domestic pension plans' discount rate. These non-cash charges to shareholders' equity do not affect our ability to borrow under our senior secured credit facility.\nDuring 2019, we made a discretionary cash contribution to our domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan of $12.5 million. Based on our plan assumptions and estimates, we will not be required to make any cash contributions to the domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan at least through 2021.\nIn connection with international qualified defined benefit pension plans, we made cash contributions of $2.1 million, $2.4 million and $2.6 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and we anticipate less than $5 million of cash contributions to international qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2021.\nAt December 31, 2020, the projected benefit obligation of $3,199.4 million exceeded the market value of assets in our qualified defined benefit pension plans by $730.3 million, as calculated under ASC 715.\nComponents of net periodic benefit (income) costs were:\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>($ in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension benefits </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(11.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(8.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(14.5) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other postretirement benefit costs </td> <td>4.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe service cost component of net periodic benefit (income) costs related to employees of the operating segments are allocated to the operating segments based on their respective estimated census data.\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash outlays: </td> <td>($ in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remedial and investigatory spending (charged to reserve) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital spending </td> <td>3.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plant operations (charged to cost of goods sold) </td> <td>182.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>188.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>197.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash outlays </td> <td>$ </td> <td>199.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>201.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>212.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash outlays for remedial and investigatory activities associated with former waste sites and past operations were not charged to income but instead were charged to reserves established for such costs identified and expensed to income in prior years. Cash outlays for normal plant operations for the disposal of waste and the operation and maintenance of pollution control equipment and facilities to ensure compliance with mandated and voluntarily imposed environmental quality standards were charged to income.\nTotal environmental-related cash outlays for 2021 are estimated to be approximately $210 million, of which approximately $19 million is expected to be spent on investigatory and remedial efforts, approximately $3 million on capital projects and approximately $188 million on normal plant operations. Remedial and investigatory spending is anticipated to be higher in 2021 than 2020 due to the timing of continuing remedial action plans and investigations. Historically, we have funded our environmental capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and expect to do so in the future.\nAnnual environmental-related cash outlays for site investigation and remediation, capital projects and normal plant operations are expected to range between $200 million to $220 million over the next several years, $15 million to $25 million of which is for investigatory and remedial efforts, which are expected to be charged against reserves recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. While we do not anticipate a material increase in the projected annual level of our environmental-related cash outlays for site investigation and remediation, there is always the possibility that such an increase may occur in the future in view of the uncertainties associated with environmental exposures.\nOur liabilities for future environmental expenditures were as follows:\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>($ in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beginning balance </td> <td>$ </td> <td>139.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>125.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>131.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Charges to income </td> <td>20.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remedial and investigatory spending </td> <td>(12.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.0) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency translation adjustments </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.3) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ending balance </td> <td>$ </td> <td>147.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>139.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>125.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs is common in our industry, we are subject to environmental laws and regulations related to the use, storage, handling, generation, transportation, emission, discharge, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes in all of the countries in which we do business.\nThe establishment and implementation of national, state or provincial and local standards to regulate air, water and land quality affect substantially all of our manufacturing locations around the world. Laws providing for regulation of the manufacture, transportation, use and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances, and remediation of contaminated sites, have imposed additional regulatory requirements on industry, particularly the chemicals industry. In addition, implementation of environmental laws has required and will continue to require new capital expenditures and will increase plant operating costs. We employ waste minimization and pollution prevention programs at our manufacturing sites.\nWe are party to various government and private environmental actions associated with past manufacturing facilities and former waste disposal sites. Associated costs of investigatory and remedial activities are provided for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles governing probability and the ability to reasonably estimate future costs. Our ability to estimate future costs depends on whether our investigatory and remedial activities are in preliminary or advanced stages. With respect to unasserted claims, we accrue liabilities for costs that, in our experience, we expect to incur to protect our interests against those unasserted claims. Our accrued liabilities for unasserted claims amounted to $9.0 million at December 31, 2020. With respect to asserted claims, we accrue liabilities based on remedial investigation, feasibility study, remedial action and operation, maintenance and monitoring (OM&M) expenses that, in our experience, we expect to incur in connection with the asserted claims. Required site OM&M expenses are estimated and accrued in their entirety for required periods not exceeding 30 years, which reasonably approximates the typical duration of long-term site OM&M.\nEnvironmental provisions charged (credited) to income, which are included in cost of goods sold, were as follows:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>($ in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provisions charged to income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance recoveries for costs incurred and expensed </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(111.0) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental expense (income) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(103.7) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese charges relate primarily to remedial and investigatory activities associated with past manufacturing operations and former waste disposal sites and may be material to operating results in future years.\nDuring 2018, we settled certain disputes with respect to insurance coverage for costs at various environmental remediation sites for $121.0 million. Environmental expense (income) for the year ended December 31, 2018 include insurance recoveries for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods of $111.0 million. The recoveries are reduced by estimated liabilities of $10.0 million associated with claims by subsequent owners of certain of the settled environmental sites. Environmental expense (income) for the year ended December 31, 2019 included $4.8 million of recoveries associated with resolving the outstanding third party claims against the proceeds from the 2018 environmental insurance settlement.\nOur total estimated environmental liability at December 31, 2020 was attributable to 58 sites, 14 of which were United States Environmental Protection Agency National Priority List sites. Nine sites accounted for 82% of our environmental liability and, of the remaining 49 sites, no one site accounted for more than 3% of our environmental liability. At seven of the nine sites, part of the site is in the long-term OM&M stage. At six of the nine sites, we are implementing a remedial action plan for part of the site. At five of the nine sites, a remedial design is being developed at part of the site and at four of the nine sites, part of the site is subject to a remedial investigation. All nine sites are either associated with past manufacturing operations or former waste disposal sites. None of the nine largest sites represents more than 23% of the liabilities reserved on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2020 for future environmental expenditures.\nOur consolidated balance sheets included liabilities for future environmental expenditures to investigate and remediate known sites amounting to $147.2 million at December 31, 2020, and $139.0 million at December 31, 2019, of which $128.2 million and $122.0 million, respectively, were classified as other noncurrent liabilities. Our environmental liability amounts do not take into account any discounting of future expenditures or any consideration of insurance recoveries or advances in technology. These liabilities are reassessed periodically to determine if environmental circumstances have changed and/or remediation efforts and our estimate of related costs have changed. As a result of these reassessments, future charges to income may be made for additional liabilities. Of the $147.2 million included on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2020 for future environmental expenditures, we currently expect to utilize $88.5 million of the reserve for future environmental expenditures over the next 5 years, $27.6 million for expenditures 6 to 10 years in the future, and $31.1 million for expenditures beyond 10 years in the future. These estimates are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, as described in Environmental Costs\u201d contained in Item 1A - Risk Factors.\u201d\nEnvironmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons, including the identification of new sites, developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies, advances in technology, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application, changes in regulatory authorities, the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites, the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other PRPs, our ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the lengthy time periods over which site remediation occurs. It is possible that some of these matters (the outcomes of which are subject to various uncertainties) may be resolved unfavorably to us, which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations. At December 31, 2020, we estimate it is reasonably possible that we may have\nadditional contingent environmental liabilities of $60 million in addition to the amounts for which we have already recorded as a reserve.\nLEGAL MATTERS AND CONTINGENCIES\nPlease see the discussion of legal matters and contingencies within Item 8, under the heading of Legal Matters\u201d within Note 23, Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d\nLIQUIDITY, INVESTMENT ACTIVITY AND OTHER FINANCIAL DATA\nCash Flow Data\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provided by (used for) </td> <td>($ in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>418.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>617.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>907.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures </td> <td>(298.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(385.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(385.2) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payments under long-term supply contracts </td> <td>(536.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from disposition of non-consolidated affiliate </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investing activities </td> <td>(835.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(365.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(382.3) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt borrowings (repayments), net </td> <td>520.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(376.1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common stock repurchased and retired </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(145.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(50.0) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt issuance costs </td> <td>(10.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.5) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net financing activities </td> <td>385.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(209.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(564.8) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nFor 2020, cash provided by operating activities decreased by $198.9 million from 2019, primarily due to a decrease in operating results, partially offset by a decrease in the investment in working capital from the prior year. During 2020, we executed a strategy to improve our working capital and manage our balance sheet to maximize our financial flexibility. For 2020, working capital decreased $141.6 million, which included an approximately $67 million investment in working capital to support Lake City operations, compared to a decrease of $11.0 million in 2019. In 2020, inventories decreased by $28.6 million, primarily as a result of lower raw material costs and lower Winchester inventory due to improved commercial ammunition demand, partially offset by the investment in Lake City inventory. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by $149.3 million as a result of specific actions taken by management to improve Olin's working capital.\nFor 2019, cash provided by operating activities decreased by $290.5 million from 2018, primarily due to a decrease in operating results partially offset by a decrease in the investment in working capital from the prior year. For 2019, working capital decreased $11.0 million compared to an increase of $71.6 million in 2018. Receivables decreased from December 31, 2018 by $12.3 million primarily as a result of lower sales in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 partially offset by a decrease in receivables sold under the accounts receivable factoring arrangement. In 2019, inventories decreased by $13.0 million and accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased by $11.0 million. The decreases in inventories and accounts payable were primarily due to lower raw material costs.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital spending was $298.9 million and $385.6 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Capital spending was 67% and 78% of depreciation in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nIn 2017, we began a multi-year implementation of the Information Technology Project. The project standardized business processes across the chemicals businesses with the objective of maximizing cost effectiveness, efficiency and control across our global operations. The project was completed in 2020. Our results for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 include $41.0 million, $56.0 million and $84.5 million, respectively, of capital spending and $73.9 million, $77.0 million and $36.5 million, respectively, of expenses associated with this project.\nIn 2021, we expect our capital spending to be in the $200 million range.\nInvesting Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, a payment of $461.0 million was made associated with long-term supply contracts to reserve additional ethylene at producer economics from Dow and a payment of $75.8 million was made associated with the resolution of a dispute over the allocation to Olin of certain capital costs incurred at our Plaquemine, LA site after the October 5, 2015 closing date of the acquisition of Dow's Chlorine Products business (the Acquisition).\nOn January 1, 2019, we sold our 9.1% limited partnership interest in Bay Gas for $20.0 million. The sale closed on February 7, 2019 which resulted in a gain of $11.2 million.\nFinancing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, our long-term debt borrowings, net of long-term debt repayments, were $520.3 million, which primarily included borrowings of $500.0 million from the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility, $497.5 million from the issuance of the 2025 Notes and $125.0 million under our Receivables Financing Agreement, partially offset by repayments for the redemption of $600.0 million of the 2023 Notes.\nOn October 15, 2020, Olin redeemed $600.0 million of the outstanding 9.75% senior notes due 2023. The 2023 Notes were redeemed at 102.438% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes, resulting in a redemption premium of $14.6 million. The 2023 Notes were redeemed by drawing $500.0 million of the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility along with utilizing $114.6 million of cash on hand.\nOn May 19, 2020, Olin issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.50% senior notes due June 1, 2025. The 2025 Notes were issued at 99.5% of par value, the discount from which is included within long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheet. Interest on the 2025 Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on December 1, 2020. Proceeds from the 2025 Notes were used for general corporate purposes.\nOn May 8, 2020, we entered into a $1,300.0 million senior secured credit facility (Senior Secured Credit Facility) that amended our existing five-year, $2,000.0 million senior credit facility. The Senior Secured Credit Facility included a $500.0 million senior secured delayed-draw term loan facility (Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility) and a $800.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (Senior Revolving Credit Facility). The maturity date for the Senior Secured Credit Facility is July 16, 2024. The amendment modified the financial covenants of the Senior Secured Credit Facility to be less restrictive and expanded the permitted use of proceeds of the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility to include general corporate purposes.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our long-term debt borrowings, net of long-term debt repayments, were $80.8 million, which included repayments of $543.0 million related to the $1,375.0 million Term Loan Facility and $150.0 million related to the Receivables Financing Agreement.\nOn July 16, 2019, Olin issued $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior notes due August 1, 2029 (2029 Notes), which were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Proceeds from the 2029 Notes were used to redeem the remaining balance of the $1,375.0 million Term Loan Facility of $493.0 million and $150.0 million of the Receivables Financing Agreement.\nOn July 16, 2019, Olin entered into a five-year, $2,000.0 million senior credit facility (2019 Senior Credit Facility), which replaced the existing $1,975.0 million senior credit facility (2017 Senior Credit Facility). In December 2019, Olin amended the 2019 Senior Credit Facility which amended the restrictive covenants of the agreement, including expanding the coverage and leverage ratios to be less restrictive over the next two and a half years. The 2019 Senior Credit Facility included a senior unsecured delayed-draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1,200.0 million and an $800.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility.\nIn 2020, no shares were repurchased. In 2019, we repurchased and retired 8.0 million shares with a total value of $145.9 million.\nIn 2020, we paid debt issuance costs of $10.3 million, primarily for the issuance of the 2025 Notes and amendments to our Senior Secured Credit Facility and Receivables Financing Agreement. In 2019, we paid debt issuance costs of $16.6 million, primarily for the issuance of the 2029 Notes and the 2019 Senior Credit Facility.\nThe percent of total debt to total capitalization increased to 72.7% at December 31, 2020 compared to 58.0% at\nDecember 31, 2019, as a result of a higher level of debt outstanding and lower shareholders' equity primarily resulting from the goodwill impairment charge.\nDividends per common share were $0.80 in 2020 and 2019. Total dividends paid on common stock amounted to $126.3 million and $129.3 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. On February 15, 2021, our board of directors declared a dividend of $0.20 per share on our common stock, payable on March 10, 2021 to shareholders of record on March 2, 2021.\nThe payment of cash dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be determined in light of then-current conditions, including our earnings, our operations, our financial condition, our capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. In the future, our board of directors may change our dividend policy, including the frequency or amount of any dividend, in light of then-existing conditions.\nLIQUIDITY AND OTHER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS\nOur principal sources of liquidity are from cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations and borrowings under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility, Receivables Financing Agreement and AR Facilities. Additionally, we believe that we have access to the debt and equity markets.\nThe overall cash decrease of $31.2 million in 2020 primarily reflects our payments under long-term supply contracts, capital spending and dividends paid, partially offset by borrowings under the 2025 Notes and a decrease in working capital. We believe, based on current and projected levels of cash flow from our operations, together with our cash and cash equivalents on hand and the availability to borrow under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility, Receivables Financing Agreement and AR Facilities, we have sufficient liquidity to meet our short-term and long-term needs to make required payments of interest on our debt, fund our operating needs, working capital, and capital expenditure requirements and comply with the financial ratios in our debt agreements.\nOn April 26, 2018, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for the purchase of shares of common stock at an aggregate price of up to $500.0 million. This program will terminate upon the purchase of $500.0 million of our common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2020, there were no shares repurchased. For the year ended December 31, 2019, 8.0 million shares were repurchased and retired at a cost of $145.9 million. As of December 31, 2020, a total of 10.1 million shares were repurchased and retired at a cost of $195.9 million and $304.1 million of common stock remained authorized to be repurchased.\nOn October 15, 2020, Olin redeemed $600.0 million of the outstanding 2023 Notes. The 2023 Notes were redeemed at 102.438% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes, resulting in a redemption premium of $14.6 million. The 2023 Notes were redeemed by drawing $500.0 million of the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility along with utilizing $114.6 million of cash on hand. On January 15, 2021, Olin redeemed the remaining $120.0 million of the outstanding 2023 Notes. The 2023 Notes were redeemed at 102.438% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes, resulting in a redemption premium of $2.9 million. The remaining 2023 Notes were redeemed by utilizing $122.9 million of cash on hand.\nOn May 19, 2020, Olin issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.50% senior notes due June 1, 2025. The 2025 Notes were issued at 99.5% of par value, the discount from which is included within long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheet. Interest on the 2025 Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on December 1, 2020. Proceeds from the 2025 Notes were used for general corporate purposes.\nOn May 8, 2020, we entered into a $1,300.0 million Senior Secured Credit Facility that amended the existing 2019 Senior Credit Facility. The Senior Secured Credit Facility included a Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility with aggregate commitments of $500.0 million and a Senior Revolving Credit Facility with aggregate commitments in an amount equal to $800.0 million. The maturity date for the Senior Secured Credit Facility is July 16, 2024. The amendment modified the financial covenants of the Senior Secured Credit Facility to be less restrictive and expanded the permitted use of proceeds of the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility to include general corporate purposes.\nThe amendment also requires that the obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facility be guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries, which are also guarantors of Olin's outstanding notes, with the exception of the $200.0 million senior notes due 2022. The obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facility are also secured by liens on substantially all of Olin's and the subsidiary guarantors' personal property (Collateral), other than certain principal properties and capital stock of subsidiaries, and subject to certain other exceptions. The amendment provides that substantially all guarantees under the Senior Secured Credit Facility and liens on the Collateral may be released when our net leverage ratio is below 3.50 to 1.00 for two consecutive fiscal quarters.\nOn October 15, 2020, Olin drew the entire $500.0 million of the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility. The Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility includes principal amortization amounts payable beginning the quarter ending after the facility is fully drawn at a rate of 5.0% per annum for the first two years, increasing to 7.5% per annum for the following year and to 10.0% per annum for the last two years. The Senior Revolving Credit Facility includes a $100.0 million letter of credit subfacility. At December 31, 2020, we had $799.6 million available under our $800.0 million Senior Revolving Credit Facility because we had issued $0.4 million of letters of credit.\nUnder the Senior Secured Credit Facility, we may select various floating-rate borrowing options. The actual interest rate paid on borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facility is based on a pricing grid which is dependent upon the net leverage ratio as calculated under the terms of the applicable facility for the prior fiscal quarter. The Senior Secured Credit Facility includes various customary restrictive covenants, including restrictions related to the ratio of secured debt to earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization (secured leverage ratio) and the ratio of earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization to interest expense (coverage ratio). The calculation of secured debt in our secured leverage ratio excludes borrowings under the Receivables Financing Agreement, up to a maximum of $250.0 million. As of December 31, 2020, the only secured borrowings included in the secured leverage ratio were $500.0 million for our Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility and $153.0 million for our Go Zone and Recovery Zone bonds. Compliance with these covenants is determined quarterly. We were in compliance with all covenants and restrictions under all our outstanding credit agreements as of December 31, 2020, and no event of default had occurred that would permit the lenders under our outstanding credit agreements to accelerate the debt if not cured. In the future, our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flows, among other factors, will determine the amounts available to be borrowed under these facilities. As a result of our restrictive covenant related to the secured leverage ratio, the maximum additional borrowings available to us could be limited in the future. The limitation, if an amendment or waiver from our lenders is not obtained, could restrict our ability to borrow the maximum amounts available under the Senior Revolving Credit Facility and the Receivables Financing Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, there were no covenants or other restrictions that limited our ability to borrow.\nOn July 16, 2019, Olin issued $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior notes due August 1, 2029, which were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Proceeds from the 2029 Notes were used to redeem the remaining balance of the $1,375.0 million term loan facility of $493.0 million and $150.0 million of the Receivables Financing Agreement.\nOn July 16, 2019, Olin also entered into a five-year, $2,000.0 million senior credit facility, which replaced the existing 2017 Senior Credit Facility. In December 2019, Olin amended the 2019 Senior Credit Facility which amended the restrictive covenants of the agreement, including expanding the coverage and leverage ratios to be less restrictive over the next two and a half years. The 2019 Senior Credit Facility included a senior unsecured delayed-draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1,200.0 million and an $800.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility.\nIn connection with the Acquisition, Olin and Dow entered into arrangements for the long-term supply of ethylene by Dow to Olin, pursuant to which, among other things, Olin made upfront payments in order to receive ethylene at producer economics and for certain reservation fees and for the option to obtain additional future ethylene supply at producer economics. On February 27, 2017, we exercised the remaining option to obtain additional ethylene at producer economics from Dow. In connection with the exercise of this option, we also secured a long-term customer arrangement. As a result, during 2020 an additional payment was made to Dow for $461.0 million.\nOn July 16, 2019, our existing $250.0 million Receivables Financing Agreement was extended to July 15, 2022 and downsized to $10.0 million with the option to expand (Receivables Financing Agreement). In 2020, we amended the Receivables Financing Agreement to expand the borrowing capacity to $250.0 million. The Receivables Financing Agreement includes a minimum borrowing requirement of 50% of the facility limit or available borrowing capacity, whichever is lesser. The administrative agent for our Receivables Financing Agreement is PNC Bank, National Association. Under the Receivables Financing Agreement, our eligible trade receivables are used for collateralized borrowings and continue to be serviced by us. In addition, the Receivables Financing Agreement incorporates the secured leverage covenant that is contained in the Senior Secured Credit Facility. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the outstanding balance of the $250.0 million Receivables Financing Agreement of $150.0 million was repaid with proceeds from the issuance of 2029 Notes. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $125.0 million and zero, respectively, drawn under the agreement. As of December 31, 2020, $332.8 million of our trade receivables were pledged as collateral. As of December 31, 2020, we had $124.0 million of additional borrowing capacity under the Receivables Financing Agreement.\nOlin also has trade accounts receivable factoring arrangements (AR Facilities) and pursuant to the terms of the AR Facilities, certain of our subsidiaries may sell their accounts receivable up to a maximum of $228.0 million. We will continue\nto service the outstanding accounts sold. These receivables qualify for sales treatment under ASC 860 Transfers and Servicing\u201d and, accordingly, the proceeds are included in net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The gross amount of receivables sold for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 totaled $854.3 million and $984.8 million, respectively. The factoring discount paid under the AR Facilities is recorded as interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations. The factoring discount for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $1.5 million and $2.9 million, respectively. The agreements are without recourse and therefore no recourse liability has been recorded as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, $48.8 million and $63.1 million, respectively, of receivables qualifying for sales treatment were outstanding and will continue to be serviced by us.\nFor 2020, cash provided by operating activities decreased by $198.9 million from 2019, primarily due to a decrease in operating results, partially offset by a decrease in the investment in working capital from the prior year. During 2020, we executed a strategy to improve our working capital and manage our balance sheet to maximize our financial flexibility. For 2020, working capital decreased $141.6 million, which included an approximately $67 million investment in working capital to support Lake City operations, compared to a decrease of $11.0 million in 2019. In 2020, inventories decreased by $28.6 million, primarily as a result of lower raw material costs and lower Winchester inventory due to improved commercial ammunition demand, partially offset by the investment in Lake City inventory. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by $149.3 million as a result of specific actions taken by management to improve Olin's working capital.\nCapital spending was $298.9 million and $385.6 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Capital spending was 67% and 78% of depreciation in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nIn 2017, we began a multi-year implementation of the Information Technology Project. The project standardized business processes across the chemicals businesses with the objective of maximizing cost effectiveness, efficiency and control across our global operations. The project was completed during 2020. Our results for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 include $41.0 million, $56.0 million and $84.5 million, respectively, of capital spending and $73.9 million, $77.0 million and $36.5 million, respectively, of expenses associated with this project.\nIn 2021, we expect our capital spending to be in the $200 million range, which is expected to be an additional $100 million lower than 2020 levels.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had total letters of credit of $80.4 million outstanding, of which $0.4 million were issued under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility. The letters of credit were used to support certain long-term debt, certain workers compensation insurance policies, certain plant closure and post-closure obligations, certain international payment obligations and certain international pension funding requirements.\nOur current debt structure is used to fund our business operations. As of December 31, 2020, we had long-term borrowings, including the current installment and finance lease obligations, of $3,863.8 million, of which $780.9 million was at variable rates. Annual maturities of long-term debt, including finance lease obligations, are $26.3 million in 2021, $351.1 million in 2022, $158.4 million in 2023, $483.3 million in 2024, $1,003.1 million in 2025 and a total of $1,883.0 million thereafter. Commitments from banks under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility, Receivables Financing Agreement and AR Facilities are an additional source of liquidity. Included within the $3,863.8 million of long-term borrowings on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 were unamortized deferred debt issuance costs, unamortized bond original issue discount and deferred losses on fair value interest rate swaps of $41.4 million.\nWe have registered an undetermined amount of securities with the SEC, so that, from time-to-time, we may issue debt securities, preferred stock and/or common stock and associated warrants in the public market under that registration statement.\nSupplemental Guarantor Financial Information\nOlin Corporation (the Parent Issuer) issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.50% senior notes due 2025, $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due 2027, $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior notes due 2029 and $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior notes due 2030 (collectively, the Senior Notes) which are wholly and unconditionally guaranteed by Sunbelt Chlor Alkali Partnership, Olin Chlorine 7, LLC, Blue Cube Operations, LLC, Pioneer America LLC, Olin Winchester, LLC and Winchester Ammunition, Inc. (collectively, the Subsidiary Guarantors) and Blue Cube Spinco LLC (the Subsidiary Issuer). The Subsidiary Guarantors and Subsidiary Issuer are fully consolidated subsidiaries of the Parent Issuer. The Subsidiary Issuer issued $720.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.75% senior notes due 2023 and $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 10.00% senior notes due 2025 (collectively, the Blue Cube Notes), which are wholly and unconditionally guaranteed by Olin Corporation (the Parent Guarantor) along with\nthe Subsidiary Guarantors. All guarantees are joint and several. This financial information is being presented in relation to the guarantees of the payment of principal, interest and premium (if any) on the Senior Notes and Blue Cube Notes.\nThe guarantees are subject to release upon the occurrence of certain customary release covenants, including, but not limited to, (i) the sale or other disposition, including the sale of substantially all of the assets or the capital stock, of the applicable subsidiary guarantor, (ii) the release, discharge or other termination of the debt (or the guarantee thereof) which triggered the applicable guarantee requirement, (iii) the legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or discharge of the applicable indenture or (iv) the subsidiary guarantor no longer being a restricted subsidiary under the applicable indenture. There are no significant organizational structure factors, limitations on enforceability of the guarantees, additional restrictions imposed on dividends or other significant factors that would affect payments to the holders of the Senior Notes or Blue Cube Notes.\nThe following tables present summarized financial information of the Parent Guarantor, Subsidiary Guarantors, Parent Issuer and Subsidiary Issuer on a combined basis after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances among the guarantors and issuers and (ii) equity (loss) in earnings from and investments in any

unamortized bond original issue discount and deferred losses on fair value interest rate swaps of $41.4 million at December 31, 2020. All debt obligations are assumed to be held until maturity.\n(2)For the purposes of this table, we have assumed for all periods presented that there are no changes in the rates from those in effect at December 31, 2020 which ranged from 0.21% to 10.00%.\n(3)Given the inherent uncertainty as to actual minimum funding requirements for qualified defined benefit pension plans, no amounts are included in this table for any period beyond one year. Based on the current funding requirements, we will not be required to make any cash contributions to the domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan at least through 2021.\n(4)These amounts are only estimated payments assuming for our foreign qualified pension plans a weighted average annual expected rate of return on pension plan assets of 4.4% and a discount rate on pension plan obligations of 0.8%. These estimated payments are subject to significant variation and the actual payments may be more than the amounts estimated. In connection with international qualified defined benefit pension plans we made cash contributions of $2.1 million, $2.4 million and $2.6 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and we anticipate less than $5 million of cash contributions to international qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2021.\nNon-cancelable operating leases and purchasing commitments are utilized in our normal course of business for our projected needs. Our operating lease commitments are primarily for railroad cars, but also include logistics, manufacturing, office and storage facilities and equipment, information technology equipment and land. Virtually none of our lease agreements contain escalation clauses or step rent provisions. We have supply contracts with various third parties for certain raw materials, including ethylene, electricity, propylene and benzene. These contracts have initial terms ranging from several to 20 years. For losses that we believe are probable and which are estimable, we have accrued for such amounts in our consolidated balance sheets. In addition to the table above, we have various commitments and contingencies including: defined benefit and postretirement healthcare plans (as described below), environmental matters (see discussion under Environmental Matters\u201d) and litigation claims (see discussion under Item 8, under the heading of Legal Matters\u201d within Note 23, Commitments and Contingencies\u201d).\nWe have several defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans, as described in Note 13 Pension Plans\u201d and Note 17 Contributing Employee Ownership Plan\u201d in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. We fund the defined benefit pension plans based on the minimum amounts required by law plus such amounts we deem\nappropriate. We have postretirement healthcare plans that provide health and life insurance benefits to certain retired employees and their beneficiaries, as described in Note 14 Postretirement Benefits\u201d in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. The defined contribution and other postretirement plans are not pre-funded and expenses are paid by us as incurred.\nWe also have standby letters of credit of $80.4 million of which $0.4 million have been issued through our Senior Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2020, we had $799.6 million available under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility because we had issued $0.4 million of letters of credit.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Significant estimates in our consolidated financial statements include goodwill recoverability, environmental, restructuring and other unusual items, litigation, income tax reserves including deferred tax asset valuation allowances, pension, postretirement and other benefits and allowance for doubtful accounts. We base our estimates on prior experience, current facts and circumstances and other assumptions. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and/or when circumstances or other events indicate that impairment may have occurred. ASC 350 Intangibles-Goodwill and Other\u201d (ASC 350) permits entities to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the goodwill impairment test. Circumstances that are considered as part of the qualitative assessment and could trigger a quantitative impairment test include, but are not limited to: a significant adverse change in the business climate; a significant adverse legal judgment; adverse cash flow trends; an adverse action or assessment by a government agency; unanticipated competition; sustained decline in our stock price; and a significant restructuring charge within a reporting unit. We define reporting units at the business segment level or one level below the business segment level. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to our reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit.\nIt is our practice, at a minimum, to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter every three years. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we performed our triennial quantitative goodwill impairment test for our reporting units. We use a discounted cash flow approach to develop the estimated fair value of a reporting unit when a quantitative review is performed. Management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model. We also corroborate our discounted cash flow analysis by evaluating a market-based approach that considers earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) multiples from a representative sample of comparable public companies. As a further indicator that each reporting unit has been valued appropriately using a discounted cash flow model, the aggregate fair value of all reporting units is reconciled to the total market value of Olin. An impairment would be recorded if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the estimated fair value. Based on the aforementioned analysis, the estimated fair value of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value of the reporting units.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, our market capitalization declined significantly compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Over the same period, the equity value of our peer group companies and the overall U.S. stock market also declined significantly amid market volatility. These declines were driven by the uncertainty surrounding the outbreak of the COVID-19 global pandemic and other macroeconomic events impacting the various industries in which Olin and our peers participate. Additionally, the various governmental, business and consumer responses to the pandemic were expected to have a negative impact on the near-term demand for several of the products produced by our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls and Epoxy businesses. The full extent and duration of the impact of COVID-19 on our operations and financial performance was unknown at the time. As a result of these events, we identified triggering events associated with a significant overall decrease in our stock price, a significant adverse change in the business climate and a significant reduction in near-term cash flow projections and performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test during the first quarter of 2020. We used a discounted cash flow approach to develop the estimated fair value of our reporting units. Based on the aforementioned analysis, the estimated fair value of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value of the reporting units and no impairment charges were recorded.\nThroughout the second and third quarters of 2020, the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated response has caused significant disruptions in the U.S. and global economies, resulting in the disruption of the supply and demand fundamentals of our Chemicals businesses. The various governmental, business and consumer responses to the pandemic continued to negatively impact the demand for several of the products produced by our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls and Epoxy businesses resulting in lower volumes and pricing during 2020 compared to 2019. Due to these factors, the triggering events identified in the first quarter associated with a significant adverse change in the business climate and a significant adverse reduction in near-term cash flow projections have persisted during 2020. Throughout the second and third quarters of 2020, the equity value of our peer group companies and the overall U.S. stock market improved significantly while Olin's stock price remained low. During the three months ended September 30, 2020, we identified a triggering event associated with a sustained significant overall decrease in our stock price. As a result, we performed an updated quantitative goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of 2020. We used a discounted cash flow approach to develop the estimated fair value of our reporting units.\nFair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates and market factors. The discount rate, profitability assumptions and terminal growth rate of our reporting units and the supply and demand fundamentals of the chlor alkali industry were the material assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow model used to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit. The discount rate reflects a weighted-average cost of capital, which is calculated, in part based on observable market data. Some of this data (such as the risk free or treasury rate and the pretax cost of debt) are based on the market data at a point in time. Other data (such as the equity risk premium) are based upon market data over time for a peer group of companies in the chemical manufacturing or distribution industries with a market capitalization premium added, as applicable. Also factoring into the discount rate was a market participant's perceived risk (such as the company specific risk premium) in the valuation implied by the sustained reduction in our stock price.\nThe discounted cash flow analysis requires estimates, assumptions and judgments about future events. Our analysis uses our internally generated long-range plan. Specifically, the assumptions in our long-range plan about terminal growth rates, forecasted capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements are used to determine the implied fair value of each reporting unit. The long-range plan reflects management judgment, supplemented by independent chemical industry analyses which provide multi-year chlor alkali industry operating and pricing forecasts.\nAs a further indicator that each reporting unit has been valued appropriately using a discounted cash flow model, the aggregate fair value of all reporting units is reconciled to the total market value of Olin. Due to the sustained decline in our stock price, the decrease in the value of our reporting units reflects a market participant's perceived risk in the valuation implied by the sustained reduction in our stock price. As a result of this assessment, the carrying values of our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls and Epoxy reporting units exceeded the fair values which resulted in pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $557.6 million and $142.2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020. The goodwill impairment charge was calculated as the amount that the carrying value of the reporting unit, including any goodwill, exceeded its fair value and therefore the carrying value of our reporting units equal their fair value upon completion of the goodwill impairment test.\nWe believe the assumptions used in our goodwill impairment analysis are appropriate and result in reasonable estimates of the implied fair value of each reporting unit. However, given the economic environment and the uncertainties regarding the impact on our business, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions, made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing, will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. If our assumptions regarding future performance are not achieved, or if our stock price experiences further sustained declines, we may be required to record additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods. It is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or, if it does, whether such charge would be material.\nNo impairment charges were recorded for 2019 or 2018.\nEnvironmental\nAccruals (charges to income) for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, based upon current law and existing technologies. These amounts, which are not discounted and are exclusive of claims against third parties, are adjusted periodically as assessments and remediation efforts progress or additional technical or legal information becomes available. Environmental costs are capitalized if the costs increase the value of the property and/or mitigate or prevent contamination from future operations. Environmental costs and recoveries are included in costs of goods sold.\nEnvironmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons, including the identification of new sites, developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies, advances in technology, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application, changes in regulatory authorities, the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites, the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other PRPs and our ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the lengthy time periods over which site remediation occurs. It is possible that some of these matters (the outcomes of which are subject to various uncertainties) may be resolved unfavorably to us, which could materially adversely affect our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nDiscussion of new accounting pronouncements can be referred to under Item 8, within Note 3, Recent Accounting Pronouncements.\u201d\nDERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nWe are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to our purchases of certain commodities, our ongoing investing and financing activities and our operations that use foreign currencies. The risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows and future earnings. We have established policies and procedures governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage exposure to such risks. ASC 815 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and measure those instruments at fair value. In accordance with ASC 815, we designate derivative contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted purchases of commodities and forecasted interest payments related to variable-rate borrowings and designate certain interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of fixed-rate borrowings. We do not enter into any derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nEnergy costs, including electricity and natural gas, and certain raw materials used in our production processes are subject to price volatility. Depending on market conditions, we may enter into futures contracts, forward contracts, commodity swaps and put and call option contracts in order to reduce the impact of commodity price fluctuations. The majority of our commodity derivatives expire within one year.\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.\nWe use cash flow hedges for certain raw material and energy costs such as copper, zinc, lead, ethane, electricity and natural gas to provide a measure of stability in managing our exposure to price fluctuations associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials and energy used in our manufacturing process. Settlements on commodity derivative contracts resulted in (losses) gains of $(14.9) million, $(31.1) million, and $5.4 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively which were included in cost of goods sold. At December 31, 2020, we had open derivative notional contract positions through 2027 totaling $214.1 million (2019-$174.6 million). If all open futures contracts had been settled on December 31, 2020, we would have recognized a pretax gain of $28.4 million.\nIf commodity prices were to remain at December 31, 2020 levels, approximately $16.6 million of deferred gains, net of tax, would be reclassified into earnings during the next twelve months. The actual effect on earnings will be dependent on actual commodity prices when the forecasted transactions occur.\nWe use interest rate swaps as a means of minimizing cash flow fluctuations that may arise from volatility in interest rates of our variable-rate borrowings. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, $4.3 million and $8.9 million, respectively, of income was recorded to interest expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to these swap agreements.\nWe also use interest rate swaps as a means of managing interest expense and floating interest rate exposure to optimal levels. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings. We include the gain or loss on the hedged items (fixed-rate borrowings) in the same line item, interest expense, as the offsetting loss or gain on the related interest rate swaps.\nIn August 2019, we terminated the interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges which resulted in a loss of $2.3 million that will be deferred as an offset to the carrying value of the related debt and will be recognized to interest expense through October 2025. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, $0.4 million, $2.6 million and $2.1 million,\nrespectively, of expense was recorded to interest expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to these swap agreements.\nWe actively manage currency exposures that are associated with net monetary asset positions, currency purchases and sales commitments denominated in foreign currencies and foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. We enter into forward sales and purchase contracts to manage currency risk to offset our net exposures, by currency, related to the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of our operations. At December 31, 2020, we had outstanding forward contracts to buy foreign currency with a notional value of $169.9 million and to sell foreign currency with a notional value of $113.6 million. All of the currency derivatives expire within one year and are for U.S. dollar (USD) equivalents. The counterparties to the forward contracts are large financial institutions; however, the risk of loss to us in the event of nonperformance by a counterparty could impact our financial position or results of operations.

For 2020, working capital decreased $141.6 million, which included an approximately $67 million investment in working capital to support Lake City operations, compared to a decrease of $11.0 million in 2019. In 2020, inventories decreased by $28.6 million, primarily as a result of lower raw material costs and lower Winchester inventory due to improved commercial ammunition demand, partially offset by the investment in Lake City inventory. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by $149.3 million as a result of specific actions taken by management to improve Olin's working capital.\nThe establishment and implementation of national, state or provincial and local standards to regulate air, water and land quality affect substantially all of our manufacturing locations around the world.

In addition, implementation of environmental laws has required and will continue to require new capital expenditures and will increase plant operating costs.

postretirement plans. This benefit primarily reflected favorable performance on plan assets during 2020, partially offset by a 80-basis point decrease in the domestic pension plans' discount rate. In 2019, we recorded an after-tax charge of $150.2 million ($183.9 million pretax) to shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2019 for our pension and other postretirement plans. This charge primarily reflected a 100-basis point decrease in the domestic pension plans' discount rate, partially offset by favorable performance on plan assets during 2019. In 2018, we recorded an after-tax charge of $74.9 million ($98.5 million pretax) to shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2018 for our pension and other postretirement plans. This charge primarily reflected unfavorable performance on plan assets during 2018, partially offset by a 60-basis point increase in the domestic pension plans' discount rate. These non-cash charges to shareholders' equity do not affect our ability to borrow under our senior secured credit facility.\n(6)Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 included $14.6 million of expense related to the 2023 Notes redemption premium and $5.8 million for the write-off of deferred debt issuance costs associated with financing transactions during 2020. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 included $4.0 million, $17.0 million and $16.0 million, respectively, of accretion expense related to the ethylene payment discount. Interest expense was reduced by capitalized interest of $6.4 million, $10.8 million and $6.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nGross margin decreased $453.2 million, or 40%, from 2018. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls gross margin decreased by $342.1 million, primarily due to lower caustic soda pricing, partially offset by lower raw material and operating costs. Epoxy gross margin decreased $20.6 million primarily due to lower product prices, partially offset by lower raw material costs, primarily benzene and propylene, and lower maintenance and unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs associated with maintenance turnarounds. Winchester gross margin increased $1.2 million primarily due to lower costs, partially offset by lower product prices. Gross margin in 2018 was positively impacted by insurance recoveries for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods of $111.0 million. Gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased to 11% in 2019 from 16% in 2018.\nEpoxy sales were $2,024.4 million for 2019 compared to $2,303.1 million for 2018, a decrease of $278.7 million, or 12%. The sales decrease was primarily due to lower product prices ($258.9 million) and an unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation ($62.5 million), partially offset by increased volumes ($42.7 million).\nWinchester also has a commodity element to its business, but a majority of Winchester ammunition is sold as a branded consumer product where there are opportunities to differentiate certain offerings through innovative new product development and enhanced product performance. While competitive pricing versus other branded ammunition products is important, it is not the only factor in product selection.\n\nCash Flow Data\nEpoxy sales were $1,870.5 million for 2020 compared to $2,024.4 million for 2019, a decrease of $153.9 million, or 8%. The sales decrease was primarily due to lower product prices ($180.0 million) and an unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation ($6.1 million), partially offset by higher volumes ($32.2 million).\nInterest expense increased by $49.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to a higher level of debt outstanding and higher interest rates. Interest expense included $14.6 million of expense related to the 2023 Notes redemption premium and $5.8 million for write-off of deferred debt issuance costs for financing transactions during 2020. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 included $4.0 million and $17.0 million, respectively, of accretion expense related to the ethylene payment discount. Interest expense was reduced by capitalized interest of $6.4 million and $10.8 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nmillion of non-cash impairment charges for equipment and facilities for the year ended December 31, 2019. Restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2019 also included costs associated with permanently closing the ammunition assembly operations at our Geelong, Australia facility in December 2018.\nWinchester reported segment income of $92.3 million for 2020 compared to $40.1 million for 2019, an increase of $52.2 million, or 130%. The increase in segment results was due to increased sales volumes ($49.2 million), which includes ammunition produced at Lake City, and higher product pricing ($23.4 million), partially offset by higher transition costs relating to the Lake City contract ($12.9 million) and higher operating costs ($7.5 million). Winchester segment results included depreciation and amortization expense of $20.1 million in both 2020 and 2019.\nOn July 16, 2019, Olin issued $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior notes due August 1, 2029, which were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Proceeds from the 2029 Notes were used to redeem the remaining balance of the $1,375.0 million term loan facility of $493.0 million and $150.0 million of the Receivables Financing Agreement.\nWe have initiated several on-going actions that we believe will partially mitigate the impact of economic decline on our financial performance, but also enhance our position, financially and structurally, to take advantage of the eventual global economic recovery. Several of these actions and our liquidity resources are summarized below:\n\u2022In May 2020, we entered into a $1,300.0 million senior secured credit facility (Senior Secured Credit Facility) that amended our existing senior credit facility, which provides additional flexibility under our restrictive compliance covenants. The facility includes a $800.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility, of which we have $799.6 million available to us at December 31, 2020, and a $500.0 million senior secured delayed-draw term loan facility which was fully drawn in October 2020 and used to call a portion of the 9.75% senior notes due 2023.\nadditional contingent environmental liabilities of $60 million in addition to the amounts for which we have already recorded as a reserve.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nEnvironmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons, including the identification of new sites, developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies, advances in technology, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application, changes in regulatory authorities, the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites, the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other PRPs and our ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the lengthy time periods over which site remediation occurs. It is possible that some of these matters (the outcomes of which are subject to various uncertainties) may be resolved unfavorably to us, which could materially adversely affect our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.\nUnder the Senior Secured Credit Facility, we may select various floating-rate borrowing options. The actual interest rate paid on borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facility is based on a pricing grid which is dependent upon the net leverage ratio as calculated under the terms of the applicable facility for the prior fiscal quarter. The Senior Secured Credit Facility includes various customary restrictive covenants, including restrictions related to the ratio of secured debt to earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization (secured leverage ratio) and the ratio of earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization to interest expense (coverage ratio). The calculation of secured debt in our secured leverage ratio excludes borrowings under the Receivables Financing Agreement, up to a maximum of $250.0 million. As of December 31, 2020, the only secured borrowings included in the secured leverage ratio were $500.0 million for our Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility and $153.0 million for our Go Zone and Recovery Zone bonds. Compliance with these covenants is determined quarterly. We were in compliance with all covenants and restrictions under all our outstanding credit agreements as of December 31, 2020, and no event of default had occurred that would permit the lenders under our outstanding credit agreements to accelerate the debt if not cured. In the future, our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flows, among other factors, will determine the amounts available to be borrowed under these facilities. As a result of our restrictive covenant related to the secured leverage ratio, the maximum additional borrowings available to us could be limited in the future. The limitation, if an amendment or waiver from our lenders is not obtained, could restrict our ability to borrow the maximum amounts available under the Senior Revolving Credit Facility and the Receivables Financing Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, there were no covenants or other restrictions that limited our ability to borrow.\nGross margin decreased $287.4 million, or 43%, from 2019. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls gross margin decreased by $327.2 million, primarily due to lower caustic soda and EDC pricing and lower volumes, partially offset by lower costs, primarily raw materials. Epoxy gross margin decreased $9.5 million, primarily due to lower product prices, partially offset by lower raw material costs. Winchester gross margin increased $73.5 million, primarily due to higher sales volumes, which included ammunition produced at Lake City, and increased commercial pricing. Gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased to 7% in 2020 from 11% in 2019.\n\u2022As part of our ongoing productivity initiatives to reduce operating costs, during 2020, we reduced overall employee and contractor headcount in our chemicals businesses and corporate functions.\nAs is common in our industry, we are subject to environmental laws and regulations related to the use, storage, handling, generation, transportation, emission, discharge, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes in all of the countries in which we do business.\nOn October 15, 2020, Olin redeemed $600.0 million of the outstanding 9.75% senior notes due 2023 (2023 Notes). The 2023 Notes were redeemed at 102.438% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes, resulting in a redemption premium of $14.6 million. The 2023 Notes were redeemed by drawing on our $500.0 million senior secured delayed-draw term loan facility (Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility) along with utilizing $114.6 million of cash on hand.\nDuring 2019, we made a discretionary cash contribution to our domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan of $12.5 million. Based on our plan assumptions and estimates, we will not be required to make any cash contributions to the domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan at least through 2021.\nEpoxy reported segment income of $40.8 million for 2020 compared to $53.9 million for 2019, a decrease of $13.1 million, or 24%. The decrease in segment results was primarily due to lower product prices ($180.0 million) and an unfavorable product mix ($24.4 million), partially offset by lower raw material costs ($162.5 million), primarily benzene and\nWe believe the assumptions used in our goodwill impairment analysis are appropriate and result in reasonable estimates of the implied fair value of each reporting unit. However, given the economic environment and the uncertainties regarding the impact on our business, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions, made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing, will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. If our assumptions regarding future performance are not achieved, or if our stock price experiences further sustained declines, we may be required to record additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods. It is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or, if it does, whether such charge would be material.\nFor 2020, other corporate and unallocated costs were $154.3 million compared to $156.3 million for 2019, a decrease of $2.0 million, or 1%. The decrease was primarily due to lower salary and benefit costs of $12.2 million and lower travel-related expenses of $2.1 million, partially offset by higher stock-based compensation expense of $14.8 million, which includes mark-to-market adjustments. Other corporate and unallocated costs included costs associated with the implementation of the Information Technology Project for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 of $73.9 million and $77.0 million, respectively.\nDERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nAt December 31, 2020, we had total letters of credit of $80.4 million outstanding, of which $0.4 million were issued under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility. The letters of credit were used to support certain long-term debt, certain workers compensation insurance policies, certain plant closure and post-closure obligations, certain international payment obligations and certain international pension funding requirements.\nOther operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018 included an $8.0 million insurance recovery for a second quarter 2017 business interruption at our Freeport, TX vinyl chloride monomer facility partially offset by a $1.7 million loss on the sale of land.\nThe effective tax rate for 2019 included benefits associated with the finalization of the IRS review of years 2013 to 2015 U.S. income tax claims, stock-based compensation, prior year tax positions, foreign tax law changes, a remeasurement of deferred taxes due to a decrease in our state effective tax rates and a change in tax contingencies. The effective tax rate also included expenses associated with a net increase in the valuation allowance primarily related to foreign deferred tax assets and liabilities. These factors resulted in a net $19.4 million tax benefit. After giving consideration to these items, the effective tax rate for 2019 of 16.8% was lower than the 21% U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state taxes and a net increase in the valuation allowance related to losses in foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by foreign income taxes and favorable permanent salt depletion deductions. The effective tax rate for 2018 included benefits associated with the U.S. Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (2017 Tax Act), stock-based compensation, changes in tax contingencies, a foreign dividend payment, changes associated with prior year tax positions and the remeasurement of deferred taxes due to a decrease in our state effective tax rates. The effective tax rate also included expenses associated with a net increase in the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions and the remeasurement of deferred taxes due to changes in our foreign tax rates. These factors resulted in a net $2.9 million tax benefit, of which $3.8 million related to the increase of the 2017 Tax Act benefit. After giving consideration to these items, the effective tax rate for 2018 of 25.7% was higher than the 21% U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state and foreign income taxes, foreign income inclusions and a net increase in the valuation allowance related to current year losses in foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by favorable permanent salt depletion deductions.\nOur Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment is partially a commodity business where all supplier products are similar and price is the major supplier selection criterion. Pricing for these products is subject to a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control. Our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment produces some of the most widely used chemicals in the world that can be upgraded into a wide variety of downstream chemical products used in many end-markets. Changes in supply/demand, can be abrupt and significant and, given capacity in our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment, can lead to significant changes in our overall profitability.\n\u2022In May 2020, we issued $500.0 million 9.50% senior notes due 2025 (2025 Notes). Proceeds from the 2025 Notes provided additional liquidity and were used for general corporate purposes.\n2020 Compared to 2019\nNon-operating pension income includes all components of pension and other postretirement income (costs) other than service costs. Non-operating pension income was higher for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to a decrease in the amortization of actuarial losses associated with our domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan.\nOther Corporate and Unallocated costs in 2021 are expected to be lower than the $154.3 million in 2020, primarily due to 2020 results including $73.9 million of costs associated with the Information Technology Project. The Information Technology Project was substantially completed during 2020. Partially offsetting these lower costs in 2021 will be higher management incentive expense, including mark-to-market adjustments on stock-based compensation expense.\nDuring 2018, we settled certain disputes with respect to insurance coverage for costs at various environmental remediation sites for $121.0 million. Environmental expense (income) for the year ended December 31, 2018 include insurance recoveries for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods of $111.0 million. The recoveries are reduced by estimated liabilities of $10.0 million associated with claims by subsequent owners of certain of the settled environmental sites. Environmental expense (income) for the year ended December 31, 2019 included $4.8 million of recoveries associated with resolving the outstanding third party claims against the proceeds from the 2018 environmental insurance settlement.\nPENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS\nLIQUIDITY, INVESTMENT ACTIVITY AND OTHER FINANCIAL DATA\nOn May 8, 2020, we entered into a $1,300.0 million Senior Secured Credit Facility that amended the existing 2019 Senior Credit Facility. The Senior Secured Credit Facility included a Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility with aggregate commitments of $500.0 million and a Senior Revolving Credit Facility with aggregate commitments in an amount equal to $800.0 million. The maturity date for the Senior Secured Credit Facility is July 16, 2024. The amendment modified the financial covenants of the Senior Secured Credit Facility to be less restrictive and expanded the permitted use of proceeds of the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility to include general corporate purposes.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSales for 2019 were $6,110.0 million compared to $6,946.1 million in 2018, a decrease of $836.1 million, or 12%. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls sales decreased by $566.6 million primarily due to lower caustic soda pricing. Epoxy sales decreased by $278.7 million primarily due to lower product prices and an unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation. Winchester sales increased by $9.2 million primarily due to higher ammunition sales to commercial customers.\nOperating Activities\nDecember 31, 2019, as a result of a higher level of debt outstanding and lower shareholders' equity primarily resulting from the goodwill impairment charge.\nWinchester\nSubsequent Event\nNo impairment charges were recorded for 2019 or 2018.\nIn 2021, we currently expect our capital spending to be in the $200 million range, which would be approximately $100 million lower than 2020 levels. We expect 2021 depreciation and amortization expense to be in the $575 million to $600 million range.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, our market capitalization declined significantly compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Over the same period, the equity value of our peer group companies and the overall U.S. stock market also declined significantly amid market volatility. These declines were driven by the uncertainty surrounding the outbreak of the COVID-19 global pandemic and other macroeconomic events impacting the various industries in which Olin and our peers participate. Additionally, the various governmental, business and consumer responses to the pandemic were expected to have a negative impact on the near-term demand for several of the products produced by our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls and Epoxy businesses. The full extent and duration of the impact of COVID-19 on our operations and financial performance was unknown at the time. As a result of these events, we identified triggering events associated with a significant overall decrease in our stock price, a significant adverse change in the business climate and a significant reduction in near-term cash flow projections and performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test during the first quarter of 2020. We used a discounted cash flow approach to develop the estimated fair value of our reporting units. Based on the aforementioned analysis, the estimated fair value of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value of the reporting units and no impairment charges were recorded.\nOn July 16, 2019, our existing $250.0 million Receivables Financing Agreement was extended to July 15, 2022 and downsized to $10.0 million with the option to expand (Receivables Financing Agreement). In 2020, we amended the Receivables Financing Agreement to expand the borrowing capacity to $250.0 million. The Receivables Financing Agreement includes a minimum borrowing requirement of 50% of the facility limit or available borrowing capacity, whichever is lesser. The administrative agent for our Receivables Financing Agreement is PNC Bank, National Association. Under the Receivables Financing Agreement, our eligible trade receivables are used for collateralized borrowings and continue to be serviced by us. In addition, the Receivables Financing Agreement incorporates the secured leverage covenant that is contained in the Senior Secured Credit Facility. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the outstanding balance of the $250.0 million Receivables Financing Agreement of $150.0 million was repaid with proceeds from the issuance of 2029 Notes. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $125.0 million and zero, respectively, drawn under the agreement. As of December 31, 2020, $332.8 million of our trade receivables were pledged as collateral. As of December 31, 2020, we had $124.0 million of additional borrowing capacity under the Receivables Financing Agreement.\nIn 2017, we began a multi-year implementation of the Information Technology Project. The project standardized business processes across the chemicals businesses with the objective of maximizing cost effectiveness, efficiency and control across our global operations. The project was completed during 2020. Our results for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 include $41.0 million, $56.0 million and $84.5 million, respectively, of capital spending and $73.9 million, $77.0 million and $36.5 million, respectively, of expenses associated with this project.\nWe still believe there is a high degree of economic uncertainty in the global markets in which we participate and we believe the steps we have taken and will continue to take to enhance our capital structure and liquidity have strengthened our ability to operate through the current conditions.\nThe spread of the pandemic and the associated response has caused significant disruptions in the U.S. and global economies, resulting in the disruption of the supply and demand fundamentals of our Chemicals businesses. The various governmental, business and consumer responses to the pandemic negatively impacted the demand for several of the products produced by our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls and Epoxy businesses resulting in lower volumes and pricing. We are monitoring the changing business environment, volatility and heightened degree of uncertainty resulting from the response to COVID-19. At the current time, we are unable to fully determine its future impact on our business. We continue to work with our customers, employees, suppliers and communities to address the impacts of COVID-19 and we continue to assess possible implications to our business, supply chain and customers, and to take actions in an effort to mitigate adverse consequences.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\nThroughout the second and third quarters of 2020, the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated response has caused significant disruptions in the U.S. and global economies, resulting in the disruption of the supply and demand fundamentals of our Chemicals businesses. The various governmental, business and consumer responses to the pandemic continued to negatively impact the demand for several of the products produced by our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls and Epoxy businesses resulting in lower volumes and pricing during 2020 compared to 2019. Due to these factors, the triggering events identified in the first quarter associated with a significant adverse change in the business climate and a significant adverse reduction in near-term cash flow projections have persisted during 2020. Throughout the second and third quarters of 2020, the equity value of our peer group companies and the overall U.S. stock market improved significantly while Olin's stock price remained low. During the three months ended September 30, 2020, we identified a triggering event associated with a sustained significant overall decrease in our stock price. As a result, we performed an updated quantitative goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of 2020. We used a discounted cash flow approach to develop the estimated fair value of our reporting units.\n\u2022We executed a strategy to improve our working capital and manage our balance sheet to maximize our financial flexibility. During 2020, Olin reduced working capital by approximately $142 million, which included an approximately $67 million investment in working capital to support Lake City operations.\nRestructurings\nGoodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and/or when circumstances or other events indicate that impairment may have occurred. ASC 350 Intangibles-Goodwill and Other\u201d (ASC 350) permits entities to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the goodwill impairment test. Circumstances that are considered as part of the qualitative assessment and could trigger a quantitative impairment test include, but are not limited to: a significant adverse change in the business climate; a significant adverse legal judgment; adverse cash flow trends; an adverse action or assessment by a government agency; unanticipated competition; sustained decline in our stock price; and a significant restructuring charge within a reporting unit. We define reporting units at the business segment level or one level below the business segment level. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to our reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit.\nEpoxy\nAs a further indicator that each reporting unit has been valued appropriately using a discounted cash flow model, the aggregate fair value of all reporting units is reconciled to the total market value of Olin. Due to the sustained decline in our stock price, the decrease in the value of our reporting units reflects a market participant's perceived risk in the valuation implied by the sustained reduction in our stock price. As a result of this assessment, the carrying values of our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls and Epoxy reporting units exceeded the fair values which resulted in pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $557.6 million and $142.2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020. The goodwill impairment charge was calculated as the amount that the carrying value of the reporting unit, including any goodwill, exceeded its fair value and therefore the carrying value of our reporting units equal their fair value upon completion of the goodwill impairment test.\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.\nThe payment of cash dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be determined in light of then-current conditions, including our earnings, our operations, our financial condition, our capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. In the future, our board of directors may change our dividend policy, including the frequency or amount of any dividend, in light of then-existing conditions.\nOlin also has trade accounts receivable factoring arrangements (AR Facilities) and pursuant to the terms of the AR Facilities, certain of our subsidiaries may sell their accounts receivable up to a maximum of $228.0 million. We will continue\nThe effective tax rate for 2020 included expenses associated with a net increase in the valuation allowance related to foreign and domestic tax credits and deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions, a remeasurement of deferred taxes due to an increase in our state effective tax rates and a change in tax contingencies, and stock-based compensation, partially offset by a benefit associated with prior year tax positions. These factors resulted in a net $27.9 million tax expense. For 2020, a tax benefit of $10.8 million was recognized associated with the $699.8 million goodwill impairment charge. After giving consideration to these items, including the goodwill impairment charge on Olin's loss before taxes, the effective tax rate for 2020 of 21.0% was equal to the 21% U.S. federal statutory rate as foreign income taxes, foreign income inclusions and a net increase in the valuation allowance related to losses in foreign jurisdictions were offset by state taxes and favorable permanent salt depletion deductions. The effective tax rate for 2019 included benefits associated with the finalization of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) review of years 2013 to 2015 U.S. income tax claims, stock-based compensation, prior year tax positions, foreign tax law changes, a remeasurement of deferred taxes due to a decrease in our state effective tax rates and a change in tax contingencies. The effective tax rate also included expenses associated with a net increase in the valuation allowance primarily related to foreign deferred tax assets and liabilities. These factors resulted in a net $19.4 million tax benefit. After giving consideration to these items, the effective tax rate for 2019 of 16.8% was lower than the 21% U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state taxes and a net increase in the valuation allowance related to losses in foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by foreign income taxes and favorable permanent salt depletion deductions.\nIn connection with the Acquisition, Olin and Dow entered into arrangements for the long-term supply of ethylene by Dow to Olin, pursuant to which, among other things, Olin made upfront payments in order to receive ethylene at producer economics and for certain reservation fees and for the option to obtain additional future ethylene supply at producer economics. On February 27, 2017, we exercised the remaining option to obtain additional ethylene at producer economics from Dow. In connection with the exercise of this option, we also secured a long-term customer arrangement. As a result, during 2020 an additional payment was made to Dow for $461.0 million.\nOn January 15, 2021, Olin redeemed the remaining $120.0 million of the outstanding 2023 Notes. The 2023 Notes were redeemed at 102.438% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes, resulting in a redemption premium of $2.9 million. The remaining 2023 Notes were redeemed by utilizing $122.9 million of cash on hand.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, a payment of $461.0 million was made associated with long-term supply contracts to reserve additional ethylene at producer economics from Dow and a payment of $75.8 million was made associated with the resolution of a dispute over the allocation to Olin of certain capital costs incurred at our Plaquemine, LA site after the October 5, 2015 closing date of the acquisition of Dow's Chlorine Products business (the Acquisition).\n2019 Compared to 2018\n\nOlin Corporation (the Parent Issuer) issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.50% senior notes due 2025, $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due 2027, $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior notes due 2029 and $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior notes due 2030 (collectively, the Senior Notes) which are wholly and unconditionally guaranteed by Sunbelt Chlor Alkali Partnership, Olin Chlorine 7, LLC, Blue Cube Operations, LLC, Pioneer America LLC, Olin Winchester, LLC and Winchester Ammunition, Inc. (collectively, the Subsidiary Guarantors) and Blue Cube Spinco LLC (the Subsidiary Issuer). The Subsidiary Guarantors and Subsidiary Issuer are fully consolidated subsidiaries of the Parent Issuer. The Subsidiary Issuer issued $720.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.75% senior notes due 2023 and $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 10.00% senior notes due 2025 (collectively, the Blue Cube Notes), which are wholly and unconditionally guaranteed by Olin Corporation (the Parent Guarantor) along with\n2021 OUTLOOK\nWinchester reported segment income of $92.3 million for 2020 compared to $40.1 million for 2019. The increase in segment results was due to increased sales volumes, which includes ammunition produced at Lake City, and higher product pricing, partially offset by transition costs relating to the Lake City contract and higher operating costs. Winchester segment results included depreciation and amortization expense of $20.1 million in both 2020 and 2019.\nDiscussion of new accounting pronouncements can be referred to under Item 8, within Note 3, Recent Accounting Pronouncements.\u201d\nOn January 1, 2019, we sold our 9.1% limited partnership interest in Bay Gas for $20.0 million. The sale closed on February 7, 2019 which resulted in a gain of $11.2 million.\nFair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates and market factors. The discount rate, profitability assumptions and terminal growth rate of our reporting units and the supply and demand fundamentals of the chlor alkali industry were the material assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow model used to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit. The discount rate reflects a weighted-average cost of capital, which is calculated, in part based on observable market data. Some of this data (such as the risk free or treasury rate and the pretax cost of debt) are based on the market data at a point in time. Other data (such as the equity risk premium) are based upon market data over time for a peer group of companies in the chemical manufacturing or distribution industries with a market capitalization premium added, as applicable. Also factoring into the discount rate was a market participant's perceived risk (such as the company specific risk premium) in the valuation implied by the sustained reduction in our stock price.\nWe also have standby letters of credit of $80.4 million of which $0.4 million have been issued through our Senior Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2020, we had $799.6 million available under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility because we had issued $0.4 million of letters of credit.\nDividends per common share were $0.80 in 2020 and 2019. Total dividends paid on common stock amounted to $126.3 million and $129.3 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. On February 15, 2021, our board of directors declared a dividend of $0.20 per share on our common stock, payable on March 10, 2021 to shareholders of record on March 2, 2021.\nWe define segment results as income (loss) before interest expense, interest income, goodwill impairment charges, other operating income (expense), non-operating pension income, other income and income taxes, and includes the operating results of non-consolidated affiliates. Consistent with the guidance in ASC 280 Segment Reporting,\u201d we have determined it is appropriate to include the operating results of non-consolidated affiliates in the relevant segment financial results. We have three operating segments: Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls, Epoxy and Winchester. The three operating segments reflect the organization used by our management for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. Chlorine used in our Epoxy segment is transferred at cost from the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment. Sales and profits are recognized in the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment for all caustic soda generated and sold by Olin.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, charges to income for environmental investigatory and remedial activities were $20.9 million compared to $20.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. These charges related primarily to expected future investigatory and remedial activities associated with past manufacturing operations and former waste disposal sites. The year ended December 31, 2019 includes a $4.8 million environmental insurance-related settlement gain.\nSelling and administration expenses in 2020 increased $5.1 million, or 1%, from 2019. The increase was primarily due to Lake City operations and higher transition costs relating to the Lake City contract of $22.4 million and higher stock-based compensation expense of $14.7 million, which includes mark-to-market adjustments. These increases were partially offset by lower salaries and benefits of $13.9 million, consulting and contract services of $7.9 million and travel-related expenses of $8.1 million. In 2017, we began a multi-year implementation of new enterprise resource planning, manufacturing and engineering systems, and related infrastructure (collectively, the Information Technology Project). Selling and administration expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 included costs associated with the Information Technology Project of $73.9 million and $77.0 million, respectively. Selling and administration expenses as a percentage of sales were 7% in both 2020 and 2019.\nThe 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic, and the various governmental, business and consumer responses to this pandemic, significantly impacted our results during 2020. We have taken measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, work with our customers and suppliers to minimize potential disruptions and support our communities during this global pandemic. Our operations are among businesses that have been considered essential\u201d by government and public health authorities. We are following all federal, state and local health department guidelines and the costs associated with these safety procedures were not material. We continue to safely maintain plant operations and focus on business continuity. All Olin manufacturing facilities worldwide continue to operate, with the exception of those undergoing planned maintenance turnarounds.\nthe Subsidiary Guarantors. All guarantees are joint and several. This financial information is being presented in relation to the guarantees of the payment of principal, interest and premium (if any) on the Senior Notes and Blue Cube Notes.\n\u2022During 2020, we amended our Receivables Financing Agreement to expand the borrowing capacity to $250.0 million and had outstanding borrowings of $125.0 million as of December 31, 2020. We also have the ability to increase our accounts receivable factoring arrangements, which ultimately can accelerate the timing of cash receipts and enhance our cash position. The Receivables Financing Agreement and accounts receivable factoring arrangements do not impact our Senior Secured Credit Facility debt ratio covenants.\nTotal environmental-related cash outlays for 2021 are estimated to be approximately $210 million, of which approximately $19 million is expected to be spent on investigatory and remedial efforts, approximately $3 million on capital projects and approximately $188 million on normal plant operations. Remedial and investigatory spending is anticipated to be higher in 2021 than 2020 due to the timing of continuing remedial action plans and investigations. Historically, we have funded our environmental capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and expect to do so in the future.\n\nNon-operating pension income includes all components of pension and other postretirement income (costs) other than service costs. Non-operating pension income was lower for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation fees associated with our domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan.\nOn October 15, 2020, Olin drew the entire $500.0 million of the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility. The Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility includes principal amortization amounts payable beginning the quarter ending after the facility is fully drawn at a rate of 5.0% per annum for the first two years, increasing to 7.5% per annum for the following year and to 10.0% per annum for the last two years. The Senior Revolving Credit Facility includes a $100.0 million letter of credit subfacility. At December 31, 2020, we had $799.6 million available under our $800.0 million Senior Revolving Credit Facility because we had issued $0.4 million of letters of credit.\nOn October 15, 2020, Olin redeemed $600.0 million of the outstanding 2023 Notes. The 2023 Notes were redeemed at 102.438% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes, resulting in a redemption premium of $14.6 million. The 2023 Notes were redeemed by drawing $500.0 million of the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility along with utilizing $114.6 million of cash on hand. On January 15, 2021, Olin redeemed the remaining $120.0 million of the outstanding 2023 Notes. The 2023 Notes were redeemed at 102.438% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes, resulting in a redemption premium of $2.9 million. The remaining 2023 Notes were redeemed by utilizing $122.9 million of cash on hand.\n2019 Compared to 2018\nChlor Alkali Products and Vinyls sales for 2019 were $3,420.1 million compared to $3,986.7 million for 2018, a decrease of $566.6 million, or 14%. The sales decrease was primarily due to lower product pricing, primarily caustic soda, and lower volumes.\nIn 2017, we began a multi-year implementation of the Information Technology Project. The project standardized business processes across the chemicals businesses with the objective of maximizing cost effectiveness, efficiency and control across our global operations. The project was completed in 2020. Our results for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 include $41.0 million, $56.0 million and $84.5 million, respectively, of capital spending and $73.9 million, $77.0 million and $36.5 million, respectively, of expenses associated with this project.\nWe have registered an undetermined amount of securities with the SEC, so that, from time-to-time, we may issue debt securities, preferred stock and/or common stock and associated warrants in the public market under that registration statement.\nNet loss was $969.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net loss of $11.3 million for 2019. The decrease in results from the prior year was primarily due to a goodwill impairment charge of $699.8 million and lower Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment results, primarily due to lower pricing and volumes. Partially offsetting these declines were higher Winchester segment results.\nDuring 2021, we anticipate environmental expenses in the $20 million to $25 million range compared to $20.9 million in 2020.\nChlor Alkali Products and Vinyls\nRestructuring charges in 2020 and 2019 were primarily associated with the March 2016 closure of 433,000 tons of chlor alkali capacity across three separate locations. Restructuring charges for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were also associated with the closure of a chlor alkali plant and a VDC production facility, both in Freeport, TX, and included $58.9\nincluded costs associated with permanently closing the ammunition assembly operations at our Geelong, Australia facility in December 2018. Restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2018 also included charges associated with permanently closing a portion of the Becancour, Canada chlor alkali facility in 2014.\nThe service cost component of net periodic benefit (income) costs related to employees of the operating segments are allocated to the operating segments based on their respective estimated census data.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the projected benefit obligation of $3,199.4 million exceeded the market value of assets in our qualified defined benefit pension plans by $730.3 million, as calculated under ASC 715.\nWinchester sales were $665.5 million for 2019 compared to $656.3 million for 2018, an increase of $9.2 million, or 1%. The sales increase was primarily due to higher ammunition sales to commercial customers ($13.7 million), partially offset by decreased sales to military customers and law enforcement agencies ($4.5 million).\nSupplemental Guarantor Financial Information\nOur principal sources of liquidity are from cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations and borrowings under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility, Receivables Financing Agreement and AR Facilities. Additionally, we believe that we have access to the debt and equity markets.\n(7)Other income for the year ended December 31, 2019 included a gain of $11.2 million on the sale of our equity interest in a non-consolidated affiliate.\n\nWe have several defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans, as described in Note 13 Pension Plans\u201d and Note 17 Contributing Employee Ownership Plan\u201d in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. We fund the defined benefit pension plans based on the minimum amounts required by law plus such amounts we deem\nThe percent of total debt to total capitalization increased to 72.7% at December 31, 2020 compared to 58.0% at\nIn August 2019, we terminated the interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges which resulted in a loss of $2.3 million that will be deferred as an offset to the carrying value of the related debt and will be recognized to interest expense through October 2025. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, $0.4 million, $2.6 million and $2.1 million,\nChlor Alkali Products and Vinyls generated segment income of $336.7 million for 2019 compared to $637.1 million for 2018, a decrease of $300.4 million, or 47%. The decrease in Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment results was primarily due to lower product prices ($449.4 million), primarily caustic soda, and lower volumes ($53.0 million), partially offset by lower raw material and operating costs ($138.1 million) and lower maintenance turnaround costs ($42.4 million). Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls 2018 segment results were also negatively impacted by a non-cash impairment charge associated with our investment in a non-consolidated affiliate ($21.5 million). Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment results included depreciation and amortization expense of $470.4 million and $473.1 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOn July 16, 2019, Olin entered into a five-year, $2,000.0 million senior credit facility (2019 Senior Credit Facility), which replaced the existing $1,975.0 million senior credit facility (2017 Senior Credit Facility). In December 2019, Olin amended the 2019 Senior Credit Facility which amended the restrictive covenants of the agreement, including expanding the coverage and leverage ratios to be less restrictive over the next two and a half years. The 2019 Senior Credit Facility included a senior unsecured delayed-draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1,200.0 million and an $800.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility.\nOn December 11, 2019, we announced that we had made the decision to permanently close a chlor alkali plant with a capacity of 230,000 tons and our VDC production facility, both in Freeport, TX. The VDC facility was closed during the fourth quarter of 2020. The related chlor alkali plant closure is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded pretax restructuring charges of $3.8 million for facility exit costs and employee severance and related benefit costs related to these actions. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded pretax restructuring charges of $58.9 million for facility exit costs and non-cash impairment of equipment and facilities related to these actions.\nChlor Alkali Products and Vinyls generated segment income of $3.5 million for 2020 compared to $336.7 million for 2019, a decrease of $333.2 million. The decrease in Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment results was primarily due to lower product prices ($318.5 million), primarily caustic soda and EDC, and lower volumes ($143.1 million), primarily caustic soda. Partially offsetting these decreases were lower raw material costs ($83.8 million) and lower maintenance turnaround and operating costs ($44.6 million). Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment results included depreciation and amortization expense of $451.4 million and $470.4 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOn July 16, 2019, Olin issued $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior notes due August 1, 2029 (2029 Notes), which were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Proceeds from the 2029 Notes were used to redeem the remaining balance of the $1,375.0 million Term Loan Facility of $493.0 million and $150.0 million of the Receivables Financing Agreement.\nCorporate/Other\nWe expect non-operating pension income in 2021 to be in the $30 million to $35 million range compared to $18.9 million in 2020. Based on our plan assumptions and estimates, we will not be required to make any cash contributions to our domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2021. We have several international qualified defined benefit pension plans for which we anticipate cash contributions of less than $5 million in 2020.\nOur current debt structure is used to fund our business operations. As of December 31, 2020, we had long-term borrowings, including the current installment and finance lease obligations, of $3,863.8 million, of which $780.9 million was at variable rates. Annual maturities of long-term debt, including finance lease obligations, are $26.3 million in 2021, $351.1 million in 2022, $158.4 million in 2023, $483.3 million in 2024, $1,003.1 million in 2025 and a total of $1,883.0 million thereafter. Commitments from banks under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility, Receivables Financing Agreement and AR Facilities are an additional source of liquidity. Included within the $3,863.8 million of long-term borrowings on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 were unamortized deferred debt issuance costs, unamortized bond original issue discount and deferred losses on fair value interest rate swaps of $41.4 million.\nThe following tables present summarized financial information of the Parent Guarantor, Subsidiary Guarantors, Parent Issuer and Subsidiary Issuer on a combined basis after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances among the guarantors and issuers and (ii) equity (loss) in earnings from and investments in any subsidiary that is a non-guarantor subsidiary or issuer.\nIt is our practice, at a minimum, to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter every three years. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we performed our triennial quantitative goodwill impairment test for our reporting units. We use a discounted cash flow approach to develop the estimated fair value of a reporting unit when a quantitative review is performed. Management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model. We also corroborate our discounted cash flow analysis by evaluating a market-based approach that considers earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) multiples from a representative sample of comparable public companies. As a further indicator that each reporting unit has been valued appropriately using a discounted cash flow model, the aggregate fair value of all reporting units is reconciled to the total market value of Olin. An impairment would be recorded if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the estimated fair value. Based on the aforementioned analysis, the estimated fair value of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value of the reporting units.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND HIGHLIGHTS\n\nCapital spending was $298.9 million and $385.6 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Capital spending was 67% and 78% of depreciation in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOur consolidated balance sheets included liabilities for future environmental expenditures to investigate and remediate known sites amounting to $147.2 million at December 31, 2020, and $139.0 million at December 31, 2019, of which $128.2 million and $122.0 million, respectively, were classified as other noncurrent liabilities. Our environmental liability amounts do not take into account any discounting of future expenditures or any consideration of insurance recoveries or advances in technology. These liabilities are reassessed periodically to determine if environmental circumstances have changed and/or remediation efforts and our estimate of related costs have changed. As a result of these reassessments, future charges to income may be made for additional liabilities. Of the $147.2 million included on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2020 for future environmental expenditures, we currently expect to utilize $88.5 million of the reserve for future environmental expenditures over the next 5 years, $27.6 million for expenditures 6 to 10 years in the future, and $31.1 million for expenditures beyond 10 years in the future. These estimates are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, as described in Environmental Costs\u201d contained in Item 1A - Risk Factors.\u201d\nto service the outstanding accounts sold. These receivables qualify for sales treatment under ASC 860 Transfers and Servicing\u201d and, accordingly, the proceeds are included in net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The gross amount of receivables sold for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 totaled $854.3 million and $984.8 million, respectively. The factoring discount paid under the AR Facilities is recorded as interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations. The factoring discount for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $1.5 million and $2.9 million, respectively. The agreements are without recourse and therefore no recourse liability has been recorded as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, $48.8 million and $63.1 million, respectively, of receivables qualifying for sales treatment were outstanding and will continue to be serviced by us.\nIn connection with international qualified defined benefit pension plans, we made cash contributions of $2.1 million, $2.4 million and $2.6 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and we anticipate less than $5 million of cash contributions to international qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2021.\nEpoxy reported segment income of $40.8 million for 2020 compared to $53.9 million for 2019. Epoxy segment results were lower than in the prior year primarily due to lower product prices, partially offset by lower raw material costs. Epoxy segment results included depreciation and amortization expense of $90.7 million and $100.1 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nEnvironmental provisions charged (credited) to income, which are included in cost of goods sold, were as follows:\n\u2022During 2020, we suspended the defined contribution plan match on all salaried and non-bargaining hourly employees' contributions.\n\u2022During 2020, our capital expenditures were approximately $87 million lower than 2019 and we are forecasting capital spending to be in the $200 million range in 2021, which would be an additional $100 million lower than 2020 levels.\nGoodwill\nBUSINESS BACKGROUND\nOur total estimated environmental liability at December 31, 2020 was attributable to 58 sites, 14 of which were United States Environmental Protection Agency National Priority List sites. Nine sites accounted for 82% of our environmental liability and, of the remaining 49 sites, no one site accounted for more than 3% of our environmental liability. At seven of the nine sites, part of the site is in the long-term OM&M stage. At six of the nine sites, we are implementing a remedial action plan for part of the site. At five of the nine sites, a remedial design is being developed at part of the site and at four of the nine sites, part of the site is subject to a remedial investigation. All nine sites are either associated with past manufacturing operations or former waste disposal sites. None of the nine largest sites represents more than 23% of the liabilities reserved on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2020 for future environmental expenditures.\nChlor Alkali Products and Vinyls generated segment income of $3.5 million for 2020 compared to $336.7 million for 2019. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment results were lower than in the prior year primarily due to lower pricing, primarily caustic soda and ethylene dichloride (EDC), and lower volumes, primarily caustic soda. These decreases were partially offset by lower costs, including raw materials and operating costs. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment results included depreciation and amortization expense of $451.4 million and $470.4 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe are party to various government and private environmental actions associated with past manufacturing facilities and former waste disposal sites. Associated costs of investigatory and remedial activities are provided for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles governing probability and the ability to reasonably estimate future costs. Our ability to estimate future costs depends on whether our investigatory and remedial activities are in preliminary or advanced stages. With respect to unasserted claims, we accrue liabilities for costs that, in our experience, we expect to incur to protect our interests against those unasserted claims. Our accrued liabilities for unasserted claims amounted to $9.0 million at December 31, 2020. With respect to asserted claims, we accrue liabilities based on remedial investigation, feasibility study, remedial action and operation, maintenance and monitoring (OM&M) expenses that, in our experience, we expect to incur in connection with the asserted claims. Required site OM&M expenses are estimated and accrued in their entirety for required periods not exceeding 30 years, which reasonably approximates the typical duration of long-term site OM&M.\nCapital Expenditures\nInvesting Activities\nFor 2019, cash provided by operating activities decreased by $290.5 million from 2018, primarily due to a decrease in operating results partially offset by a decrease in the investment in working capital from the prior year. For 2019, working capital decreased $11.0 million compared to an increase of $71.6 million in 2018. Receivables decreased from December 31, 2018 by $12.3 million primarily as a result of lower sales in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 partially offset by a decrease in receivables sold under the accounts receivable factoring arrangement. In 2019, inventories decreased by $13.0 million and accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased by $11.0 million. The decreases in inventories and accounts payable were primarily due to lower raw material costs.\nCapital spending was $298.9 million and $385.6 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Capital spending was 67% and 78% of depreciation in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nChlor Alkali Products and Vinyls sales for 2020 were $2,959.9 million compared to $3,420.1 million for 2019, a decrease of $460.2 million, or 13%. The sales decrease was primarily due to lower caustic soda and EDC pricing and lower volumes, primarily caustic soda.\n(1)Losses of non-consolidated affiliates are included in the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment results consistent with management's monitoring of the operating segment. The losses of non-consolidated affiliates were $19.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which reflected a $21.5 million non-cash impairment charge.\nIn 2020, we paid debt issuance costs of $10.3 million, primarily for the issuance of the 2025 Notes and amendments to our Senior Secured Credit Facility and Receivables Financing Agreement. In 2019, we paid debt issuance costs of $16.6 million, primarily for the issuance of the 2029 Notes and the 2019 Senior Credit Facility.\nRestructuring charges in 2019 included $58.9 million of non-cash impairment charges for equipment and facilities associated with the closure of a chlor alkali plant and a VDC production facility, both in Freeport, TX. Restructuring charges in 2019 and 2018 were also associated with the March 2016 closure of 433,000 tons of chlor alkali capacity across three separate locations and the December 2018 decision to permanently close the ammunition assembly operations at our Winchester facility in Geelong, Australia.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was impacted by a lower level of average debt outstanding partially offset by higher interest rates compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 included $17.0 million and $16.0 million, respectively, of accretion expense related to the ethylene payment discount. Interest expense was reduced by capitalized interest of $10.8 million and $6.0 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOur foreign currency forward contracts and certain commodity derivatives did not meet the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting. The effect on operating results of items not qualifying for hedge accounting was a gain (loss) of $17.7 million, $(4.0) million and $(5.4) million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nPlease see the discussion of legal matters and contingencies within Item 8, under the heading of Legal Matters\u201d within Note 23, Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d\nItem 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(1)Excludes unamortized debt issuance costs, unamortized bond original issue discount and deferred losses on fair value interest rate swaps of $41.4 million at December 31, 2020. All debt obligations are assumed to be held until maturity.\nOn May 19, 2020, Olin issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.50% senior notes due June 1, 2025. The 2025 Notes were issued at 99.5% of par value, the discount from which is included within long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheet. Interest on the 2025 Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on December 1, 2020. Proceeds from the 2025 Notes were used for general corporate purposes.\nAnnual environmental-related cash outlays for site investigation and remediation, capital projects and normal plant operations are expected to range between $200 million to $220 million over the next several years, $15 million to $25 million of which is for investigatory and remedial efforts, which are expected to be charged against reserves recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. While we do not anticipate a material increase in the projected annual level of our environmental-related cash outlays for site investigation and remediation, there is always the possibility that such an increase may occur in the future in view of the uncertainties associated with environmental exposures.\nOn July 16, 2019, Olin also entered into a five-year, $2,000.0 million senior credit facility, which replaced the existing 2017 Senior Credit Facility. In December 2019, Olin amended the 2019 Senior Credit Facility which amended the restrictive covenants of the agreement, including expanding the coverage and leverage ratios to be less restrictive over the next two and a half years. The 2019 Senior Credit Facility included a senior unsecured delayed-draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1,200.0 million and an $800.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility.\nIn 2020, no shares were repurchased. In 2019, we repurchased and retired 8.0 million shares with a total value of $145.9 million.\nCash outlays for remedial and investigatory activities associated with former waste sites and past operations were not charged to income but instead were charged to reserves established for such costs identified and expensed to income in prior years. Cash outlays for normal plant operations for the disposal of waste and the operation and maintenance of pollution control equipment and facilities to ensure compliance with mandated and voluntarily imposed environmental quality standards were charged to income.\nGoodwill impairment includes non-cash pretax impairment charges of $557.6 million related to the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment and $142.2 million related to the Epoxy segment.\nOur long-term contractual commitments, including the on and off-balance sheet arrangements, consisted of the following:\nFor 2019, other corporate and unallocated costs were $156.3 million compared to $158.3 million for 2018, a decrease of $2.0 million, or 1%. The decrease was primarily due to lower legal and legal-related settlement expenses of $17.7 million, primarily due to the legal fees associated with the environmental recovery actions in 2018, decreased management incentive expense of $9.4 million, which includes mark-to-market adjustments on stock-based compensation expense, a favorable foreign currency impact of $8.2 million and lower consulting charges of $6.4 million. These decreases were partially offset by higher costs associated with the Information Technology Project of $40.5 million.\nLIQUIDITY AND OTHER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS\nOn October 15, 2020, Olin redeemed $600.0 million of the outstanding 9.75% senior notes due 2023. The 2023 Notes were redeemed at 102.438% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes, resulting in a redemption premium of $14.6 million. The 2023 Notes were redeemed by drawing $500.0 million of the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility along with utilizing $114.6 million of cash on hand.\n2019 Compared to 2018\nWe also use interest rate swaps as a means of managing interest expense and floating interest rate exposure to optimal levels. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings. We include the gain or loss on the hedged items (fixed-rate borrowings) in the same line item, interest expense, as the offsetting loss or gain on the related interest rate swaps.\nNon-cancelable operating leases and purchasing commitments are utilized in our normal course of business for our projected needs. Our operating lease commitments are primarily for railroad cars, but also include logistics, manufacturing, office and storage facilities and equipment, information technology equipment and land. Virtually none of our lease agreements contain escalation clauses or step rent provisions. We have supply contracts with various third parties for certain raw materials, including ethylene, electricity, propylene and benzene. These contracts have initial terms ranging from several to 20 years. For losses that we believe are probable and which are estimable, we have accrued for such amounts in our consolidated balance sheets. In addition to the table above, we have various commitments and contingencies including: defined benefit and postretirement healthcare plans (as described below), environmental matters (see discussion under Environmental Matters\u201d) and litigation claims (see discussion under Item 8, under the heading of Legal Matters\u201d within Note 23, Commitments and Contingencies\u201d).\n(3)Other corporate and unallocated costs for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 included costs associated with the implementation of the Information Technology Project of $73.9 million, $77.0 million and $36.5 million, respectively.\n(2)Environmental (expense) income for the year ended December 31, 2019 included $4.8 million of an environmental insurance-related settlement gain. Environmental (expense) income for the year ended December 31, 2018 included pre-tax insurance recoveries for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods of $111.0 million. Environmental (expense) income is included in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOn October 1, 2020, Winchester assumed full management and operational control of the Lake City facility in Independence, MO. The U.S. Army selected Winchester to operate and manage the Lake City facility in September 2019. The contract has an initial term of seven years and may be extended by the U.S. Army for up to three additional years.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nappropriate. We have postretirement healthcare plans that provide health and life insurance benefits to certain retired employees and their beneficiaries, as described in Note 14 Postretirement Benefits\u201d in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. The defined contribution and other postretirement plans are not pre-funded and expenses are paid by us as incurred.\n2019 Compared to 2018\n2020 Compared to 2019\nWe are a leading vertically-integrated global manufacturer and distributor of chemical products and a leading U.S. manufacturer of ammunition. Our operations are concentrated in three business segments: Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls, Epoxy and Winchester. All of our business segments are capital intensive manufacturing businesses. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls operating rates are closely tied to the general economy. Each segment has a commodity element to it.\nWe use cash flow hedges for certain raw material and energy costs such as copper, zinc, lead, ethane, electricity and natural gas to provide a measure of stability in managing our exposure to price fluctuations associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials and energy used in our manufacturing process. Settlements on commodity derivative contracts resulted in (losses) gains of $(14.9) million, $(31.1) million, and $5.4 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively which were included in cost of goods sold. At December 31, 2020, we had open derivative notional contract positions through 2027 totaling $214.1 million (2019-$174.6 million). If all open futures contracts had been settled on December 31, 2020, we would have recognized a pretax gain of $28.4 million.\n(3)Given the inherent uncertainty as to actual minimum funding requirements for qualified defined benefit pension plans, no amounts are included in this table for any period beyond one year. Based on the current funding requirements, we will not be required to make any cash contributions to the domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan at least through 2021.\nThe amendment also requires that the obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facility be guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries, which are also guarantors of Olin's outstanding notes, with the exception of the $200.0 million senior notes due 2022. The obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facility are also secured by liens on substantially all of Olin's and the subsidiary guarantors' personal property (Collateral), other than certain principal properties and capital stock of subsidiaries, and subject to certain other exceptions. The amendment provides that substantially all guarantees under the Senior Secured Credit Facility and liens on the Collateral may be released when our net leverage ratio is below 3.50 to 1.00 for two consecutive fiscal quarters.\n(5)Other operating income for the year ended December 31, 2020 included an $0.8 million gain on the sale of land. Other operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018 included an $8.0 million insurance recovery for a second quarter 2017 business interruption at our Freeport, TX vinyl chloride monomer facility partially offset by a $1.7 million loss on the sale of land.\nSubsequent Event\nSales for 2020 were $5,758.0 million compared to $6,110.0 million in 2019, a decrease of $352.0 million, or 6%. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls sales decreased by $460.2 million, primarily due to lower caustic soda and EDC pricing and lower volumes, primarily caustic soda. Epoxy sales decreased by $153.9 million, primarily due to lower product prices. Winchester sales increased by $262.1 million, primarily due to higher commercial and military sales volumes, which included ammunition produced at Lake City, and increased commercial ammunition pricing.\npropylene, and lower operating costs ($38.8 million). Epoxy segment results were also negatively affected by a first quarter 2020 force majeure declaration by a European phenol supplier, which reduced epoxy resin and epoxy resin precursor production, and Epoxy manufacturing plant closures and operating reductions in Asia due to COVID-19 ($10.0 million). A significant percentage of our Euro denominated sales are of products manufactured within Europe. As a result, the impact of foreign currency translation on revenue is primarily offset by the impact of foreign currency translation on raw materials and manufacturing costs also denominated in Euros. Epoxy segment results included depreciation and amortization expense of $90.7 million and $100.1 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWinchester reported segment income of $40.1 million for 2019 compared to $38.4 million for 2018, an increase of $1.7 million, or 4%. The increase in segment results was primarily due to lower costs ($8.7 million), primarily commodity and other material costs, partially offset by lower product prices ($6.6 million) and a less favorable product mix ($0.4 million). Winchester segment results included depreciation and amortization expense of $20.1 million and $20.0 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to our purchases of certain commodities, our ongoing investing and financing activities and our operations that use foreign currencies. The risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows and future earnings. We have established policies and procedures governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage exposure to such risks. ASC 815 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and measure those instruments at fair value. In accordance with ASC 815, we designate derivative contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted purchases of commodities and forecasted interest payments related to variable-rate borrowings and designate certain interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of fixed-rate borrowings. We do not enter into any derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nOn May 19, 2020, Olin issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.50% senior notes due June 1, 2025. The 2025 Notes were issued at 99.5% of par value, the discount from which is included within long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheet. Interest on the 2025 Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on December 1, 2020. Proceeds from the 2025 Notes were used for general corporate purposes.\n\nEnvironmental\n\nThe overall cash decrease of $31.2 million in 2020 primarily reflects our payments under long-term supply contracts, capital spending and dividends paid, partially offset by borrowings under the 2025 Notes and a decrease in working capital. We believe, based on current and projected levels of cash flow from our operations, together with our cash and cash equivalents on hand and the availability to borrow under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility, Receivables Financing Agreement and AR Facilities, we have sufficient liquidity to meet our short-term and long-term needs to make required payments of interest on our debt, fund our operating needs, working capital, and capital expenditure requirements and comply with the financial ratios in our debt agreements.\nWinchester sales were $927.6 million for 2020 compared to $665.5 million for 2019, an increase of $262.1 million, or 39%. The increase was due to higher ammunition sales to commercial customers ($199.2 million) and military customers ($51.9 million), both of which include ammunition produced at Lake City, and law enforcement agencies ($11.0 million).\n2019 Compared to 2018\nSelling and administration expenses in 2019 decreased $13.7 million, or 3%, from 2018. The years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 included costs associated with the Information Technology Project of $77.0 million and $36.5 million, respectively, an increase of $40.5 million. More than offsetting this increase were lower legal and legal-related settlement expenses of $19.3 million, primarily due to the legal fees associated with the environmental recovery actions in 2018, lower consulting and contract services of $13.7 million, lower management incentive compensation expense of $10.2 million, which includes mark-to-market adjustments on stock-based compensation expense, and a favorable foreign currency impact of $8.5 million. Selling and administration expenses as a percentage of sales were 7% in 2019 and 6% in 2018.\nIn 2021, we expect our capital spending to be in the $200 million range, which is expected to be an additional $100 million lower than 2020 levels.\n\nFinancing Activities\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Significant estimates in our consolidated financial statements include goodwill recoverability, environmental, restructuring and other unusual items, litigation, income tax reserves including deferred tax asset valuation allowances, pension, postretirement and other benefits and allowance for doubtful accounts. We base our estimates on prior experience, current facts and circumstances and other assumptions. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nAccruals (charges to income) for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, based upon current law and existing technologies. These amounts, which are not discounted and are exclusive of claims against third parties, are adjusted periodically as assessments and remediation efforts progress or additional technical or legal information becomes available. Environmental costs are capitalized if the costs increase the value of the property and/or mitigate or prevent contamination from future operations. Environmental costs and recoveries are included in costs of goods sold.\n2020 Compared to 2019\n\u2022We believe that we have access to both the high-yield debt and equity markets at this time.\nFor 2020, cash provided by operating activities decreased by $198.9 million from 2019, primarily due to a decrease in operating results, partially offset by a decrease in the investment in working capital from the prior year. During 2020, we executed a strategy to improve our working capital and manage our balance sheet to maximize our financial flexibility. For 2020, working capital decreased $141.6 million, which included an approximately $67 million investment in working capital to support Lake City operations, compared to a decrease of $11.0 million in 2019. In 2020, inventories decreased by $28.6 million, primarily as a result of lower raw material costs and lower Winchester inventory due to improved commercial ammunition demand, partially offset by the investment in Lake City inventory. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by $149.3 million as a result of specific actions taken by management to improve Olin's working capital.\n2020 Overview\nOn January 18, 2021, we announced we had made the decision to permanently close our trichloroethylene and anhydrous hydrogen chloride liquefaction facilities in Freeport, TX, before the end of 2021. We expect to incur restructuring charges through 2023 of approximately $23 million related to these actions, approximately $2 million of which is expected to be incurred in 2021. These restructuring costs are expected to consist of $21 million of facility exit costs and $2 million of contract termination costs.\nIn 2021, we expect to continue to implement and benefit from Olin's new operating model of optimizing value across our chemicals businesses. Olin drove sequential pricing improvement in the fourth quarter 2020 for chlorine and almost all chlorine derivatives, including epoxy resins. During 2021, we expect to deliver ECU pricing improvement compared to 2020, partially offset by lower volumes as we continue to selectively sell less into poor quality markets and remain disciplined in our approach to both sides of the ECU. In 2021, we expect year over year improvement in both Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls and Epoxy segment results. During 2021, productivity efforts are also expected to result in lower operating costs across our chemical businesses.\nOur liabilities for future environmental expenditures were as follows:\n(2)For the purposes of this table, we have assumed for all periods presented that there are no changes in the rates from those in effect at December 31, 2020 which ranged from 0.21% to 10.00%.\nThese charges relate primarily to remedial and investigatory activities associated with past manufacturing operations and former waste disposal sites and may be material to operating results in future years.\nEpoxy reported segment income of $53.9 million for 2019 compared to $52.8 million for 2018, an increase of $1.1 million, or 2%. The increase in segment results was primarily due to lower maintenance costs and unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs associated with maintenance turnarounds ($40.0 million), decreased operating costs ($18.1 million) and lower raw material costs ($214.1 million), primarily benzene and propylene, partially offset by lower product prices ($258.9 million) and an unfavorable product mix ($12.2 million). A significant percentage of our Euro denominated sales are of products manufactured within Europe. As a result, the impact of foreign currency translation on revenue is primarily offset by the impact of foreign currency translation on raw materials and manufacturing costs also denominated in Euros. Epoxy segment results included depreciation and amortization expense of $100.1 million and $102.4 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe guarantees are subject to release upon the occurrence of certain customary release covenants, including, but not limited to, (i) the sale or other disposition, including the sale of substantially all of the assets or the capital stock, of the applicable subsidiary guarantor, (ii) the release, discharge or other termination of the debt (or the guarantee thereof) which triggered the applicable guarantee requirement, (iii) the legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or discharge of the applicable indenture or (iv) the subsidiary guarantor no longer being a restricted subsidiary under the applicable indenture. There are no significant organizational structure factors, limitations on enforceability of the guarantees, additional restrictions imposed on dividends or other significant factors that would affect payments to the holders of the Senior Notes or Blue Cube Notes.\nIn 2021, we expect our capital spending to be in the $200 million range.\nCOVID-19\nEnvironmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons, including the identification of new sites, developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies, advances in technology, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application, changes in regulatory authorities, the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites, the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other PRPs, our ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the lengthy time periods over which site remediation occurs. It is possible that some of these matters (the outcomes of which are subject to various uncertainties) may be resolved unfavorably to us, which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations. At December 31, 2020, we estimate it is reasonably possible that we may have\n\nOn April 26, 2018, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for the purchase of shares of common stock at an aggregate price of up to $500.0 million. This program will terminate upon the purchase of $500.0 million of our common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2020, there were no shares repurchased. For the year ended December 31, 2019, 8.0 million shares were repurchased and retired at a cost of $145.9 million. As of December 31, 2020, a total of 10.1 million shares were repurchased and retired at a cost of $195.9 million and $304.1 million of common stock remained authorized to be repurchased.\nWe currently believe the 2021 effective tax rate will be in the 15% to 20% range, while we expect cash taxes will be in the range of $15 million, which primarily reflects the utilization of domestic tax loss carryforwards.\n(4)These amounts are only estimated payments assuming for our foreign qualified pension plans a weighted average annual expected rate of return on pension plan assets of 4.4% and a discount rate on pension plan obligations of 0.8%. These estimated payments are subject to significant variation and the actual payments may be more than the amounts estimated. In connection with international qualified defined benefit pension plans we made cash contributions of $2.1 million, $2.4 million and $2.6 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and we anticipate less than $5 million of cash contributions to international qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2021.\nLEGAL MATTERS AND CONTINGENCIES\nThe discounted cash flow analysis requires estimates, assumptions and judgments about future events. Our analysis uses our internally generated long-range plan. Specifically, the assumptions in our long-range plan about terminal growth rates, forecasted capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements are used to determine the implied fair value of each reporting unit. The long-range plan reflects management judgment, supplemented by independent chemical industry analyses which provide multi-year chlor alkali industry operating and pricing forecasts.\n(4)Restructuring charges for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 included costs associated with the March 2016 closure of 433,000 tons of chlor alkali capacity across three separate locations. Restructuring charges for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were also associated with the closure of a chlor alkali plant and a VDC production facility, both in Freeport, TX, and included $58.9 million of non-cash impairment charges for equipment and facilities for the year ended December 31, 2019. Restructuring charges for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 also\nWe actively manage currency exposures that are associated with net monetary asset positions, currency purchases and sales commitments denominated in foreign currencies and foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. We enter into forward sales and purchase contracts to manage currency risk to offset our net exposures, by currency, related to the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of our operations. At December 31, 2020, we had outstanding forward contracts to buy foreign currency with a notional value of $169.9 million and to sell foreign currency with a notional value of $113.6 million. All of the currency derivatives expire within one year and are for U.S. dollar (USD) equivalents. The counterparties to the forward contracts are large financial institutions; however, the risk of loss to us in the event of nonperformance by a counterparty could impact our financial position or results of operations. At December 31, 2019, we had outstanding forward contracts to buy foreign currency with a notional value of $140.6 million and to sell foreign currency with a notional value of $99.2 million.\nEnergy costs, including electricity and natural gas, and certain raw materials used in our production processes are subject to price volatility. Depending on market conditions, we may enter into futures contracts, forward contracts, commodity swaps and put and call option contracts in order to reduce the impact of commodity price fluctuations. The majority of our commodity derivatives expire within one year.\nThe Epoxy segment consumes some products manufactured by the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment. The Epoxy segment's upstream and midstream products are partially commodity markets. Pricing for these products is subject to a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control. While competitive differentiation exists through downstream customization and product development opportunities, pricing is extremely competitive with a broad range of competitors across the globe.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, net charges to income for environmental investigatory and remedial activities were $20.5 million, which include $4.8 million of an environmental insurance-related settlement gain. For the year ended December 31, 2018, net credits to income for environmental investigatory and remedial activities were $103.7 million, which include $111.0 million of insurance recoveries for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods. Without these recoveries, charges to income for environmental investigatory and remedial activities in 2019 and 2018 would have been $25.3 million and $7.3 million, respectively. The increase in environmental expense from the prior year primarily relates to a $20.0 million increase in costs at a former manufacturing site resulting from revised remediation estimates as a result of agency action. These charges related primarily to expected future investigatory and remedial activities associated with past manufacturing operations and former waste disposal sites.", "item_7_text": "For 2020, cash provided by operating activities decreased by $198.9 million from 2019, primarily due to a decrease in operating results, partially offset by a decrease in the investment in working capital from the prior year. During 2020, we executed a strategy to improve our working capital and manage our balance sheet to maximize our financial flexibility. For 2020, working capital decreased $141.6 million, which included an approximately $67 million investment in working capital to support Lake City operations, compared to a decrease of $11.0 million in 2019. In 2020, inventories decreased by $28.6 million, primarily as a result of lower raw material costs and lower Winchester inventory due to improved commercial ammunition demand, partially offset by the investment in Lake City inventory. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by $149.3 million as a result of specific actions taken by management to improve Olin's working capital.\nThe establishment and implementation of national, state or provincial and local standards to regulate air, water and land quality affect substantially all of our manufacturing locations around the world. Laws providing for regulation of the manufacture, transportation, use and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances, and remediation of contaminated sites, have imposed additional regulatory requirements on industry, particularly the chemicals industry. In addition, implementation of environmental laws has required and will continue to require new capital expenditures and will increase plant operating costs. We employ waste minimization and pollution prevention programs at our manufacturing sites.\nIf commodity prices were to remain at December 31, 2020 levels, approximately $16.6 million of deferred gains, net of tax, would be reclassified into earnings during the next twelve months. The actual effect on earnings will be dependent on actual commodity prices when the forecasted transactions occur.\nWe use interest rate swaps as a means of minimizing cash flow fluctuations that may arise from volatility in interest rates of our variable-rate borrowings. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, $4.3 million and $8.9 million, respectively, of income was recorded to interest expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to these swap agreements.\nOn May 8, 2020, we entered into a $1,300.0 million senior secured credit facility (Senior Secured Credit Facility) that amended our existing five-year, $2,000.0 million senior credit facility. The Senior Secured Credit Facility included a $500.0 million senior secured delayed-draw term loan facility (Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility) and a $800.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (Senior Revolving Credit Facility). The maturity date for the Senior Secured Credit Facility is July 16, 2024. The amendment modified the financial covenants of the Senior Secured Credit Facility to be less restrictive and expanded the permitted use of proceeds of the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility to include general corporate purposes.\n2020 Compared to 2019\nLosses of non-consolidated affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflect a $21.5 million non-cash impairment charge.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our long-term debt borrowings, net of long-term debt repayments, were $80.8 million, which included repayments of $543.0 million related to the $1,375.0 million Term Loan Facility and $150.0 million related to the Receivables Financing Agreement.\n2020 Compared to 2019\nThe fair value of our derivative asset and liability balances were:\nComponents of net periodic benefit (income) costs were:\nWinchester 2021 segment income is expected to improve from 2020 segment income of $92.3 million due to higher commercial product pricing and increased sales volumes, which includes ammunition produced at Lake City. During 2020, Winchester segment results included transition costs related to the Lake City contract of $13.5 million.\nrespectively, of expense was recorded to interest expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to these swap agreements.\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nOn December 10, 2018, we announced that we had made the decision to permanently close the ammunition assembly operations at our Winchester facility in Geelong, Australia. Subsequent to the facility's closure, products for customers in the region are sourced from Winchester manufacturing facilities located in the United States. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded pretax restructuring charges of $0.4 million and $4.1 million, respectively for the write-off of equipment and facility costs, employee severance and related benefit costs, lease and other contract termination costs and facility exit costs related to this action.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, our long-term debt borrowings, net of long-term debt repayments, were $520.3 million, which primarily included borrowings of $500.0 million from the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility, $497.5 million from the issuance of the 2025 Notes and $125.0 million under our Receivables Financing Agreement, partially offset by repayments for the redemption of $600.0 million of the 2023 Notes.\nUnder ASC 715, we recorded an after-tax benefit of $14.8 million ($26.6 million pretax) to shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2020 for our pension and other postretirement plans. This benefit primarily reflected favorable performance on plan assets during 2020, partially offset by a 80-basis point decrease in the domestic pension plans' discount rate. In 2019, we recorded an after-tax charge of $150.2 million ($183.9 million pretax) to shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2019 for our pension and other postretirement plans. This charge primarily reflected a 100-basis point decrease in the domestic pension plans' discount rate, partially offset by favorable performance on plan assets during 2019. In 2018, we recorded an after-tax charge of $74.9 million ($98.5 million pretax) to shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2018 for our pension and other postretirement plans. This charge primarily reflected unfavorable performance on plan assets during 2018, partially offset by a 60-basis point increase in the domestic pension plans' discount rate. These non-cash charges to shareholders' equity do not affect our ability to borrow under our senior secured credit facility.\n(6)Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 included $14.6 million of expense related to the 2023 Notes redemption premium and $5.8 million for the write-off of deferred debt issuance costs associated with financing transactions during 2020. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 included $4.0 million, $17.0 million and $16.0 million, respectively, of accretion expense related to the ethylene payment discount. Interest expense was reduced by capitalized interest of $6.4 million, $10.8 million and $6.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nGross margin decreased $453.2 million, or 40%, from 2018. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls gross margin decreased by $342.1 million, primarily due to lower caustic soda pricing, partially offset by lower raw material and operating costs. Epoxy gross margin decreased $20.6 million primarily due to lower product prices, partially offset by lower raw material costs, primarily benzene and propylene, and lower maintenance and unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs associated with maintenance turnarounds. Winchester gross margin increased $1.2 million primarily due to lower costs, partially offset by lower product prices. Gross margin in 2018 was positively impacted by insurance recoveries for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods of $111.0 million. Gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased to 11% in 2019 from 16% in 2018.\nEpoxy sales were $2,024.4 million for 2019 compared to $2,303.1 million for 2018, a decrease of $278.7 million, or 12%. The sales decrease was primarily due to lower product prices ($258.9 million) and an unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation ($62.5 million), partially offset by increased volumes ($42.7 million).\nWinchester also has a commodity element to its business, but a majority of Winchester ammunition is sold as a branded consumer product where there are opportunities to differentiate certain offerings through innovative new product development and enhanced product performance. While competitive pricing versus other branded ammunition products is important, it is not the only factor in product selection.\n\nCash Flow Data\nEpoxy sales were $1,870.5 million for 2020 compared to $2,024.4 million for 2019, a decrease of $153.9 million, or 8%. The sales decrease was primarily due to lower product prices ($180.0 million) and an unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation ($6.1 million), partially offset by higher volumes ($32.2 million).\nInterest expense increased by $49.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to a higher level of debt outstanding and higher interest rates. Interest expense included $14.6 million of expense related to the 2023 Notes redemption premium and $5.8 million for write-off of deferred debt issuance costs for financing transactions during 2020. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 included $4.0 million and $17.0 million, respectively, of accretion expense related to the ethylene payment discount. Interest expense was reduced by capitalized interest of $6.4 million and $10.8 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nmillion of non-cash impairment charges for equipment and facilities for the year ended December 31, 2019. Restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2019 also included costs associated with permanently closing the ammunition assembly operations at our Geelong, Australia facility in December 2018.\nWinchester reported segment income of $92.3 million for 2020 compared to $40.1 million for 2019, an increase of $52.2 million, or 130%. The increase in segment results was due to increased sales volumes ($49.2 million), which includes ammunition produced at Lake City, and higher product pricing ($23.4 million), partially offset by higher transition costs relating to the Lake City contract ($12.9 million) and higher operating costs ($7.5 million). Winchester segment results included depreciation and amortization expense of $20.1 million in both 2020 and 2019.\nOn July 16, 2019, Olin issued $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior notes due August 1, 2029, which were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Proceeds from the 2029 Notes were used to redeem the remaining balance of the $1,375.0 million term loan facility of $493.0 million and $150.0 million of the Receivables Financing Agreement.\nWe have initiated several on-going actions that we believe will partially mitigate the impact of economic decline on our financial performance, but also enhance our position, financially and structurally, to take advantage of the eventual global economic recovery. Several of these actions and our liquidity resources are summarized below:\n\u2022In May 2020, we entered into a $1,300.0 million senior secured credit facility (Senior Secured Credit Facility) that amended our existing senior credit facility, which provides additional flexibility under our restrictive compliance covenants. The facility includes a $800.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility, of which we have $799.6 million available to us at December 31, 2020, and a $500.0 million senior secured delayed-draw term loan facility which was fully drawn in October 2020 and used to call a portion of the 9.75% senior notes due 2023.\nadditional contingent environmental liabilities of $60 million in addition to the amounts for which we have already recorded as a reserve.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nEnvironmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons, including the identification of new sites, developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies, advances in technology, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application, changes in regulatory authorities, the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites, the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other PRPs and our ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the lengthy time periods over which site remediation occurs. It is possible that some of these matters (the outcomes of which are subject to various uncertainties) may be resolved unfavorably to us, which could materially adversely affect our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.\nUnder the Senior Secured Credit Facility, we may select various floating-rate borrowing options. The actual interest rate paid on borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facility is based on a pricing grid which is dependent upon the net leverage ratio as calculated under the terms of the applicable facility for the prior fiscal quarter. The Senior Secured Credit Facility includes various customary restrictive covenants, including restrictions related to the ratio of secured debt to earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization (secured leverage ratio) and the ratio of earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization to interest expense (coverage ratio). The calculation of secured debt in our secured leverage ratio excludes borrowings under the Receivables Financing Agreement, up to a maximum of $250.0 million. As of December 31, 2020, the only secured borrowings included in the secured leverage ratio were $500.0 million for our Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility and $153.0 million for our Go Zone and Recovery Zone bonds. Compliance with these covenants is determined quarterly. We were in compliance with all covenants and restrictions under all our outstanding credit agreements as of December 31, 2020, and no event of default had occurred that would permit the lenders under our outstanding credit agreements to accelerate the debt if not cured. In the future, our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flows, among other factors, will determine the amounts available to be borrowed under these facilities. As a result of our restrictive covenant related to the secured leverage ratio, the maximum additional borrowings available to us could be limited in the future. The limitation, if an amendment or waiver from our lenders is not obtained, could restrict our ability to borrow the maximum amounts available under the Senior Revolving Credit Facility and the Receivables Financing Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, there were no covenants or other restrictions that limited our ability to borrow.\nGross margin decreased $287.4 million, or 43%, from 2019. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls gross margin decreased by $327.2 million, primarily due to lower caustic soda and EDC pricing and lower volumes, partially offset by lower costs, primarily raw materials. Epoxy gross margin decreased $9.5 million, primarily due to lower product prices, partially offset by lower raw material costs. Winchester gross margin increased $73.5 million, primarily due to higher sales volumes, which included ammunition produced at Lake City, and increased commercial pricing. Gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased to 7% in 2020 from 11% in 2019.\n\u2022As part of our ongoing productivity initiatives to reduce operating costs, during 2020, we reduced overall employee and contractor headcount in our chemicals businesses and corporate functions.\nAs is common in our industry, we are subject to environmental laws and regulations related to the use, storage, handling, generation, transportation, emission, discharge, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes in all of the countries in which we do business.\nOn October 15, 2020, Olin redeemed $600.0 million of the outstanding 9.75% senior notes due 2023 (2023 Notes). The 2023 Notes were redeemed at 102.438% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes, resulting in a redemption premium of $14.6 million. The 2023 Notes were redeemed by drawing on our $500.0 million senior secured delayed-draw term loan facility (Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility) along with utilizing $114.6 million of cash on hand.\nDuring 2019, we made a discretionary cash contribution to our domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan of $12.5 million. Based on our plan assumptions and estimates, we will not be required to make any cash contributions to the domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan at least through 2021.\nEpoxy reported segment income of $40.8 million for 2020 compared to $53.9 million for 2019, a decrease of $13.1 million, or 24%. The decrease in segment results was primarily due to lower product prices ($180.0 million) and an unfavorable product mix ($24.4 million), partially offset by lower raw material costs ($162.5 million), primarily benzene and\nWe believe the assumptions used in our goodwill impairment analysis are appropriate and result in reasonable estimates of the implied fair value of each reporting unit. However, given the economic environment and the uncertainties regarding the impact on our business, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions, made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing, will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. If our assumptions regarding future performance are not achieved, or if our stock price experiences further sustained declines, we may be required to record additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods. It is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or, if it does, whether such charge would be material.\nFor 2020, other corporate and unallocated costs were $154.3 million compared to $156.3 million for 2019, a decrease of $2.0 million, or 1%. The decrease was primarily due to lower salary and benefit costs of $12.2 million and lower travel-related expenses of $2.1 million, partially offset by higher stock-based compensation expense of $14.8 million, which includes mark-to-market adjustments. Other corporate and unallocated costs included costs associated with the implementation of the Information Technology Project for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 of $73.9 million and $77.0 million, respectively.\nDERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nAt December 31, 2020, we had total letters of credit of $80.4 million outstanding, of which $0.4 million were issued under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility. The letters of credit were used to support certain long-term debt, certain workers compensation insurance policies, certain plant closure and post-closure obligations, certain international payment obligations and certain international pension funding requirements.\nOther operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018 included an $8.0 million insurance recovery for a second quarter 2017 business interruption at our Freeport, TX vinyl chloride monomer facility partially offset by a $1.7 million loss on the sale of land.\nThe effective tax rate for 2019 included benefits associated with the finalization of the IRS review of years 2013 to 2015 U.S. income tax claims, stock-based compensation, prior year tax positions, foreign tax law changes, a remeasurement of deferred taxes due to a decrease in our state effective tax rates and a change in tax contingencies. The effective tax rate also included expenses associated with a net increase in the valuation allowance primarily related to foreign deferred tax assets and liabilities. These factors resulted in a net $19.4 million tax benefit. After giving consideration to these items, the effective tax rate for 2019 of 16.8% was lower than the 21% U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state taxes and a net increase in the valuation allowance related to losses in foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by foreign income taxes and favorable permanent salt depletion deductions. The effective tax rate for 2018 included benefits associated with the U.S. Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (2017 Tax Act), stock-based compensation, changes in tax contingencies, a foreign dividend payment, changes associated with prior year tax positions and the remeasurement of deferred taxes due to a decrease in our state effective tax rates. The effective tax rate also included expenses associated with a net increase in the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions and the remeasurement of deferred taxes due to changes in our foreign tax rates. These factors resulted in a net $2.9 million tax benefit, of which $3.8 million related to the increase of the 2017 Tax Act benefit. After giving consideration to these items, the effective tax rate for 2018 of 25.7% was higher than the 21% U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state and foreign income taxes, foreign income inclusions and a net increase in the valuation allowance related to current year losses in foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by favorable permanent salt depletion deductions.\nOur Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment is partially a commodity business where all supplier products are similar and price is the major supplier selection criterion. Pricing for these products is subject to a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control. Our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment produces some of the most widely used chemicals in the world that can be upgraded into a wide variety of downstream chemical products used in many end-markets. Changes in supply/demand, can be abrupt and significant and, given capacity in our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment, can lead to significant changes in our overall profitability.\n\u2022In May 2020, we issued $500.0 million 9.50% senior notes due 2025 (2025 Notes). Proceeds from the 2025 Notes provided additional liquidity and were used for general corporate purposes.\n2020 Compared to 2019\nNon-operating pension income includes all components of pension and other postretirement income (costs) other than service costs. Non-operating pension income was higher for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to a decrease in the amortization of actuarial losses associated with our domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan.\nOther Corporate and Unallocated costs in 2021 are expected to be lower than the $154.3 million in 2020, primarily due to 2020 results including $73.9 million of costs associated with the Information Technology Project. The Information Technology Project was substantially completed during 2020. Partially offsetting these lower costs in 2021 will be higher management incentive expense, including mark-to-market adjustments on stock-based compensation expense.\nDuring 2018, we settled certain disputes with respect to insurance coverage for costs at various environmental remediation sites for $121.0 million. Environmental expense (income) for the year ended December 31, 2018 include insurance recoveries for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods of $111.0 million. The recoveries are reduced by estimated liabilities of $10.0 million associated with claims by subsequent owners of certain of the settled environmental sites. Environmental expense (income) for the year ended December 31, 2019 included $4.8 million of recoveries associated with resolving the outstanding third party claims against the proceeds from the 2018 environmental insurance settlement.\nPENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS\nLIQUIDITY, INVESTMENT ACTIVITY AND OTHER FINANCIAL DATA\nOn May 8, 2020, we entered into a $1,300.0 million Senior Secured Credit Facility that amended the existing 2019 Senior Credit Facility. The Senior Secured Credit Facility included a Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility with aggregate commitments of $500.0 million and a Senior Revolving Credit Facility with aggregate commitments in an amount equal to $800.0 million. The maturity date for the Senior Secured Credit Facility is July 16, 2024. The amendment modified the financial covenants of the Senior Secured Credit Facility to be less restrictive and expanded the permitted use of proceeds of the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility to include general corporate purposes.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSales for 2019 were $6,110.0 million compared to $6,946.1 million in 2018, a decrease of $836.1 million, or 12%. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls sales decreased by $566.6 million primarily due to lower caustic soda pricing. Epoxy sales decreased by $278.7 million primarily due to lower product prices and an unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation. Winchester sales increased by $9.2 million primarily due to higher ammunition sales to commercial customers.\nOperating Activities\nDecember 31, 2019, as a result of a higher level of debt outstanding and lower shareholders' equity primarily resulting from the goodwill impairment charge.\nWinchester\nSubsequent Event\nNo impairment charges were recorded for 2019 or 2018.\nIn 2021, we currently expect our capital spending to be in the $200 million range, which would be approximately $100 million lower than 2020 levels. We expect 2021 depreciation and amortization expense to be in the $575 million to $600 million range.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, our market capitalization declined significantly compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Over the same period, the equity value of our peer group companies and the overall U.S. stock market also declined significantly amid market volatility. These declines were driven by the uncertainty surrounding the outbreak of the COVID-19 global pandemic and other macroeconomic events impacting the various industries in which Olin and our peers participate. Additionally, the various governmental, business and consumer responses to the pandemic were expected to have a negative impact on the near-term demand for several of the products produced by our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls and Epoxy businesses. The full extent and duration of the impact of COVID-19 on our operations and financial performance was unknown at the time. As a result of these events, we identified triggering events associated with a significant overall decrease in our stock price, a significant adverse change in the business climate and a significant reduction in near-term cash flow projections and performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test during the first quarter of 2020. We used a discounted cash flow approach to develop the estimated fair value of our reporting units. Based on the aforementioned analysis, the estimated fair value of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value of the reporting units and no impairment charges were recorded.\nOn July 16, 2019, our existing $250.0 million Receivables Financing Agreement was extended to July 15, 2022 and downsized to $10.0 million with the option to expand (Receivables Financing Agreement). In 2020, we amended the Receivables Financing Agreement to expand the borrowing capacity to $250.0 million. The Receivables Financing Agreement includes a minimum borrowing requirement of 50% of the facility limit or available borrowing capacity, whichever is lesser. The administrative agent for our Receivables Financing Agreement is PNC Bank, National Association. Under the Receivables Financing Agreement, our eligible trade receivables are used for collateralized borrowings and continue to be serviced by us. In addition, the Receivables Financing Agreement incorporates the secured leverage covenant that is contained in the Senior Secured Credit Facility. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the outstanding balance of the $250.0 million Receivables Financing Agreement of $150.0 million was repaid with proceeds from the issuance of 2029 Notes. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $125.0 million and zero, respectively, drawn under the agreement. As of December 31, 2020, $332.8 million of our trade receivables were pledged as collateral. As of December 31, 2020, we had $124.0 million of additional borrowing capacity under the Receivables Financing Agreement.\nIn 2017, we began a multi-year implementation of the Information Technology Project. The project standardized business processes across the chemicals businesses with the objective of maximizing cost effectiveness, efficiency and control across our global operations. The project was completed during 2020. Our results for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 include $41.0 million, $56.0 million and $84.5 million, respectively, of capital spending and $73.9 million, $77.0 million and $36.5 million, respectively, of expenses associated with this project.\nWe still believe there is a high degree of economic uncertainty in the global markets in which we participate and we believe the steps we have taken and will continue to take to enhance our capital structure and liquidity have strengthened our ability to operate through the current conditions.\nThe spread of the pandemic and the associated response has caused significant disruptions in the U.S. and global economies, resulting in the disruption of the supply and demand fundamentals of our Chemicals businesses. The various governmental, business and consumer responses to the pandemic negatively impacted the demand for several of the products produced by our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls and Epoxy businesses resulting in lower volumes and pricing. We are monitoring the changing business environment, volatility and heightened degree of uncertainty resulting from the response to COVID-19. At the current time, we are unable to fully determine its future impact on our business. We continue to work with our customers, employees, suppliers and communities to address the impacts of COVID-19 and we continue to assess possible implications to our business, supply chain and customers, and to take actions in an effort to mitigate adverse consequences.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\nThroughout the second and third quarters of 2020, the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated response has caused significant disruptions in the U.S. and global economies, resulting in the disruption of the supply and demand fundamentals of our Chemicals businesses. The various governmental, business and consumer responses to the pandemic continued to negatively impact the demand for several of the products produced by our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls and Epoxy businesses resulting in lower volumes and pricing during 2020 compared to 2019. Due to these factors, the triggering events identified in the first quarter associated with a significant adverse change in the business climate and a significant adverse reduction in near-term cash flow projections have persisted during 2020. Throughout the second and third quarters of 2020, the equity value of our peer group companies and the overall U.S. stock market improved significantly while Olin's stock price remained low. During the three months ended September 30, 2020, we identified a triggering event associated with a sustained significant overall decrease in our stock price. As a result, we performed an updated quantitative goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of 2020. We used a discounted cash flow approach to develop the estimated fair value of our reporting units.\n\u2022We executed a strategy to improve our working capital and manage our balance sheet to maximize our financial flexibility. During 2020, Olin reduced working capital by approximately $142 million, which included an approximately $67 million investment in working capital to support Lake City operations.\nRestructurings\nGoodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and/or when circumstances or other events indicate that impairment may have occurred. ASC 350 Intangibles-Goodwill and Other\u201d (ASC 350) permits entities to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the goodwill impairment test. Circumstances that are considered as part of the qualitative assessment and could trigger a quantitative impairment test include, but are not limited to: a significant adverse change in the business climate; a significant adverse legal judgment; adverse cash flow trends; an adverse action or assessment by a government agency; unanticipated competition; sustained decline in our stock price; and a significant restructuring charge within a reporting unit. We define reporting units at the business segment level or one level below the business segment level. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to our reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit.\nEpoxy\nAs a further indicator that each reporting unit has been valued appropriately using a discounted cash flow model, the aggregate fair value of all reporting units is reconciled to the total market value of Olin. Due to the sustained decline in our stock price, the decrease in the value of our reporting units reflects a market participant's perceived risk in the valuation implied by the sustained reduction in our stock price. As a result of this assessment, the carrying values of our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls and Epoxy reporting units exceeded the fair values which resulted in pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $557.6 million and $142.2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020. The goodwill impairment charge was calculated as the amount that the carrying value of the reporting unit, including any goodwill, exceeded its fair value and therefore the carrying value of our reporting units equal their fair value upon completion of the goodwill impairment test.\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.\nThe payment of cash dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be determined in light of then-current conditions, including our earnings, our operations, our financial condition, our capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. In the future, our board of directors may change our dividend policy, including the frequency or amount of any dividend, in light of then-existing conditions.\nOlin also has trade accounts receivable factoring arrangements (AR Facilities) and pursuant to the terms of the AR Facilities, certain of our subsidiaries may sell their accounts receivable up to a maximum of $228.0 million. We will continue\nThe effective tax rate for 2020 included expenses associated with a net increase in the valuation allowance related to foreign and domestic tax credits and deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions, a remeasurement of deferred taxes due to an increase in our state effective tax rates and a change in tax contingencies, and stock-based compensation, partially offset by a benefit associated with prior year tax positions. These factors resulted in a net $27.9 million tax expense. For 2020, a tax benefit of $10.8 million was recognized associated with the $699.8 million goodwill impairment charge. After giving consideration to these items, including the goodwill impairment charge on Olin's loss before taxes, the effective tax rate for 2020 of 21.0% was equal to the 21% U.S. federal statutory rate as foreign income taxes, foreign income inclusions and a net increase in the valuation allowance related to losses in foreign jurisdictions were offset by state taxes and favorable permanent salt depletion deductions. The effective tax rate for 2019 included benefits associated with the finalization of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) review of years 2013 to 2015 U.S. income tax claims, stock-based compensation, prior year tax positions, foreign tax law changes, a remeasurement of deferred taxes due to a decrease in our state effective tax rates and a change in tax contingencies. The effective tax rate also included expenses associated with a net increase in the valuation allowance primarily related to foreign deferred tax assets and liabilities. These factors resulted in a net $19.4 million tax benefit. After giving consideration to these items, the effective tax rate for 2019 of 16.8% was lower than the 21% U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state taxes and a net increase in the valuation allowance related to losses in foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by foreign income taxes and favorable permanent salt depletion deductions.\nIn connection with the Acquisition, Olin and Dow entered into arrangements for the long-term supply of ethylene by Dow to Olin, pursuant to which, among other things, Olin made upfront payments in order to receive ethylene at producer economics and for certain reservation fees and for the option to obtain additional future ethylene supply at producer economics. On February 27, 2017, we exercised the remaining option to obtain additional ethylene at producer economics from Dow. In connection with the exercise of this option, we also secured a long-term customer arrangement. As a result, during 2020 an additional payment was made to Dow for $461.0 million.\nOn January 15, 2021, Olin redeemed the remaining $120.0 million of the outstanding 2023 Notes. The 2023 Notes were redeemed at 102.438% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes, resulting in a redemption premium of $2.9 million. The remaining 2023 Notes were redeemed by utilizing $122.9 million of cash on hand.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, a payment of $461.0 million was made associated with long-term supply contracts to reserve additional ethylene at producer economics from Dow and a payment of $75.8 million was made associated with the resolution of a dispute over the allocation to Olin of certain capital costs incurred at our Plaquemine, LA site after the October 5, 2015 closing date of the acquisition of Dow's Chlorine Products business (the Acquisition).\n2019 Compared to 2018\n\nOlin Corporation (the Parent Issuer) issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.50% senior notes due 2025, $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due 2027, $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior notes due 2029 and $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior notes due 2030 (collectively, the Senior Notes) which are wholly and unconditionally guaranteed by Sunbelt Chlor Alkali Partnership, Olin Chlorine 7, LLC, Blue Cube Operations, LLC, Pioneer America LLC, Olin Winchester, LLC and Winchester Ammunition, Inc. (collectively, the Subsidiary Guarantors) and Blue Cube Spinco LLC (the Subsidiary Issuer). The Subsidiary Guarantors and Subsidiary Issuer are fully consolidated subsidiaries of the Parent Issuer. The Subsidiary Issuer issued $720.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.75% senior notes due 2023 and $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 10.00% senior notes due 2025 (collectively, the Blue Cube Notes), which are wholly and unconditionally guaranteed by Olin Corporation (the Parent Guarantor) along with\n2021 OUTLOOK\nWinchester reported segment income of $92.3 million for 2020 compared to $40.1 million for 2019. The increase in segment results was due to increased sales volumes, which includes ammunition produced at Lake City, and higher product pricing, partially offset by transition costs relating to the Lake City contract and higher operating costs. Winchester segment results included depreciation and amortization expense of $20.1 million in both 2020 and 2019.\nDiscussion of new accounting pronouncements can be referred to under Item 8, within Note 3, Recent Accounting Pronouncements.\u201d\nOn January 1, 2019, we sold our 9.1% limited partnership interest in Bay Gas for $20.0 million. The sale closed on February 7, 2019 which resulted in a gain of $11.2 million.\nFair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates and market factors. The discount rate, profitability assumptions and terminal growth rate of our reporting units and the supply and demand fundamentals of the chlor alkali industry were the material assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow model used to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit. The discount rate reflects a weighted-average cost of capital, which is calculated, in part based on observable market data. Some of this data (such as the risk free or treasury rate and the pretax cost of debt) are based on the market data at a point in time. Other data (such as the equity risk premium) are based upon market data over time for a peer group of companies in the chemical manufacturing or distribution industries with a market capitalization premium added, as applicable. Also factoring into the discount rate was a market participant's perceived risk (such as the company specific risk premium) in the valuation implied by the sustained reduction in our stock price.\nWe also have standby letters of credit of $80.4 million of which $0.4 million have been issued through our Senior Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2020, we had $799.6 million available under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility because we had issued $0.4 million of letters of credit.\nDividends per common share were $0.80 in 2020 and 2019. Total dividends paid on common stock amounted to $126.3 million and $129.3 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. On February 15, 2021, our board of directors declared a dividend of $0.20 per share on our common stock, payable on March 10, 2021 to shareholders of record on March 2, 2021.\nWe define segment results as income (loss) before interest expense, interest income, goodwill impairment charges, other operating income (expense), non-operating pension income, other income and income taxes, and includes the operating results of non-consolidated affiliates. Consistent with the guidance in ASC 280 Segment Reporting,\u201d we have determined it is appropriate to include the operating results of non-consolidated affiliates in the relevant segment financial results. We have three operating segments: Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls, Epoxy and Winchester. The three operating segments reflect the organization used by our management for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. Chlorine used in our Epoxy segment is transferred at cost from the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment. Sales and profits are recognized in the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment for all caustic soda generated and sold by Olin.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, charges to income for environmental investigatory and remedial activities were $20.9 million compared to $20.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. These charges related primarily to expected future investigatory and remedial activities associated with past manufacturing operations and former waste disposal sites. The year ended December 31, 2019 includes a $4.8 million environmental insurance-related settlement gain.\nSelling and administration expenses in 2020 increased $5.1 million, or 1%, from 2019. The increase was primarily due to Lake City operations and higher transition costs relating to the Lake City contract of $22.4 million and higher stock-based compensation expense of $14.7 million, which includes mark-to-market adjustments. These increases were partially offset by lower salaries and benefits of $13.9 million, consulting and contract services of $7.9 million and travel-related expenses of $8.1 million. In 2017, we began a multi-year implementation of new enterprise resource planning, manufacturing and engineering systems, and related infrastructure (collectively, the Information Technology Project). Selling and administration expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 included costs associated with the Information Technology Project of $73.9 million and $77.0 million, respectively. Selling and administration expenses as a percentage of sales were 7% in both 2020 and 2019.\nThe 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic, and the various governmental, business and consumer responses to this pandemic, significantly impacted our results during 2020. We have taken measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, work with our customers and suppliers to minimize potential disruptions and support our communities during this global pandemic. Our operations are among businesses that have been considered essential\u201d by government and public health authorities. We are following all federal, state and local health department guidelines and the costs associated with these safety procedures were not material. We continue to safely maintain plant operations and focus on business continuity. All Olin manufacturing facilities worldwide continue to operate, with the exception of those undergoing planned maintenance turnarounds.\nthe Subsidiary Guarantors. All guarantees are joint and several. This financial information is being presented in relation to the guarantees of the payment of principal, interest and premium (if any) on the Senior Notes and Blue Cube Notes.\n\u2022During 2020, we amended our Receivables Financing Agreement to expand the borrowing capacity to $250.0 million and had outstanding borrowings of $125.0 million as of December 31, 2020. We also have the ability to increase our accounts receivable factoring arrangements, which ultimately can accelerate the timing of cash receipts and enhance our cash position. The Receivables Financing Agreement and accounts receivable factoring arrangements do not impact our Senior Secured Credit Facility debt ratio covenants.\nTotal environmental-related cash outlays for 2021 are estimated to be approximately $210 million, of which approximately $19 million is expected to be spent on investigatory and remedial efforts, approximately $3 million on capital projects and approximately $188 million on normal plant operations. Remedial and investigatory spending is anticipated to be higher in 2021 than 2020 due to the timing of continuing remedial action plans and investigations. Historically, we have funded our environmental capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and expect to do so in the future.\n\nNon-operating pension income includes all components of pension and other postretirement income (costs) other than service costs. Non-operating pension income was lower for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation fees associated with our domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan.\nOn October 15, 2020, Olin drew the entire $500.0 million of the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility. The Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility includes principal amortization amounts payable beginning the quarter ending after the facility is fully drawn at a rate of 5.0% per annum for the first two years, increasing to 7.5% per annum for the following year and to 10.0% per annum for the last two years. The Senior Revolving Credit Facility includes a $100.0 million letter of credit subfacility. At December 31, 2020, we had $799.6 million available under our $800.0 million Senior Revolving Credit Facility because we had issued $0.4 million of letters of credit.\nOn October 15, 2020, Olin redeemed $600.0 million of the outstanding 2023 Notes. The 2023 Notes were redeemed at 102.438% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes, resulting in a redemption premium of $14.6 million. The 2023 Notes were redeemed by drawing $500.0 million of the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility along with utilizing $114.6 million of cash on hand. On January 15, 2021, Olin redeemed the remaining $120.0 million of the outstanding 2023 Notes. The 2023 Notes were redeemed at 102.438% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes, resulting in a redemption premium of $2.9 million. The remaining 2023 Notes were redeemed by utilizing $122.9 million of cash on hand.\n2019 Compared to 2018\nChlor Alkali Products and Vinyls sales for 2019 were $3,420.1 million compared to $3,986.7 million for 2018, a decrease of $566.6 million, or 14%. The sales decrease was primarily due to lower product pricing, primarily caustic soda, and lower volumes.\nIn 2017, we began a multi-year implementation of the Information Technology Project. The project standardized business processes across the chemicals businesses with the objective of maximizing cost effectiveness, efficiency and control across our global operations. The project was completed in 2020. Our results for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 include $41.0 million, $56.0 million and $84.5 million, respectively, of capital spending and $73.9 million, $77.0 million and $36.5 million, respectively, of expenses associated with this project.\nWe have registered an undetermined amount of securities with the SEC, so that, from time-to-time, we may issue debt securities, preferred stock and/or common stock and associated warrants in the public market under that registration statement.\nNet loss was $969.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net loss of $11.3 million for 2019. The decrease in results from the prior year was primarily due to a goodwill impairment charge of $699.8 million and lower Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment results, primarily due to lower pricing and volumes. Partially offsetting these declines were higher Winchester segment results.\nDuring 2021, we anticipate environmental expenses in the $20 million to $25 million range compared to $20.9 million in 2020.\nChlor Alkali Products and Vinyls\nRestructuring charges in 2020 and 2019 were primarily associated with the March 2016 closure of 433,000 tons of chlor alkali capacity across three separate locations. Restructuring charges for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were also associated with the closure of a chlor alkali plant and a VDC production facility, both in Freeport, TX, and included $58.9\nincluded costs associated with permanently closing the ammunition assembly operations at our Geelong, Australia facility in December 2018. Restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2018 also included charges associated with permanently closing a portion of the Becancour, Canada chlor alkali facility in 2014.\nThe service cost component of net periodic benefit (income) costs related to employees of the operating segments are allocated to the operating segments based on their respective estimated census data.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the projected benefit obligation of $3,199.4 million exceeded the market value of assets in our qualified defined benefit pension plans by $730.3 million, as calculated under ASC 715.\nWinchester sales were $665.5 million for 2019 compared to $656.3 million for 2018, an increase of $9.2 million, or 1%. The sales increase was primarily due to higher ammunition sales to commercial customers ($13.7 million), partially offset by decreased sales to military customers and law enforcement agencies ($4.5 million).\nSupplemental Guarantor Financial Information\nOur principal sources of liquidity are from cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations and borrowings under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility, Receivables Financing Agreement and AR Facilities. Additionally, we believe that we have access to the debt and equity markets.\n(7)Other income for the year ended December 31, 2019 included a gain of $11.2 million on the sale of our equity interest in a non-consolidated affiliate.\n\nWe have several defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans, as described in Note 13 Pension Plans\u201d and Note 17 Contributing Employee Ownership Plan\u201d in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. We fund the defined benefit pension plans based on the minimum amounts required by law plus such amounts we deem\nThe percent of total debt to total capitalization increased to 72.7% at December 31, 2020 compared to 58.0% at\nIn August 2019, we terminated the interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges which resulted in a loss of $2.3 million that will be deferred as an offset to the carrying value of the related debt and will be recognized to interest expense through October 2025. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, $0.4 million, $2.6 million and $2.1 million,\nChlor Alkali Products and Vinyls generated segment income of $336.7 million for 2019 compared to $637.1 million for 2018, a decrease of $300.4 million, or 47%. The decrease in Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment results was primarily due to lower product prices ($449.4 million), primarily caustic soda, and lower volumes ($53.0 million), partially offset by lower raw material and operating costs ($138.1 million) and lower maintenance turnaround costs ($42.4 million). Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls 2018 segment results were also negatively impacted by a non-cash impairment charge associated with our investment in a non-consolidated affiliate ($21.5 million). Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment results included depreciation and amortization expense of $470.4 million and $473.1 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOn July 16, 2019, Olin entered into a five-year, $2,000.0 million senior credit facility (2019 Senior Credit Facility), which replaced the existing $1,975.0 million senior credit facility (2017 Senior Credit Facility). In December 2019, Olin amended the 2019 Senior Credit Facility which amended the restrictive covenants of the agreement, including expanding the coverage and leverage ratios to be less restrictive over the next two and a half years. The 2019 Senior Credit Facility included a senior unsecured delayed-draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1,200.0 million and an $800.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility.\nOn December 11, 2019, we announced that we had made the decision to permanently close a chlor alkali plant with a capacity of 230,000 tons and our VDC production facility, both in Freeport, TX. The VDC facility was closed during the fourth quarter of 2020. The related chlor alkali plant closure is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded pretax restructuring charges of $3.8 million for facility exit costs and employee severance and related benefit costs related to these actions. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded pretax restructuring charges of $58.9 million for facility exit costs and non-cash impairment of equipment and facilities related to these actions.\nChlor Alkali Products and Vinyls generated segment income of $3.5 million for 2020 compared to $336.7 million for 2019, a decrease of $333.2 million. The decrease in Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment results was primarily due to lower product prices ($318.5 million), primarily caustic soda and EDC, and lower volumes ($143.1 million), primarily caustic soda. Partially offsetting these decreases were lower raw material costs ($83.8 million) and lower maintenance turnaround and operating costs ($44.6 million). Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment results included depreciation and amortization expense of $451.4 million and $470.4 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOn July 16, 2019, Olin issued $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior notes due August 1, 2029 (2029 Notes), which were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Proceeds from the 2029 Notes were used to redeem the remaining balance of the $1,375.0 million Term Loan Facility of $493.0 million and $150.0 million of the Receivables Financing Agreement.\nCorporate/Other\nWe expect non-operating pension income in 2021 to be in the $30 million to $35 million range compared to $18.9 million in 2020. Based on our plan assumptions and estimates, we will not be required to make any cash contributions to our domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2021. We have several international qualified defined benefit pension plans for which we anticipate cash contributions of less than $5 million in 2020.\nOur current debt structure is used to fund our business operations. As of December 31, 2020, we had long-term borrowings, including the current installment and finance lease obligations, of $3,863.8 million, of which $780.9 million was at variable rates. Annual maturities of long-term debt, including finance lease obligations, are $26.3 million in 2021, $351.1 million in 2022, $158.4 million in 2023, $483.3 million in 2024, $1,003.1 million in 2025 and a total of $1,883.0 million thereafter. Commitments from banks under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility, Receivables Financing Agreement and AR Facilities are an additional source of liquidity. Included within the $3,863.8 million of long-term borrowings on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 were unamortized deferred debt issuance costs, unamortized bond original issue discount and deferred losses on fair value interest rate swaps of $41.4 million.\nThe following tables present summarized financial information of the Parent Guarantor, Subsidiary Guarantors, Parent Issuer and Subsidiary Issuer on a combined basis after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances among the guarantors and issuers and (ii) equity (loss) in earnings from and investments in any subsidiary that is a non-guarantor subsidiary or issuer.\nIt is our practice, at a minimum, to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter every three years. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we performed our triennial quantitative goodwill impairment test for our reporting units. We use a discounted cash flow approach to develop the estimated fair value of a reporting unit when a quantitative review is performed. Management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model. We also corroborate our discounted cash flow analysis by evaluating a market-based approach that considers earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) multiples from a representative sample of comparable public companies. As a further indicator that each reporting unit has been valued appropriately using a discounted cash flow model, the aggregate fair value of all reporting units is reconciled to the total market value of Olin. An impairment would be recorded if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the estimated fair value. Based on the aforementioned analysis, the estimated fair value of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value of the reporting units.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND HIGHLIGHTS\n\nCapital spending was $298.9 million and $385.6 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Capital spending was 67% and 78% of depreciation in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOur consolidated balance sheets included liabilities for future environmental expenditures to investigate and remediate known sites amounting to $147.2 million at December 31, 2020, and $139.0 million at December 31, 2019, of which $128.2 million and $122.0 million, respectively, were classified as other noncurrent liabilities. Our environmental liability amounts do not take into account any discounting of future expenditures or any consideration of insurance recoveries or advances in technology. These liabilities are reassessed periodically to determine if environmental circumstances have changed and/or remediation efforts and our estimate of related costs have changed. As a result of these reassessments, future charges to income may be made for additional liabilities. Of the $147.2 million included on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2020 for future environmental expenditures, we currently expect to utilize $88.5 million of the reserve for future environmental expenditures over the next 5 years, $27.6 million for expenditures 6 to 10 years in the future, and $31.1 million for expenditures beyond 10 years in the future. These estimates are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, as described in Environmental Costs\u201d contained in Item 1A - Risk Factors.\u201d\nto service the outstanding accounts sold. These receivables qualify for sales treatment under ASC 860 Transfers and Servicing\u201d and, accordingly, the proceeds are included in net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The gross amount of receivables sold for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 totaled $854.3 million and $984.8 million, respectively. The factoring discount paid under the AR Facilities is recorded as interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations. The factoring discount for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $1.5 million and $2.9 million, respectively. The agreements are without recourse and therefore no recourse liability has been recorded as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, $48.8 million and $63.1 million, respectively, of receivables qualifying for sales treatment were outstanding and will continue to be serviced by us.\nIn connection with international qualified defined benefit pension plans, we made cash contributions of $2.1 million, $2.4 million and $2.6 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and we anticipate less than $5 million of cash contributions to international qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2021.\nEpoxy reported segment income of $40.8 million for 2020 compared to $53.9 million for 2019. Epoxy segment results were lower than in the prior year primarily due to lower product prices, partially offset by lower raw material costs. Epoxy segment results included depreciation and amortization expense of $90.7 million and $100.1 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nEnvironmental provisions charged (credited) to income, which are included in cost of goods sold, were as follows:\n\u2022During 2020, we suspended the defined contribution plan match on all salaried and non-bargaining hourly employees' contributions.\n\u2022During 2020, our capital expenditures were approximately $87 million lower than 2019 and we are forecasting capital spending to be in the $200 million range in 2021, which would be an additional $100 million lower than 2020 levels.\nGoodwill\nBUSINESS BACKGROUND\nOur total estimated environmental liability at December 31, 2020 was attributable to 58 sites, 14 of which were United States Environmental Protection Agency National Priority List sites. Nine sites accounted for 82% of our environmental liability and, of the remaining 49 sites, no one site accounted for more than 3% of our environmental liability. At seven of the nine sites, part of the site is in the long-term OM&M stage. At six of the nine sites, we are implementing a remedial action plan for part of the site. At five of the nine sites, a remedial design is being developed at part of the site and at four of the nine sites, part of the site is subject to a remedial investigation. All nine sites are either associated with past manufacturing operations or former waste disposal sites. None of the nine largest sites represents more than 23% of the liabilities reserved on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2020 for future environmental expenditures.\nChlor Alkali Products and Vinyls generated segment income of $3.5 million for 2020 compared to $336.7 million for 2019. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment results were lower than in the prior year primarily due to lower pricing, primarily caustic soda and ethylene dichloride (EDC), and lower volumes, primarily caustic soda. These decreases were partially offset by lower costs, including raw materials and operating costs. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment results included depreciation and amortization expense of $451.4 million and $470.4 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe are party to various government and private environmental actions associated with past manufacturing facilities and former waste disposal sites. Associated costs of investigatory and remedial activities are provided for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles governing probability and the ability to reasonably estimate future costs. Our ability to estimate future costs depends on whether our investigatory and remedial activities are in preliminary or advanced stages. With respect to unasserted claims, we accrue liabilities for costs that, in our experience, we expect to incur to protect our interests against those unasserted claims. Our accrued liabilities for unasserted claims amounted to $9.0 million at December 31, 2020. With respect to asserted claims, we accrue liabilities based on remedial investigation, feasibility study, remedial action and operation, maintenance and monitoring (OM&M) expenses that, in our experience, we expect to incur in connection with the asserted claims. Required site OM&M expenses are estimated and accrued in their entirety for required periods not exceeding 30 years, which reasonably approximates the typical duration of long-term site OM&M.\nCapital Expenditures\nInvesting Activities\nFor 2019, cash provided by operating activities decreased by $290.5 million from 2018, primarily due to a decrease in operating results partially offset by a decrease in the investment in working capital from the prior year. For 2019, working capital decreased $11.0 million compared to an increase of $71.6 million in 2018. Receivables decreased from December 31, 2018 by $12.3 million primarily as a result of lower sales in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 partially offset by a decrease in receivables sold under the accounts receivable factoring arrangement. In 2019, inventories decreased by $13.0 million and accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased by $11.0 million. The decreases in inventories and accounts payable were primarily due to lower raw material costs.\nCapital spending was $298.9 million and $385.6 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Capital spending was 67% and 78% of depreciation in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nChlor Alkali Products and Vinyls sales for 2020 were $2,959.9 million compared to $3,420.1 million for 2019, a decrease of $460.2 million, or 13%. The sales decrease was primarily due to lower caustic soda and EDC pricing and lower volumes, primarily caustic soda.\n(1)Losses of non-consolidated affiliates are included in the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment results consistent with management's monitoring of the operating segment. The losses of non-consolidated affiliates were $19.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which reflected a $21.5 million non-cash impairment charge.\nIn 2020, we paid debt issuance costs of $10.3 million, primarily for the issuance of the 2025 Notes and amendments to our Senior Secured Credit Facility and Receivables Financing Agreement. In 2019, we paid debt issuance costs of $16.6 million, primarily for the issuance of the 2029 Notes and the 2019 Senior Credit Facility.\nRestructuring charges in 2019 included $58.9 million of non-cash impairment charges for equipment and facilities associated with the closure of a chlor alkali plant and a VDC production facility, both in Freeport, TX. Restructuring charges in 2019 and 2018 were also associated with the March 2016 closure of 433,000 tons of chlor alkali capacity across three separate locations and the December 2018 decision to permanently close the ammunition assembly operations at our Winchester facility in Geelong, Australia.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was impacted by a lower level of average debt outstanding partially offset by higher interest rates compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 included $17.0 million and $16.0 million, respectively, of accretion expense related to the ethylene payment discount. Interest expense was reduced by capitalized interest of $10.8 million and $6.0 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOur foreign currency forward contracts and certain commodity derivatives did not meet the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting. The effect on operating results of items not qualifying for hedge accounting was a gain (loss) of $17.7 million, $(4.0) million and $(5.4) million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nPlease see the discussion of legal matters and contingencies within Item 8, under the heading of Legal Matters\u201d within Note 23, Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d\nItem 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(1)Excludes unamortized debt issuance costs, unamortized bond original issue discount and deferred losses on fair value interest rate swaps of $41.4 million at December 31, 2020. All debt obligations are assumed to be held until maturity.\nOn May 19, 2020, Olin issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.50% senior notes due June 1, 2025. The 2025 Notes were issued at 99.5% of par value, the discount from which is included within long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheet. Interest on the 2025 Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on December 1, 2020. Proceeds from the 2025 Notes were used for general corporate purposes.\nAnnual environmental-related cash outlays for site investigation and remediation, capital projects and normal plant operations are expected to range between $200 million to $220 million over the next several years, $15 million to $25 million of which is for investigatory and remedial efforts, which are expected to be charged against reserves recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. While we do not anticipate a material increase in the projected annual level of our environmental-related cash outlays for site investigation and remediation, there is always the possibility that such an increase may occur in the future in view of the uncertainties associated with environmental exposures.\nOn July 16, 2019, Olin also entered into a five-year, $2,000.0 million senior credit facility, which replaced the existing 2017 Senior Credit Facility. In December 2019, Olin amended the 2019 Senior Credit Facility which amended the restrictive covenants of the agreement, including expanding the coverage and leverage ratios to be less restrictive over the next two and a half years. The 2019 Senior Credit Facility included a senior unsecured delayed-draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1,200.0 million and an $800.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility.\nIn 2020, no shares were repurchased. In 2019, we repurchased and retired 8.0 million shares with a total value of $145.9 million.\nCash outlays for remedial and investigatory activities associated with former waste sites and past operations were not charged to income but instead were charged to reserves established for such costs identified and expensed to income in prior years. Cash outlays for normal plant operations for the disposal of waste and the operation and maintenance of pollution control equipment and facilities to ensure compliance with mandated and voluntarily imposed environmental quality standards were charged to income.\nGoodwill impairment includes non-cash pretax impairment charges of $557.6 million related to the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment and $142.2 million related to the Epoxy segment.\nOur long-term contractual commitments, including the on and off-balance sheet arrangements, consisted of the following:\nFor 2019, other corporate and unallocated costs were $156.3 million compared to $158.3 million for 2018, a decrease of $2.0 million, or 1%. The decrease was primarily due to lower legal and legal-related settlement expenses of $17.7 million, primarily due to the legal fees associated with the environmental recovery actions in 2018, decreased management incentive expense of $9.4 million, which includes mark-to-market adjustments on stock-based compensation expense, a favorable foreign currency impact of $8.2 million and lower consulting charges of $6.4 million. These decreases were partially offset by higher costs associated with the Information Technology Project of $40.5 million.\nLIQUIDITY AND OTHER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS\nOn October 15, 2020, Olin redeemed $600.0 million of the outstanding 9.75% senior notes due 2023. The 2023 Notes were redeemed at 102.438% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes, resulting in a redemption premium of $14.6 million. The 2023 Notes were redeemed by drawing $500.0 million of the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility along with utilizing $114.6 million of cash on hand.\n2019 Compared to 2018\nWe also use interest rate swaps as a means of managing interest expense and floating interest rate exposure to optimal levels. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings. We include the gain or loss on the hedged items (fixed-rate borrowings) in the same line item, interest expense, as the offsetting loss or gain on the related interest rate swaps.\nNon-cancelable operating leases and purchasing commitments are utilized in our normal course of business for our projected needs. Our operating lease commitments are primarily for railroad cars, but also include logistics, manufacturing, office and storage facilities and equipment, information technology equipment and land. Virtually none of our lease agreements contain escalation clauses or step rent provisions. We have supply contracts with various third parties for certain raw materials, including ethylene, electricity, propylene and benzene. These contracts have initial terms ranging from several to 20 years. For losses that we believe are probable and which are estimable, we have accrued for such amounts in our consolidated balance sheets. In addition to the table above, we have various commitments and contingencies including: defined benefit and postretirement healthcare plans (as described below), environmental matters (see discussion under Environmental Matters\u201d) and litigation claims (see discussion under Item 8, under the heading of Legal Matters\u201d within Note 23, Commitments and Contingencies\u201d).\n(3)Other corporate and unallocated costs for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 included costs associated with the implementation of the Information Technology Project of $73.9 million, $77.0 million and $36.5 million, respectively.\n(2)Environmental (expense) income for the year ended December 31, 2019 included $4.8 million of an environmental insurance-related settlement gain. Environmental (expense) income for the year ended December 31, 2018 included pre-tax insurance recoveries for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods of $111.0 million. Environmental (expense) income is included in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOn October 1, 2020, Winchester assumed full management and operational control of the Lake City facility in Independence, MO. The U.S. Army selected Winchester to operate and manage the Lake City facility in September 2019. The contract has an initial term of seven years and may be extended by the U.S. Army for up to three additional years.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nappropriate. We have postretirement healthcare plans that provide health and life insurance benefits to certain retired employees and their beneficiaries, as described in Note 14 Postretirement Benefits\u201d in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. The defined contribution and other postretirement plans are not pre-funded and expenses are paid by us as incurred.\n2019 Compared to 2018\n2020 Compared to 2019\nWe are a leading vertically-integrated global manufacturer and distributor of chemical products and a leading U.S. manufacturer of ammunition. Our operations are concentrated in three business segments: Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls, Epoxy and Winchester. All of our business segments are capital intensive manufacturing businesses. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls operating rates are closely tied to the general economy. Each segment has a commodity element to it.\nWe use cash flow hedges for certain raw material and energy costs such as copper, zinc, lead, ethane, electricity and natural gas to provide a measure of stability in managing our exposure to price fluctuations associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials and energy used in our manufacturing process. Settlements on commodity derivative contracts resulted in (losses) gains of $(14.9) million, $(31.1) million, and $5.4 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively which were included in cost of goods sold. At December 31, 2020, we had open derivative notional contract positions through 2027 totaling $214.1 million (2019-$174.6 million). If all open futures contracts had been settled on December 31, 2020, we would have recognized a pretax gain of $28.4 million.\n(3)Given the inherent uncertainty as to actual minimum funding requirements for qualified defined benefit pension plans, no amounts are included in this table for any period beyond one year. Based on the current funding requirements, we will not be required to make any cash contributions to the domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan at least through 2021.\nThe amendment also requires that the obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facility be guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries, which are also guarantors of Olin's outstanding notes, with the exception of the $200.0 million senior notes due 2022. The obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facility are also secured by liens on substantially all of Olin's and the subsidiary guarantors' personal property (Collateral), other than certain principal properties and capital stock of subsidiaries, and subject to certain other exceptions. The amendment provides that substantially all guarantees under the Senior Secured Credit Facility and liens on the Collateral may be released when our net leverage ratio is below 3.50 to 1.00 for two consecutive fiscal quarters.\n(5)Other operating income for the year ended December 31, 2020 included an $0.8 million gain on the sale of land. Other operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018 included an $8.0 million insurance recovery for a second quarter 2017 business interruption at our Freeport, TX vinyl chloride monomer facility partially offset by a $1.7 million loss on the sale of land.\nSubsequent Event\nSales for 2020 were $5,758.0 million compared to $6,110.0 million in 2019, a decrease of $352.0 million, or 6%. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls sales decreased by $460.2 million, primarily due to lower caustic soda and EDC pricing and lower volumes, primarily caustic soda. Epoxy sales decreased by $153.9 million, primarily due to lower product prices. Winchester sales increased by $262.1 million, primarily due to higher commercial and military sales volumes, which included ammunition produced at Lake City, and increased commercial ammunition pricing.\npropylene, and lower operating costs ($38.8 million). Epoxy segment results were also negatively affected by a first quarter 2020 force majeure declaration by a European phenol supplier, which reduced epoxy resin and epoxy resin precursor production, and Epoxy manufacturing plant closures and operating reductions in Asia due to COVID-19 ($10.0 million). A significant percentage of our Euro denominated sales are of products manufactured within Europe. As a result, the impact of foreign currency translation on revenue is primarily offset by the impact of foreign currency translation on raw materials and manufacturing costs also denominated in Euros. Epoxy segment results included depreciation and amortization expense of $90.7 million and $100.1 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWinchester reported segment income of $40.1 million for 2019 compared to $38.4 million for 2018, an increase of $1.7 million, or 4%. The increase in segment results was primarily due to lower costs ($8.7 million), primarily commodity and other material costs, partially offset by lower product prices ($6.6 million) and a less favorable product mix ($0.4 million). Winchester segment results included depreciation and amortization expense of $20.1 million and $20.0 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to our purchases of certain commodities, our ongoing investing and financing activities and our operations that use foreign currencies. The risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows and future earnings. We have established policies and procedures governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage exposure to such risks. ASC 815 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and measure those instruments at fair value. In accordance with ASC 815, we designate derivative contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted purchases of commodities and forecasted interest payments related to variable-rate borrowings and designate certain interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of fixed-rate borrowings. We do not enter into any derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nOn May 19, 2020, Olin issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.50% senior notes due June 1, 2025. The 2025 Notes were issued at 99.5% of par value, the discount from which is included within long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheet. Interest on the 2025 Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on December 1, 2020. Proceeds from the 2025 Notes were used for general corporate purposes.\n\nEnvironmental\n\nThe overall cash decrease of $31.2 million in 2020 primarily reflects our payments under long-term supply contracts, capital spending and dividends paid, partially offset by borrowings under the 2025 Notes and a decrease in working capital. We believe, based on current and projected levels of cash flow from our operations, together with our cash and cash equivalents on hand and the availability to borrow under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility, Receivables Financing Agreement and AR Facilities, we have sufficient liquidity to meet our short-term and long-term needs to make required payments of interest on our debt, fund our operating needs, working capital, and capital expenditure requirements and comply with the financial ratios in our debt agreements.\nWinchester sales were $927.6 million for 2020 compared to $665.5 million for 2019, an increase of $262.1 million, or 39%. The increase was due to higher ammunition sales to commercial customers ($199.2 million) and military customers ($51.9 million), both of which include ammunition produced at Lake City, and law enforcement agencies ($11.0 million).\n2019 Compared to 2018\nSelling and administration expenses in 2019 decreased $13.7 million, or 3%, from 2018. The years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 included costs associated with the Information Technology Project of $77.0 million and $36.5 million, respectively, an increase of $40.5 million. More than offsetting this increase were lower legal and legal-related settlement expenses of $19.3 million, primarily due to the legal fees associated with the environmental recovery actions in 2018, lower consulting and contract services of $13.7 million, lower management incentive compensation expense of $10.2 million, which includes mark-to-market adjustments on stock-based compensation expense, and a favorable foreign currency impact of $8.5 million. Selling and administration expenses as a percentage of sales were 7% in 2019 and 6% in 2018.\nIn 2021, we expect our capital spending to be in the $200 million range, which is expected to be an additional $100 million lower than 2020 levels.\n\nFinancing Activities\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Significant estimates in our consolidated financial statements include goodwill recoverability, environmental, restructuring and other unusual items, litigation, income tax reserves including deferred tax asset valuation allowances, pension, postretirement and other benefits and allowance for doubtful accounts. We base our estimates on prior experience, current facts and circumstances and other assumptions. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nAccruals (charges to income) for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, based upon current law and existing technologies. These amounts, which are not discounted and are exclusive of claims against third parties, are adjusted periodically as assessments and remediation efforts progress or additional technical or legal information becomes available. Environmental costs are capitalized if the costs increase the value of the property and/or mitigate or prevent contamination from future operations. Environmental costs and recoveries are included in costs of goods sold.\n2020 Compared to 2019\n\u2022We believe that we have access to both the high-yield debt and equity markets at this time.\nFor 2020, cash provided by operating activities decreased by $198.9 million from 2019, primarily due to a decrease in operating results, partially offset by a decrease in the investment in working capital from the prior year. During 2020, we executed a strategy to improve our working capital and manage our balance sheet to maximize our financial flexibility. For 2020, working capital decreased $141.6 million, which included an approximately $67 million investment in working capital to support Lake City operations, compared to a decrease of $11.0 million in 2019. In 2020, inventories decreased by $28.6 million, primarily as a result of lower raw material costs and lower Winchester inventory due to improved commercial ammunition demand, partially offset by the investment in Lake City inventory. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by $149.3 million as a result of specific actions taken by management to improve Olin's working capital.\n2020 Overview\nOn January 18, 2021, we announced we had made the decision to permanently close our trichloroethylene and anhydrous hydrogen chloride liquefaction facilities in Freeport, TX, before the end of 2021. We expect to incur restructuring charges through 2023 of approximately $23 million related to these actions, approximately $2 million of which is expected to be incurred in 2021. These restructuring costs are expected to consist of $21 million of facility exit costs and $2 million of contract termination costs.\nIn 2021, we expect to continue to implement and benefit from Olin's new operating model of optimizing value across our chemicals businesses. Olin drove sequential pricing improvement in the fourth quarter 2020 for chlorine and almost all chlorine derivatives, including epoxy resins. During 2021, we expect to deliver ECU pricing improvement compared to 2020, partially offset by lower volumes as we continue to selectively sell less into poor quality markets and remain disciplined in our approach to both sides of the ECU. In 2021, we expect year over year improvement in both Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls and Epoxy segment results. During 2021, productivity efforts are also expected to result in lower operating costs across our chemical businesses.\nOur liabilities for future environmental expenditures were as follows:\n(2)For the purposes of this table, we have assumed for all periods presented that there are no changes in the rates from those in effect at December 31, 2020 which ranged from 0.21% to 10.00%.\nThese charges relate primarily to remedial and investigatory activities associated with past manufacturing operations and former waste disposal sites and may be material to operating results in future years.\nEpoxy reported segment income of $53.9 million for 2019 compared to $52.8 million for 2018, an increase of $1.1 million, or 2%. The increase in segment results was primarily due to lower maintenance costs and unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs associated with maintenance turnarounds ($40.0 million), decreased operating costs ($18.1 million) and lower raw material costs ($214.1 million), primarily benzene and propylene, partially offset by lower product prices ($258.9 million) and an unfavorable product mix ($12.2 million). A significant percentage of our Euro denominated sales are of products manufactured within Europe. As a result, the impact of foreign currency translation on revenue is primarily offset by the impact of foreign currency translation on raw materials and manufacturing costs also denominated in Euros. Epoxy segment results included depreciation and amortization expense of $100.1 million and $102.4 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe guarantees are subject to release upon the occurrence of certain customary release covenants, including, but not limited to, (i) the sale or other disposition, including the sale of substantially all of the assets or the capital stock, of the applicable subsidiary guarantor, (ii) the release, discharge or other termination of the debt (or the guarantee thereof) which triggered the applicable guarantee requirement, (iii) the legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or discharge of the applicable indenture or (iv) the subsidiary guarantor no longer being a restricted subsidiary under the applicable indenture. There are no significant organizational structure factors, limitations on enforceability of the guarantees, additional restrictions imposed on dividends or other significant factors that would affect payments to the holders of the Senior Notes or Blue Cube Notes.\nIn 2021, we expect our capital spending to be in the $200 million range.\nCOVID-19\nEnvironmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons, including the identification of new sites, developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies, advances in technology, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application, changes in regulatory authorities, the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites, the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other PRPs, our ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the lengthy time periods over which site remediation occurs. It is possible that some of these matters (the outcomes of which are subject to various uncertainties) may be resolved unfavorably to us, which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations. At December 31, 2020, we estimate it is reasonably possible that we may have\n\nOn April 26, 2018, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for the purchase of shares of common stock at an aggregate price of up to $500.0 million. This program will terminate upon the purchase of $500.0 million of our common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2020, there were no shares repurchased. For the year ended December 31, 2019, 8.0 million shares were repurchased and retired at a cost of $145.9 million. As of December 31, 2020, a total of 10.1 million shares were repurchased and retired at a cost of $195.9 million and $304.1 million of common stock remained authorized to be repurchased.\nWe currently believe the 2021 effective tax rate will be in the 15% to 20% range, while we expect cash taxes will be in the range of $15 million, which primarily reflects the utilization of domestic tax loss carryforwards.\n(4)These amounts are only estimated payments assuming for our foreign qualified pension plans a weighted average annual expected rate of return on pension plan assets of 4.4% and a discount rate on pension plan obligations of 0.8%. These estimated payments are subject to significant variation and the actual payments may be more than the amounts estimated. In connection with international qualified defined benefit pension plans we made cash contributions of $2.1 million, $2.4 million and $2.6 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and we anticipate less than $5 million of cash contributions to international qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2021.\nLEGAL MATTERS AND CONTINGENCIES\nThe discounted cash flow analysis requires estimates, assumptions and judgments about future events. Our analysis uses our internally generated long-range plan. Specifically, the assumptions in our long-range plan about terminal growth rates, forecasted capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements are used to determine the implied fair value of each reporting unit. The long-range plan reflects management judgment, supplemented by independent chemical industry analyses which provide multi-year chlor alkali industry operating and pricing forecasts.\n(4)Restructuring charges for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 included costs associated with the March 2016 closure of 433,000 tons of chlor alkali capacity across three separate locations. Restructuring charges for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were also associated with the closure of a chlor alkali plant and a VDC production facility, both in Freeport, TX, and included $58.9 million of non-cash impairment charges for equipment and facilities for the year ended December 31, 2019. Restructuring charges for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 also\nWe actively manage currency exposures that are associated with net monetary asset positions, currency purchases and sales commitments denominated in foreign currencies and foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. We enter into forward sales and purchase contracts to manage currency risk to offset our net exposures, by currency, related to the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of our operations. At December 31, 2020, we had outstanding forward contracts to buy foreign currency with a notional value of $169.9 million and to sell foreign currency with a notional value of $113.6 million. All of the currency derivatives expire within one year and are for U.S. dollar (USD) equivalents. The counterparties to the forward contracts are large financial institutions; however, the risk of loss to us in the event of nonperformance by a counterparty could impact our financial position or results of operations. At December 31, 2019, we had outstanding forward contracts to buy foreign currency with a notional value of $140.6 million and to sell foreign currency with a notional value of $99.2 million.\nEnergy costs, including electricity and natural gas, and certain raw materials used in our production processes are subject to price volatility. Depending on market conditions, we may enter into futures contracts, forward contracts, commodity swaps and put and call option contracts in order to reduce the impact of commodity price fluctuations. The majority of our commodity derivatives expire within one year.\nThe Epoxy segment consumes some products manufactured by the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment. The Epoxy segment's upstream and midstream products are partially commodity markets. Pricing for these products is subject to a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control. While competitive differentiation exists through downstream customization and product development opportunities, pricing is extremely competitive with a broad range of competitors across the globe.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, net charges to income for environmental investigatory and remedial activities were $20.5 million, which include $4.8 million of an environmental insurance-related settlement gain. For the year ended December 31, 2018, net credits to income for environmental investigatory and remedial activities were $103.7 million, which include $111.0 million of insurance recoveries for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods. Without these recoveries, charges to income for environmental investigatory and remedial activities in 2019 and 2018 would have been $25.3 million and $7.3 million, respectively. The increase in environmental expense from the prior year primarily relates to a $20.0 million increase in costs at a former manufacturing site resulting from revised remediation estimates as a result of agency action. These charges related primarily to expected future investigatory and remedial activities associated with past manufacturing operations and former waste disposal sites.", "item_7_tables": "Table 24:

working capital management. Olin reduced working capital by $142 million in 2020. \n\n- Capital expenditures were $298.9 million in 2020, down from $385.6 million in 2019. Capital spending is expected to be around $200 million in 2021.\n\n- Net loss was $969.9 million in 2020 compared to $11.3 million in 2019, primarily due to a $699.8 million goodwill impairment charge and lower results in the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment from lower pricing and volumes. \n\n- Sales decreased 6% in 2020 compared to 2019, with lower sales in Chlor Alkali and Epoxy partially offset by higher sales in Winchester.\n\n- Chlor Alkali segment results decreased significantly in 2020 due to lower caustic soda and EDC pricing and volumes. Epoxy results declined due to lower pricing. Winchester results improved due to higher volumes and pricing. \n\n- Selling and admin expenses were flat at 7% of sales in both 2020 and 2019. Restructuring charges were incurred related to plant closures.\n\n- A goodwill impairment charge of $699.8 million was recorded in 2020 related to Chlor Alkali and Epoxy segments. \n\n- Debt increased in 2020 due to new bond issuances and borrowings, while equity declined primarily due to the goodwill impairment. The debt-to-capital ratio increased to 72.7% at the end of 2020 from 58.0% at the end of 2019.\n\n- Environmental charges were $20.9 million in 2020 compared to $20.5 million in 2019. Total environmental liabilities were $147.2 million at the end of 2020.\n\n- The effective tax rate was 21.0% in 2020 compared to 16.8% in 2019. The cash tax rate is expected to be 15-20% in 2021."}
