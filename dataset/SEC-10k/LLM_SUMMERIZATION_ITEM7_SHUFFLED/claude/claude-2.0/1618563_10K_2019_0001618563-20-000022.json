Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" as well as Item 1. \"Business,\" Item 1A. \"Risk Factors,\" and Item 2. \"Properties,\" respectively, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nNational Storage Affiliates Trust is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust organized in the state of Maryland on May 16, 2013. We have elected and we believe that we have qualified to be taxed as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2015. We serve as the sole general partner of our operating partnership, a Delaware limited partnership formed on February 13, 2013 to conduct our business, which is focused on the ownership, operation, and acquisition of self storage properties located within the top 100 MSAs throughout the United States.\nOur Structure\nOur structure promotes operator accountability as subordinated performance units issued to our PROs in exchange for the contribution of their properties are entitled to distributions only after those properties satisfy minimum performance thresholds. In the event of a material reduction in operating cash flow, distributions on our subordinated performance units will be reduced before or disproportionately to distributions on our common shares held by our common shareholders. In addition, we expect our PROs will generally co-invest subordinated equity in the form of subordinated performance units in each acquisition that they source, and the value of these subordinated performance units will fluctuate with the performance of their managed portfolios. Therefore, our PROs are incentivized to select acquisitions that are expected to exceed minimum performance thresholds, thereby increasing the value of their subordinated equity stake. We expect that our shareholders will benefit from the higher levels of property performance that our PROs are incentivized to deliver.\nOur PROs\nWe had ten PROs as of December 31, 2019: SecurCare, Northwest, Optivest, Guardian, Move It, Storage Solutions, Hide Away, Personal Mini, Southern and Moove In. We seek to further expand our platform by continuing to recruit additional established self storage operators, while integrating our operations through the implementation of centralized initiatives, including management information systems, revenue enhancement, and cost optimization programs. Our national platform allows us to capture cost savings by eliminating redundancies and utilizing economies of scale across the property management platforms of our PROs while also providing greater access to lower-cost capital.\nOur Consolidated Properties\nWe seek to own properties that are well located in high quality sub-markets with highly accessible street access and attractive supply and demand characteristics, providing our properties with strong and stable cash flows that are less sensitive to the fluctuations of the general economy. Many of these markets have multiple barriers to entry against increased supply, including zoning restrictions against new construction and new construction costs that we believe are higher than our properties' fair market value.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we owned a geographically diversified portfolio of 567 self storage properties, located in 29 states and Puerto Rico, comprising approximately 34.5 million rentable square feet, configured in approximately 275,000 storage units. Of these properties, 265 were acquired by us from our PROs, 301 were acquired by us from third-party sellers and one was acquired by us from the 2016 Joint Venture.\nOur Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures\nWe seek to opportunistically partner with institutional funds and other institutional investors to acquire attractive portfolios utilizing a promoted return structure. We believe there is significant opportunity for continued external growth by partnering with institutional investors seeking to deploy capital in the self storage industry.\n2018 Joint Venture\nAs of December 31, 2019, our 2018 Joint Venture, in which we have a 25% interest, owned and operated a portfolio of 103 properties containing approximately 7.7 million rentable square feet, configured in approximately 63,000 storage units and located across 17 states.\n2016 Joint Venture\nAs of December 31, 2019, our 2016 Joint Venture, in which we have a 25% ownership interest, owned and operated a portfolio of 72 properties containing approximately 4.9 million rentable square feet, configured in approximately 40,000 storage units and located across 13 states.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, our 2016 Joint Venture sold to the Company one self storage property for $4.1 million, comprising less than 0.1 million rentable square feet, configured in approximately 300 storage units.\nOur Property Management Platform\nThrough our property management platform, branded iStorage, we direct, manage and control the day-to-day operations and affairs of certain consolidated properties and our unconsolidated real estate ventures. We earn certain customary fees for managing and operating the properties in the unconsolidated real estate ventures and we facilitate tenant insurance and/or tenant warranty protection programs for tenants at these properties in exchange for half of all proceeds from such programs.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our property management platform managed and controlled 42 of our consolidated properties in select markets in California, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, Missouri, Ohio, Texas and Virginia.\nResults of Operations\nWhen reviewing our results of operations it is important to consider the timing of acquisition activity. We acquired 69 self storage properties during the year ended December 31, 2019 and 57 self storage properties during the year ended December 31, 2018. As a result of these and other factors, we do not believe that our historical results of operations discussed and analyzed below are comparable or necessarily indicative of our future results of operations or cash flows.\nTo help analyze the operating performance of our self storage properties, we also discuss and analyze operating results relating to our same store portfolio. Our same store portfolio is defined as those properties owned and operated since the first day of the earliest year presented, excluding any properties sold, expected to be sold or subject to significant changes such as expansions or casualty events which cause the portfolio's year-over-year operating results to no longer be comparable.\nThe following discussion and analysis of the results of our operations and financial condition for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. The discussion and analysis of the results of our operations and financial condition for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, can be found in Part II, \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was filed with the SEC on February 26, 2019.\nCertain figures, such as interest rates and other percentages, included in this section have been rounded for ease of presentation. Percentage figures included in this section have not in all cases been calculated on the basis of such rounded figures but on the basis of such amounts prior to rounding. For this reason, percentage amounts in this section may vary slightly from those obtained by performing the same calculations using the figures in our consolidated financial statements or in the associated text. Certain other amounts that appear in this section may similarly not sum due to rounding.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nNet income was $66.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $56.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $9.7 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net operating income (\"NOI\") resulting from self storage properties acquired during 2018 and 2019, increases in management fees and other revenue, partially offset by increases in depreciation and amortization, interest expense and general and administrative expenses. For a description of NOI, see \"Non-GAAP Financial measures - NOI\".\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2019, our same store portfolio consisted of 439 self storage properties. See \"---Results of Operations\" above for the definition of our same store portfolio. The following table illustrates the changes in rental revenue, other property-related revenue, management fees and other revenue, property operating expenses, and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

total revenue increased by $57.0 million, or 17.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily attributable to incremental revenue from 69 self storage properties acquired during the year ended December 31, 2019, increases in management fees and other revenue from our unconsolidated real estate ventures and regular rental increases for in-place tenants.\nRental Revenue\nRental revenue increased by $46.5 million, or 15.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, we adopted ASU 2016-02 and ASU 2018-11 effective January 1, 2019. As a result of this adoption, beginning on January 1, 2019, activity related to uncollectible accounts is recognized as a current-period adjustment within revenue. For periods prior to January 1, 2019, such amounts were previously included in operating expenses, and as such, for comparability, we have presented $8.6 million of activity related to uncollectible accounts as a reduction to same store and non-same store rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in rental revenue was due to a $44.2 million increase in non-same store rental revenue which was primarily attributable to incremental rental revenue of $29.6 million from 69 self storage properties acquired during 2019, and $15.4 million from 57 self storage properties acquired during 2018. Same store portfolio rental revenues increased $10.8 million, or 3.9%, due to a 3.5% increase, from $11.58 to $11.98, in annualized same store rental revenue (including fees and net of any discounts and uncollectible customer amounts) divided by average occupied square feet (\"average annualized rental revenue per occupied square foot\"), driven primarily by increased contractual lease rates for in-place tenants and fees and an increase in average occupancy from 88.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 88.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Average occupancy is calculated based on the average of the month-end occupancy immediately preceding the period presented and the month-end occupancies included in the respective period presented.\nOther Property-Related Revenue\nOther property-related revenue represents ancillary income from our self storage properties, such as tenant insurance-related access fees and sales of storage supplies. Other property-related revenue increased by $2.1 million, or 20.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase primarily resulted from a $1.6 million increase in non-same store other property-related revenue which was primarily attributable to incremental other property-related revenue of $0.8 million from 69 self storage properties acquired during 2019, and $0.8 million from 57 self storage properties acquired during 2018.\nManagement Fees and Other Revenue\nManagement fees and other revenue, which are primarily related to managing and operating the unconsolidated real estate ventures, were $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $8.4 million or 68.4%. This increase was primarily attributable to incremental fees earned from the 2018 Joint Venture following the acquisition of the Initial 2018 JV Portfolio (as defined in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8) in September 2018.\nProperty Operating Expenses\nProperty operating expenses were $110.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $103.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $6.4 million, or 6.2%. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, we adopted ASU 2016-02 and ASU 2018-11 effective January 1, 2019. As a result of this adoption, beginning on January 1, 2019, activity related to uncollectible accounts is recognized as a current-period adjustment within revenue. For periods prior to January 1, 2019, such amounts were previously\nincluded in operating expenses, and as such, for comparability, we have presented $8.6 million of activity related to uncollectible accounts as a reduction to same store and non-same store property operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in property operating expenses resulted from a $13.6 million increase in non-same store property operating expenses that was primarily attributable to incremental property operating expenses of $9.3 million from 69 self storage properties acquired during 2019, and $4.6 million from 57 self storage properties acquired during 2018.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $9.4 million, or 25.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was attributable to increases in supervisory and administrative fees charged by our PROs of $3.1 million primarily as a result of incremental fees related to the 69 self storage properties acquired during 2019, costs related to our property management platform of $2.3 million, salaries and benefits of $2.2 million, equity-based compensation expense of $0.7 million and $1.1 million of other general and administrative expenses.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization increased $16.0 million, or 17.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily attributable to incremental depreciation expense related to the 69 self storage properties acquired during 2019, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of customer in-place leases from $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $13.7 million, or 32.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to additional borrowings consisting of $155.0 million of additional term loan borrowings under the Company's credit facility on July 29, 2019 and $100.0 million of borrowings under the 2029 Term Loan Facility. Additionally, on August 30, 2019, our operating partnership issued the $150.0 million Senior Unsecured Notes in a private placement to certain accredited investors. The increase in interest expense from these additional borrowings was partially offset by lower outstanding borrowings under the Revolver.\nEquity In Losses Of Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures\nEquity in losses of unconsolidated real estate ventures represents our share of losses incurred through our 25% ownership interests in the 2018 Joint Venture and the 2016 Joint Venture. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded $5.0 million of equity in losses from our unconsolidated real estate ventures compared to $1.4 million of losses for the year ended December 31, 2018. This was primarily the result of incremental losses from our 2018 Joint Venture driven by real estate depreciation and amortization of customer in-place leases following the acquisition of the Initial 2018 JV Portfolio in September 2018.\nGain On Sale of Self Storage Properties\nGain on sale of self storage properties was $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold one self storage property to an unrelated third party for gross proceeds of $6.5 million and during the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold two self storage properties to unrelated third parties for gross proceeds of $5.5 million.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, we allocate U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") income (loss) utilizing the HLBV method, in which we allocate income or loss based on the change in each unitholders' claim on the net assets of our operating partnership at period end after adjusting for any distributions or contributions made during such period.\nDue to the stated liquidation priorities and because the HLBV method incorporates non-cash items such as depreciation expense, in any given period, income or loss may be allocated disproportionately to noncontrolling interests. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $62.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $42.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those that impact our most critical accounting policies. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following are our most critical accounting policies.\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Presentation of Noncontrolling Interests\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our operating partnership and its controlled subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidation of entities.\nThe limited partner ownership interests in our operating partnership that are held by owners other than us are referred to as noncontrolling interests. Noncontrolling interests also include ownership interests in DownREIT partnerships held by entities other than our operating partnership. Noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary are generally reported as a separate component of equity in our consolidated balance sheets. In our statements of operations, the revenues, expenses and net income or loss related to noncontrolling interests in our operating partnership are included in the consolidated amounts, with net income or loss attributable to the noncontrolling interests deducted separately to arrive at the net income or loss solely attributable to us.\nWhen we obtain an economic interest in an entity, we evaluate the entity to determine if the entity is deemed a variable interest entity (\"VIE\"), and if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary, in accordance with authoritative guidance issued on the consolidation of VIEs. When an entity is not deemed to be a VIE, we consider the provisions of additional guidance to determine whether the general partner controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights. We consolidate all entities that are VIEs and of which the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary.\nSelf Storage Properties and Customer In-Place Leases\nSelf storage properties are carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. When self storage properties are acquired, the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values. The purchase price is allocated to the individual properties based on the fair value determined using an income approach or a cash flow analysis using appropriate risk adjusted capitalization rates, which take into account the relative size, age, and location of the individual properties along with current and projected occupancy and relative rental rates or appraised values, if available. Tangible assets are allocated to land, buildings and related improvements, and furniture and equipment.\nIn allocating the purchase price for a self storage property acquisition, we determine whether the acquisition includes intangible assets. We allocate a portion of the purchase price to an intangible asset attributed to the value of customer in-place leases. Because the majority of tenant leases are on a month-to-month basis, this intangible asset represents the estimated value of the leases in effect on the acquisition date. This intangible asset is amortized to expense using the straight-line method over 12 months, the estimated average remaining rental period for the leases.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nFFO and Core FFO\nFunds from operations, or FFO, is a widely used performance measure for real estate companies and is provided here as a supplemental measure of the Company's operating performance. The December 2018 Nareit Funds From Operations White Paper - 2018 Restatement, which we refer to as the White Paper, defines FFO as net income (as determined under GAAP), excluding: real estate depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, mark-to-market changes in value recognized on equity securities, impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and impairment of investments in entities when it is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity and after items to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis. Distributions declared on subordinated performance units and DownREIT subordinated performance units represent our allocation of FFO to noncontrolling interests held by subordinated performance unitholders and DownREIT subordinated performance unitholders. For purposes of calculating FFO attributable to common shareholders, OP unitholders, and LTIP unitholders, we exclude distributions declared on subordinated performance units, DownREIT subordinated performance units, preferred shares and preferred units. We define Core FFO as FFO, as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance. These further adjustments consist of acquisition costs, organizational and offering costs, gains on debt forgiveness, gains (losses) on early extinguishment of debt, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nManagement uses FFO and Core FFO as key performance indicators in evaluating the operations of our properties. Given the nature of our business as a real estate owner and operator, we consider FFO and Core FFO as key supplemental measures of our operating performance that are not specifically defined by GAAP. We believe that FFO and Core FFO are useful to management and investors as a starting point in measuring our operational performance because FFO and Core FFO exclude various items included in net income (loss) that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating performance such as gains (or losses) from sales of self storage properties and depreciation, which can make periodic and peer analyses of operating performance more difficult. Our computation of FFO and Core FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies.\nFFO and Core FFO should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP, such as total revenues, operating income and net income (loss). FFO and Core FFO do not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and are not a measure of liquidity or an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO and Core FFO should be compared with our reported net income (loss) and considered in addition to cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) to FFO and Core FFO for the periods presented (in thousands, except per share and unit amounts):\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56,326 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,998 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add (subtract): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate depreciation and amortization </td> <td>103,835 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87,938 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73,669 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Company's share of unconsolidated real estate venture real estate depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>19,889 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,233 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,296 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of self storage properties </td> <td>(2,814) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(391) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,715) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mark-to-market changes in value on equity securities\n</td> <td>(610) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Company's share of unconsolidated real estate venture loss on sale of properties\n</td> <td>202 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>205 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions to preferred shareholders and unitholders\n</td> <td>(13,243) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,822) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,300) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO attributable to subordinated performance unitholders(1)\n</td> <td>(34,121) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27,111) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(28,364) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO attributable to common shareholders, OP unitholders, and LTIP unitholders\n</td> <td>139,151 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>116,378 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,584 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition costs </td> <td>1,317 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>663 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>593 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Company's share of unconsolidated real estate venture acquisition costs\n</td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core FFO attributable to common shareholders, OP unitholders, and LTIP unitholders\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>140,468 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>117,041 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>91,199 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average shares and units outstanding -

The computation of weighted average shares and units for FFO and Core FFO per share and unit includes all restricted common shares and LTIP units that participate in distributions and excludes all subordinated performance units and DownREIT subordinated performance units because their effect has been accounted for through the allocation of FFO to the related unitholders based on distributions declared.\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2) Represents the effect of adjusting the numerator to consolidated net income (loss) prior to GAAP allocations for noncontrolling interests, after deducting preferred share and unit distributions, and before the application of the two-class method and treasury stock method, as described in footnote (1).\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNOI\nWe define NOI as net income (loss), as determined under GAAP, plus general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, loss on early extinguishment of debt, equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated real estate ventures, acquisition costs, organizational and offering expenses, income tax expense, impairment of long-lived assets, losses on the sale of properties and non-operating expense and by subtracting management fees and other revenue, gains on sale of properties, debt forgiveness, and non-operating income. NOI is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nWe believe NOI is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because:\n\u2022NOI is one of the primary measures used by our management and our PROs to evaluate the economic productivity of our properties, including our ability to lease our properties, increase pricing and occupancy and control our property operating expenses;\n\u2022NOI is widely used in the real estate industry and the self storage industry to measure the performance and value of real estate assets without regard to various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, such as depreciation and amortization, which can vary depending upon accounting methods, the book value of assets, and the impact of our capital structure; and\n\u2022We believe NOI helps our investors to meaningfully compare the results of our operating performance from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense on our outstanding indebtedness) and depreciation of the cost basis of our assets from our operating results.\nThere are material limitations to using a non-GAAP measure such as NOI, including the difficulty associated with comparing results among more than one company and the inability to analyze certain significant items, including depreciation and interest expense, that directly affect our net income (loss). We compensate for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with our analysis of net income (loss). NOI should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP, such as total revenues, income from operations and net loss.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) to NOI for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56,326 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,998 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Subtract) add: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management fees and other revenue </td> <td>(20,735) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,310) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,061) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses </td> <td>45,581 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,220 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,060 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>105,119 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89,147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75,115 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td>56,464 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,724 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,068 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in losses of unconsolidated real estate venture\n</td> <td>4,970 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,423 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,339 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition costs </td> <td>1,317 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>663 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>593 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense </td> <td>1,351 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>818 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,159 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of self storage properties </td> <td>(2,814) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(391) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,715) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-operating (income) expense </td> <td>(452) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net operating income\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>256,814 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>214,711 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>175,614 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur consolidated NOI shown in the table above does not include our proportionate share of NOI for our unconsolidated real estate ventures. For additional information about our 2018 Joint Venture and 2016 Joint Venture see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nWe define EBITDA as net income (loss), as determined under GAAP, plus interest expense, loss on early extinguishment of debt, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense and the Company's share of unconsolidated real estate venture depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus acquisition costs, organizational and offering expenses, equity-based compensation expense, losses on sale of properties and impairment of long-lived assets, minus gains on sale of properties and debt forgiveness, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. These further adjustments eliminate the impact of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance. In evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nWe present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because we believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as an analytical tool. Some of these limitations are:\n\u2022EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures, contractual commitments or working capital needs;\n\u2022EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debts;\n\u2022although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA excludes equity-based compensation expense, which is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term incentive compensation package, although we exclude it as an expense when evaluating our ongoing operating performance for a particular period;\n\u2022EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and\n\u2022other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\nWe compensate for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with our analysis of net income (loss). EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP, such as total revenues, income from operations, and net income (loss).\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56,326 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,998 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>105,119 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89,147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75,115 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Company's share of unconsolidated real estate venture depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>19,889 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,233 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,296 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense </td> <td>1,351 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>818 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,159 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td>56,464 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,724 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,068 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>248,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>199,248 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>163,636 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition costs </td> <td>1,317 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>663 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>593 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Company's share of unconsolidated real estate venture acquisition costs\n</td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of self storage properties </td> <td>(2,814) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(391) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,715) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Company's share of unconsolidated real estate venture loss on sale of properties\n</td> <td>202 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>205 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity-based compensation expense </td> <td>4,527 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,837 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,764 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>252,068 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>203,562 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>162,300 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity Overview\nLiquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations. Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from our operations. Additional sources are proceeds from equity and debt offerings, and debt financings including borrowings under the credit facility, 2023 Term Loan Facility, 2028 Term Loan Facility and 2029 Term Loan Facility.\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of property operating expenses, property acquisitions, capital expenditures, general and administrative expenses and principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness. A further short-term liquidity requirement relates to distributions to our common and preferred shareholders and holders of preferred units, OP units, subordinated performance units, DownREIT OP units and DownREIT subordinated performance units. We expect to fund short-term liquidity requirements from our operating cash flow, cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facility.\nOur long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of the repayment of debt, property acquisitions, and capital expenditures. We acquire properties through the use of cash, preferred units, OP units and subordinated performance units in our operating partnership or DownREIT partnerships. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity\nrequirements with operating cash flow, cash on hand, secured and unsecured indebtedness, and the issuance of equity and debt securities.\nThe availability of credit and its related effect on the overall economy may affect our liquidity and future financing activities, both through changes in interest rates and access to financing. Currently, interest rates are low compared to historical levels and many lenders are active in the market. We believe that, as a publicly-traded REIT, we will have access to multiple sources of capital to fund our long-term liquidity requirements, including the incurrence of additional debt and the issuance of debt and additional equity securities. However, we cannot assure you that this will be the case.\nCash Flows\nAt December 31, 2019, we had $20.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $3.7 million of restricted cash, an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $7.4 million and an increase in restricted cash of $0.5 million from December 31, 2018. Restricted cash primarily consists of escrowed funds deposited with financial institutions for real estate taxes, insurance, and other reserves for capital improvements in accordance with our loan agreements. The following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating, investing, and financing activities, which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included in Item 8 of this report.\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by our operating activities was $196.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $161.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $34.9 million. Our operating cash flow increased primarily due to 57 self storage properties acquired during the year ended December 31, 2018 that generated cash flow for the entire year ended December 31, 2019 and 69 self storage properties that were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, operating distributions from our unconsolidated real estate ventures increased by $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. These increases were partially offset by higher cash payments for general and administrative expenses and interest expense.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $393.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $514.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The primary uses of cash for the year ended December 31, 2019 were for our acquisition of 69 self storage properties for cash consideration of $371.1 million, the acquisition of equity securities for $12.7 million, deposits for potential acquisitions of $4.4 million, capital expenditures of $20.6 million and the acquisition of the interest in a reinsurance company and related cash flows of $6.6 million, partially offset by distributions from unconsolidated real estate ventures of $11.5 million, $6.3 million of proceeds from the sale of one self storage property and $5.4 million of proceeds from the sale of equity securities. The primary uses of cash for the year ended December 31, 2018 were for our acquisition of 57 self storage properties and an expansion project for cash consideration of $313.7 million, investments in our unconsolidated real estate ventures of $165.6 million, deposits for acquisitions of $21.0 million and capital expenditures of $19.0 million, partially offset by $5.3 million of proceeds from the sale of two self storage properties.\nCapital expenditures totaled $20.6 million, $19.0 million and $14.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 respectively, we generally fund post-acquisition capital additions from cash provided by operating activities.\nWe categorize our capital expenditures broadly into three primary categories:\n\u2022recurring capital expenditures, which represent the portion of capital expenditures that are deemed to replace the consumed portion of acquired capital assets and extend their useful life;\n\u2022value enhancing capital expenditures, which represent the portion of capital expenditures that are made to enhance the revenue and value of an asset from its original purchase condition; and\n\u2022acquisitions capital expenditures, which represent the portion of capital expenditures capitalized during the current period that were identified and underwritten prior to a property's acquisition.\nThe following table presents a summary of the capital expenditures for these categories, along with a reconciliation of the total for these categories to the capital expenditures reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recurring capital expenditures </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,708 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,001 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,495 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Value enhancing capital expenditures </td> <td>4,420 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,563 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,755 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions capital expenditures </td> <td>8,305 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,356 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,953 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital expenditures </td> <td>21,433 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,920 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,203 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in accrued capital spending </td> <td>(839) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>94 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(547) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures per statement of cash flows </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,594 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,656 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by our financing activities was $204.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $352.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

The Revolver matures in January 2024; provided that we may elect to extend the maturity to July 2024 by paying an extension fee of 0.075% of the total borrowing commitment thereunder at the time of extension and meeting other customary conditions with respect to compliance. The Term Loan A matures in January 2023, the Term Loan B matures in July 2024, the Term Loan C matures in January 2025 and the Term Loan D matures in July 2026. The Revolver, Term Loan A, Term Loan B, Term Loan C and Term Loan D are not subject to any scheduled reduction or amortization payments prior to maturity. As of December 31, 2019, we have an expansion option under the credit facility, which, if exercised in full, would provide for a total credit facility of $1.750 billion.\nAs of December 31, 2019, $125.0 million was outstanding under the Term Loan A with an effective interest rate of 3.74%, $250.0 million was outstanding under the Term Loan B with an effective interest rate of 2.91%, $225.0 million was outstanding under the Term Loan C with an effective interest rate of 2.80%, $175.0 million was outstanding under the Term Loan D with an effective interest rate of 3.57%.

As of December 31, 2019 the entire amount was outstanding under the 2028 Term Loan Facility with an effective interest rate of 4.62%. We have an expansion option under the 2028 Term Loan Facility, which, if exercised in full, would provide for total borrowings in an aggregate amount up to $125.0 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we entered into a credit agreement with a lender for the 2029 Term Loan Facility that matures in April 2029 and is separate from the credit facility, 2023 Term Loan Facility and 2028 Term Loan Facility in an aggregate amount of $100.0 million. As of December 31, 2019 the entire amount was outstanding under the 2029 Term Loan Facility with an effective interest rate of 4.27%.\nFor a summary of our financial covenants and additional detail regarding our credit facility, 2023 Term Loan Facility, 2028 Term Loan Facility and 2029 Term Loan Facility, please see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\n2029 And 2031 Senior Unsecured Notes\nAs discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, on August 30, 2019, our operating partnership issued $100.0 million of 3.98% senior unsecured notes due August 30, 2029 and $50.0 million of 4.08% senior unsecured notes due August 30, 2031 in a private placement to certain accredited investors.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding payments due under contractual obligations and commitments on an undiscounted basis as of December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ending December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt financings: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal(1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,647 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,603 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,205 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>377,049 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>271,964 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>837,792 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,539,260 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest(2)\n</td> <td>54,498 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53,571 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53,381 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,468 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,474 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89,512 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>331,904 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate leasehold interests\n</td> <td>1,419 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,459 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,464 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,470 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,728 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,984 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office lease\n</td> <td>286 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>387 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>381 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>346 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>353 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>691 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,444 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>96,850 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>63,005 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59,426 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>423,327 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>310,261 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>964,723 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,917,592 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Includes scheduled principal and maturity payments related to our debt financings.\n(2)Interest is calculated until the maturity date (without regard to any extension that may be elected by the Company) based on the outstanding principal balance and the effective interest rate as of December 31, 2019.\nEquity Transactions\nIssuance of Common Shares and Series A Preferred Shares\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold 2,375,000 of our common shares and 1,785,680 of our Series A Preferred Shares through at the market offerings. The common shares were sold at an average offering price of $30.06 per share, resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $70.6 million after deducting compensation payable by us to such agents and offering expenses. The Series A Preferred Shares were sold at an average offering price of $24.84 per share, resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $43.6 million after deducting compensation payable by us to such agents and offering expenses.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, after receiving notices of redemption from certain OP unitholders, we elected to issue 581,001 common shares to such holders in exchange for 581,001 OP units in satisfaction of the operating partnership's redemption obligations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company issued 37,770 common shares in exchange for $1.3 million of principal payment reimbursements received during the year ended December 31, 2019 related to mortgages assumed in connection with the acquisition of self storage properties from PROs during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nIssuance of OP Equity\nIn connection with the 69 properties acquired during the year ended December 31, 2019, $51.8 million of OP equity was issued (consisting of 350,319 OP units, 340,702 Series A-1 preferred units and 1,178,400 subordinated performance units).\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company issued 863,148 OP units upon conversion of 913,680 subordinated performance units and 13,475 DownREIT OP units upon conversion of 15,377 DownREIT subordinated performance units as further described under \"Subordinated Performance Units and DownREIT Subordinated Performance Units\" in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\nDividends and Distributions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company paid $74.5 million of distributions to common shareholders, $12.4 million of distributions to preferred shareholders and distributed $76.0 million to noncontrolling interests.\nOn February 20, 2020, our board of trustees declared a cash dividend and distribution, respectively, of $0.33 per common share and OP unit to shareholders and OP unitholders of record as of March 13, 2020. On February 20, 2020, our board of trustees also declared cash distributions of $0.375 per Series A Preferred Share and Series A-1 preferred unit to shareholders and unitholders of record as of March 13, 2020. In addition, we expect to declare a cash distribution in the first quarter of 2020 to our subordinated performance unitholders of record as of March 13, 2020. Such dividends and distributions are expected to be paid on March 31, 2020.\nCash Distributions from our Operating Partnership\nUnder the LP Agreement of our operating partnership, to the extent that we, as the general partner of our operating partnership, determine to make distributions to the partners of our operating partnership out of the operating cash flow or capital transaction proceeds generated by a real property portfolio managed by one of our PROs, the holders of the series of subordinated performance units that relate to such portfolio are entitled to share in such distributions. Under the LP Agreement of our operating partnership, operating cash flow with respect to a portfolio of properties managed by one of our PROs is generally an amount determined by us, as general partner of our operating partnership, equal to the excess of property revenues over property related expenses from that portfolio. In general, property revenue from the portfolio includes:\n(i)all receipts, including rents and other operating revenues;\n(ii)any incentive, financing, break-up and other fees paid to us by third parties;\n(iii)amounts released from previously set aside reserves; and\n(iv)any other amounts received by us, which we allocate to the particular portfolio of properties.\nIn general, property-related expenses include all direct expenses related to the operation of the properties in that portfolio, including real property taxes, insurance, property-level general and administrative expenses, employee costs, utilities, property marketing expense, property maintenance and property reserves and other expenses incurred at the property level. In addition, other expenses incurred by our operating partnership will also be allocated by us, as general partner, to the property portfolio and will be included in the property-related expenses of that portfolio. Examples of such other expenses include:\n(i)corporate-level general and administrative expenses;\n(ii)out-of-pocket costs, expenses and fees of our operating partnership, whether or not capitalized;\n(iii)the costs and expenses of organizing and operating our operating partnership;\n(iv)amounts paid or due in respect of any loan or other indebtedness of our operating partnership during such period;\n(v)extraordinary expenses of our operating partnership not previously or otherwise deducted under item (ii) above;\n(vi)any third-party costs and expenses associated with identifying, analyzing, and presenting a proposed property to us and/or our operating partnership; and\n(vii)reserves to meet anticipated operating expenditures, debt service or other liabilities, as determined by us.\nTo the extent that we, as the general partner of our operating partnership, determine to make distributions to the partners of our operating partnership out of the operating cash flow of a real property portfolio managed by one of our PROs, operating cash flow from a property portfolio is required to be allocated to OP unitholders and to the holders of series of subordinated performance units that relate to such property portfolio as follows:\nFirst, an amount is allocated to OP unitholders in order to provide OP unitholders (together with any prior allocations of capital transaction proceeds) with a cumulative preferred allocation on the unreturned capital contributions attributed to the OP units in respect of such property portfolio. The preferred allocation for all of our existing portfolios is 6%. As of December 31, 2019, our operating partnership had an aggregate of $1,632.2 million of unreturned capital contributions with respect to common shareholders and OP unitholders, with respect to the various property portfolios.\nSecond, an amount is allocated to the holders of the series of subordinated performance units relating to such property portfolio in order to provide such holders with an allocation (together with prior distributions of capital transaction proceeds) on their unreturned capital contributions. Although the subordinated allocation for the subordinated performance units is non-cumulative from period to period, if the operating cash flow from a property portfolio related to a series of subordinated performance units is sufficient, in the judgment of the general partner (with the approval of a majority of our independent trustees), to fund distributions to the holders of such series of subordinated performance units, but we, as the general partner of our operating partnership, decline to make distributions to such holders, the amount available but not paid as distributions will be added to the subordinated allocation corresponding to such series of subordinated performance units. The subordinated allocation for the outstanding subordinated performance units is 6%. As of December 31, 2019, an aggregate of $152.8 million of unreturned capital contributions has been allocated to the various series of subordinated performance units.\nThereafter, any additional operating cash flow is allocated to OP unitholders and the applicable series of subordinated performance units equally.\nFollowing the allocation described above, we as the general partner of our operating partnership, will generally cause our operating partnership to distribute the amounts allocated to the relevant series of subordinated performance units to the holders of such series of subordinated performance units. We, as the general partner, may cause our operating partnership to distribute the amounts allocated to OP unitholders or may cause our operating partnership to retain such amounts to be used by our operating partnership for any purpose. Any operating cash flow that is attributable to amounts retained by our operating partnership pursuant to the preceding sentence will generally be available to be allocated as an additional capital contribution to the various property portfolios.\nThe foregoing description of the allocation of operating cash flow between the OP unitholders and subordinated performance unitholders is used for purposes of determining distributions to holders of subordinated performance units but does not necessarily represent the operating cash flow that will be distributed to OP unitholders (or paid as dividends to holders of our common shares). Any distribution of operating cash flow allocated to the OP unitholders will be made at our discretion (and paid as dividends to holders of our common shares at the discretion of our board of trustees).\nUnder the LP Agreement of our operating partnership, capital transactions are transactions that are outside the ordinary course of our operating partnership's business, involve the sale, exchange, other disposition, or refinancing of any property, and are designated as capital transactions by us, as the general partner. To the extent the general partner determines to distribute capital transaction proceeds, the proceeds from capital transactions involving a particular property portfolio are required to be allocated to OP unitholders and to the series of subordinated performance units that relate to such property portfolio as follows:\nFirst, an amount determined by us, as the general partner, of such capital transaction proceeds is allocated to OP unitholders in order to provide OP unitholders (together with any prior allocations of operating cash flow) with a cumulative preferred allocation on the unreturned capital contributions attributed to the OP unitholders in respect of\nsuch property portfolio that relate to such capital transaction plus an additional amount equal to such unreturned capital contributions.\nSecond, an amount determined by us, as the general partner, is allocated to the holders of the series of subordinated performance units relating to such property portfolio in order to provide such holders with a non-cumulative subordinated allocation on the unreturned capital contributions made by such holders in respect of such property portfolio that relate to such capital transaction plus an additional amount equal to such unreturned capital contributions.\nThe preferred allocation and subordinated allocation with respect to capital transaction proceeds for each portfolio is equal to the preferred allocation and subordinated allocation for distributions of operating cash flow with respect to that portfolio.\nThereafter, any additional capital transaction proceeds are allocated to OP unitholders and the applicable series of subordinated performance units equally.\nFollowing the allocation described above, we, as the general partner of our operating partnership, will generally cause our operating partnership to distribute the amounts allocated to the relevant series of subordinated performance units to the holders of such series of subordinated performance units. We, as general partner of our operating partnership, may cause our operating partnership to distribute the amounts allocated to the OP unitholders or may cause our operating partnership to retain such amounts to be used by our operating partnership for any purpose. Any capital transaction proceeds that are attributable to amounts retained by our operating partnership pursuant to the preceding sentence will generally be available to be allocated as an additional capital contribution to the various property portfolios.\nThe foregoing allocation of capital transaction proceeds between the OP unitholders and subordinated performance unitholders is used for purposes of determining distributions to holders of subordinated performance units but does not necessarily represent the capital transaction proceeds that will be distributed to OP unitholders (or paid as dividends to holders of our common shares). Any distribution of capital transaction proceeds allocated to the OP unitholders will be made at our discretion (and paid as dividends to holders of our common shares at the discretion of our board of trustees).\nOur OP units are redeemable for cash or, at our option exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into common shares after an agreed period of time and certain other conditions. Our subordinated performance units are only convertible into OP units following a two year lock-out period and then (i) at the holder's election only upon the achievement of certain performance thresholds relating to the properties to which such subordinated performance units relate or (ii) at our election upon a retirement event of a PRO that holds such subordinated performance units or upon certain qualifying terminations.\nNotwithstanding the two-year lock out period on conversions of subordinated performance units into OP units, if such subordinated performance units were convertible into OP units as of December 31, 2019, each subordinated performance unit would on average hypothetically convert into 1.48 OP units, or into an aggregate of approximately 22.8 million OP units. These amounts are based on historical financial information for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The hypothetical conversion is calculated by dividing the average cash available for distribution, or CAD, per subordinated performance unit by 110% of the CAD per OP unit over the same period. We anticipate that as our CAD grows over time, the conversion ratio will also grow, including to levels that may exceed this amount. The actual number of OP units into which such subordinated performance units will become convertible may vary significantly and will depend upon the applicable conversion penalty and the actual CAD to the OP units and the actual CAD to the converted subordinated performance units in the one-year period ending prior to conversion. We have also granted registration rights to those persons who will be eligible to receive common shares issuable upon exchange of OP units issued in our formation transactions and certain contribution transactions.\nAllocation of Capital Contributions\nWe, as the general partner of our operating partnership, in our discretion, have the right to increase or decrease, as appropriate, the amount of capital contributions allocated to our operating partnership in general and to each series of subordinated performance units to reflect capital expenditures made by our operating partnership in respect of each portfolio, the sale or refinancing of all or a portion of the properties comprising the portfolio, the distribution of capital transaction proceeds by our operating partnership, the retention by our operating partnership of cash for working capital purposes and other events impacting the amount of capital contributions allocated to the holders. In addition, to avoid conflicts of interests, any decision by us to increase or decrease allocations of capital contributions must also be approved by a majority of our independent trustees.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nExcept as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements, as of December 31, 2019, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities, which typically are established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements, as of December 31, 2019, we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor made any commitments to provide funding to any such entities that creates any material exposure to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk.\nSegment\nWe manage our business as one reportable segment consisting of investments in self storage properties located in the United States. Although we operate in several markets, these operations have been aggregated into one reportable segment based on the similar economic characteristics among all markets.\nSeasonality\nThe self storage business is subject to minor seasonal fluctuations. A greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from May through September. Historically, our highest level of occupancy has typically been in July, while our lowest level of occupancy has typically been in February. Results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.\nInflation\nInflation in the United States has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Although the impact of inflation has been relatively insignificant in recent years, it remains a factor in the U.S. economy and may increase the cost of acquiring or replacing self storage properties and related improvements, as well as real estate property taxes, employee salaries, wages and benefits, utilities, and other expenses. Because our tenant leases are month-to-month, we may be able to rapidly adjust our rental rates to minimize the adverse impact of any inflation which could mitigate our exposure to increases in costs and expenses resulting from inflation.", "item_7_truncated": "During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company issued 37,770 common shares in exchange for $1.3 million of principal payment

represents our share of losses incurred through our 25% ownership interests in the 2018 Joint Venture and the 2016 Joint Venture. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded $5.0 million of equity in losses from our unconsolidated real estate ventures compared to $1.4 million of losses for the year ended December 31, 2018. This was primarily the result of incremental losses from our 2018 Joint Venture driven by real estate depreciation and amortization of customer in-place leases following the acquisition of the Initial 2018 JV Portfolio in September 2018.\nIn allocating the purchase price for a self storage property acquisition, we determine whether the acquisition includes intangible assets. We allocate a portion of the purchase price to an intangible asset attributed to the value of customer in-place leases. Because the majority of tenant leases are on a month-to-month basis, this intangible asset represents the estimated value of the leases in effect on the acquisition date. This intangible asset is amortized to expense using the straight-line method over 12 months, the estimated average remaining rental period for the leases.\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings (loss) per share - diluted </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.15) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.07 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.01 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of the difference in weighted average number of shares(1)\n</td> <td>0.05 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.03) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of GAAP accounting for noncontrolling interests, two-class method and treasury stock method(2)\n</td> <td>0.69 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.49 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.59 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add real estate depreciation and amortization </td> <td>1.14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.04 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.00 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add Company's share unconsolidated venture real estate depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>0.22 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtract gain on sale of self storage properties\n</td> <td>(0.03) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.08) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mark-to-market changes in value recognized on equity securities\n</td> <td>(0.01) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO attributable to subordinated performance unitholders\n</td> <td>(0.38) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.32) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.39) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO per share and unit\n</td> <td>1.53 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.37 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.23 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add acquisition costs and Company's share of unconsolidated real estate venture acquisition costs\n</td> <td>0.01 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.01 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.01 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core FFO per share and unit\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.38 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.24 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Adjustment accounts for the difference between the weighted average number of shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share and the weighted average number of shares used to calculate FFO and Core FFO per share and unit.

For additional information about the conversion of subordinated performance units, DownREIT subordinated performance units and LTIP units into OP units, see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. The computation of weighted average shares and units for FFO and Core FFO per share and unit includes all restricted common shares and LTIP units that participate in distributions and excludes all subordinated performance units and DownREIT subordinated performance units because their effect has been accounted for through the allocation of FFO to the related unitholders based on distributions declared.\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2) Represents the effect of adjusting the numerator to consolidated net income (loss) prior to GAAP allocations for noncontrolling interests, after deducting preferred share and unit distributions, and before the application of the two-class method and treasury stock method, as described in footnote (1).\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFFO and Core FFO should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP, such as total revenues, operating income and net income (loss).

capital transactions are transactions that are outside the ordinary course of our operating partnership's business, involve the sale, exchange, other disposition, or refinancing of any property, and are designated as capital transactions by us, as the general partner. To the extent the general partner determines to distribute capital transaction proceeds, the proceeds from capital transactions involving a particular property portfolio are required to be allocated to OP unitholders and to the series of subordinated performance units that relate to such property portfolio as follows:\nExcept as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements, as of December 31, 2019, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities, which typically are established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements, as of December 31, 2019, we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor made any commitments to provide funding to any such entities that creates any material exposure to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nRental revenue increased by $46.5 million, or 15.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, we adopted ASU 2016-02 and ASU 2018-11 effective January 1, 2019. As a result of this adoption, beginning on January 1, 2019, activity related to uncollectible accounts is recognized as a current-period adjustment within revenue. For periods prior to January 1, 2019, such amounts were previously included in operating expenses, and as such, for comparability, we have presented $8.6 million of activity related to uncollectible accounts as a reduction to same store and non-same store rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in rental revenue was due to a $44.2 million increase in non-same store rental revenue which was primarily attributable to incremental rental revenue of $29.6 million from 69 self storage properties acquired during 2019, and $15.4 million from 57 self storage properties acquired during 2018. Same store portfolio rental revenues increased $10.8 million, or 3.9%, due to a 3.5% increase, from $11.58 to $11.98, in annualized same store rental revenue (including fees and net of any discounts and uncollectible customer amounts) divided by average occupied square feet (\"average annualized rental revenue per occupied square foot\"), driven primarily by increased contractual lease rates for in-place tenants and fees and an increase in average occupancy from 88.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 88.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Average occupancy is calculated based on the average of the month-end occupancy immediately preceding the period presented and the month-end occupancies included in the respective period presented.\nNOI\nUnder the LP Agreement of our operating partnership, to the extent that we, as the general partner of our operating partnership, determine to make distributions to the partners of our operating partnership out of the operating cash flow or capital transaction proceeds generated by a real property portfolio managed by one of our PROs, the holders of the series of subordinated performance units that relate to such portfolio are entitled to share in such distributions. Under the LP Agreement of our operating partnership, operating cash flow with respect to a portfolio of properties managed by one of our PROs is generally an amount determined by us, as general partner of our operating partnership, equal to the excess of property revenues over property related expenses from that portfolio. In general, property revenue from the portfolio includes:\nInvesting Activities\nTotal Revenue\n(2)Interest is calculated until the maturity date (without regard to any extension that may be elected by the Company) based on the outstanding principal balance and the effective interest rate as of December 31, 2019.\nCertain figures, such as interest rates and other percentages, included in this section have been rounded for ease of presentation. Percentage figures included in this section have not in all cases been calculated on the basis of such rounded figures but on the basis of such amounts prior to rounding. For this reason, percentage amounts in this section may vary slightly from those obtained by performing the same calculations using the figures in our consolidated financial statements or in the associated text. Certain other amounts that appear in this section may similarly not sum due to rounding.\nThe foregoing allocation of capital transaction proceeds between the OP unitholders and subordinated performance unitholders is used for purposes of determining distributions to holders of subordinated performance units but does not necessarily represent the capital transaction proceeds that will be distributed to OP unitholders (or paid as dividends to holders of our common shares). Any distribution of capital transaction proceeds allocated to the OP unitholders will be made at our discretion (and paid as dividends to holders of our common shares at the discretion of our board of trustees).\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, we allocate U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") income (loss) utilizing the HLBV method, in which we allocate income or loss based on the change in each unitholders' claim on the net assets of our operating partnership at period end after adjusting for any distributions or contributions made during such period.\nWe manage our business as one reportable segment consisting of investments in self storage properties located in the United States. Although we operate in several markets, these operations have been aggregated into one reportable segment based on the similar economic characteristics among all markets.\nIssuance of Common Shares and Series A Preferred Shares\nThereafter, any additional capital transaction proceeds are allocated to OP unitholders and the applicable series of subordinated performance units equally.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we owned a geographically diversified portfolio of 567 self storage properties, located in 29 states and Puerto Rico, comprising approximately 34.5 million rentable square feet, configured in approximately 275,000 storage units. Of these properties, 265 were acquired by us from our PROs, 301 were acquired by us from third-party sellers and one was acquired by us from the 2016 Joint Venture.\nThereafter, any additional operating cash flow is allocated to OP unitholders and the applicable series of subordinated performance units equally.\nThe foregoing description of the allocation of operating cash flow between the OP unitholders and subordinated performance unitholders is used for purposes of determining distributions to holders of subordinated performance units but does not necessarily represent the operating cash flow that will be distributed to OP unitholders (or paid as dividends to holders of our common shares). Any distribution of operating cash flow allocated to the OP unitholders will be made at our discretion (and paid as dividends to holders of our common shares at the discretion of our board of trustees).\nOur OP units are redeemable for cash or, at our option exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into common shares after an agreed period of time and certain other conditions. Our subordinated performance units are only convertible into OP units following a two year lock-out period and then (i) at the holder's election only upon the achievement of certain performance thresholds relating to the properties to which such subordinated performance units relate or (ii) at our election upon a retirement event of a PRO that holds such subordinated performance units or upon certain qualifying terminations.\nOther property-related revenue represents ancillary income from our self storage properties, such as tenant insurance-related access fees and sales of storage supplies. Other property-related revenue increased by $2.1 million, or 20.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase primarily resulted from a $1.6 million increase in non-same store other property-related revenue which was primarily attributable to incremental other property-related revenue of $0.8 million from 69 self storage properties acquired during 2019, and $0.8 million from 57 self storage properties acquired during 2018.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company paid $74.5 million of distributions to common shareholders, $12.4 million of distributions to preferred shareholders and distributed $76.0 million to noncontrolling interests.\nAs discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, on August 30, 2019, our operating partnership issued $100.0 million of 3.98% senior unsecured notes due August 30, 2029 and $50.0 million of 4.08% senior unsecured notes due August 30, 2031 in a private placement to certain accredited investors.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of earnings (loss) per share - diluted to FFO and Core FFO per share and unit for the periods presented:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, our 2016 Joint Venture sold to the Company one self storage property for $4.1 million, comprising less than 0.1 million rentable square feet, configured in approximately 300 storage units.\n\nIssuance of OP Equity\nManagement Fees and Other Revenue\nIn general, property-related expenses include all direct expenses related to the operation of the properties in that portfolio, including real property taxes, insurance, property-level general and administrative expenses, employee costs, utilities, property marketing expense, property maintenance and property reserves and other expenses incurred at the property level. In addition, other expenses incurred by our operating partnership will also be allocated by us, as general partner, to the property portfolio and will be included in the property-related expenses of that portfolio. Examples of such other expenses include:\n(i)corporate-level general and administrative expenses;\nFFO and Core FFO\nWe seek to own properties that are well located in high quality sub-markets with highly accessible street access and attractive supply and demand characteristics, providing our properties with strong and stable cash flows that are less sensitive to the fluctuations of the general economy. Many of these markets have multiple barriers to entry against increased supply, including zoning restrictions against new construction and new construction costs that we believe are higher than our properties' fair market value.\nRental Revenue\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\n(iii)the costs and expenses of organizing and operating our operating partnership;\n\nFollowing the allocation described above, we, as the general partner of our operating partnership, will generally cause our operating partnership to distribute the amounts allocated to the relevant series of subordinated performance units to the holders of such series of subordinated performance units. We, as general partner of our operating partnership, may cause our operating partnership to distribute the amounts allocated to the OP unitholders or may cause our operating partnership to retain such amounts to be used by our operating partnership for any purpose. Any capital transaction proceeds that are attributable to amounts retained by our operating partnership pursuant to the preceding sentence will generally be available to be allocated as an additional capital contribution to the various property portfolios.\nSecond, an amount determined by us, as the general partner, is allocated to the holders of the series of subordinated performance units relating to such property portfolio in order to provide such holders with a non-cumulative subordinated allocation on the unreturned capital contributions made by such holders in respect of such property portfolio that relate to such capital transaction plus an additional amount equal to such unreturned capital contributions.\nOur Property Management Platform\nThe availability of credit and its related effect on the overall economy may affect our liquidity and future financing activities, both through changes in interest rates and access to financing. Currently, interest rates are low compared to historical levels and many lenders are active in the market. We believe that, as a publicly-traded REIT, we will have access to multiple sources of capital to fund our long-term liquidity requirements, including the incurrence of additional debt and the issuance of debt and additional equity securities. However, we cannot assure you that this will be the case.\nSecond, an amount is allocated to the holders of the series of subordinated performance units relating to such property portfolio in order to provide such holders with an allocation (together with prior distributions of capital transaction proceeds) on their unreturned capital contributions. Although the subordinated allocation for the subordinated performance units is non-cumulative from period to period, if the operating cash flow from a property portfolio related to a series of subordinated performance units is sufficient, in the judgment of the general partner (with the approval of a majority of our independent trustees), to fund distributions to the holders of such series of subordinated performance units, but we, as the general partner of our operating partnership, decline to make distributions to such holders, the amount available but not paid as distributions will be added to the subordinated allocation corresponding to such series of subordinated performance units. The subordinated allocation for the outstanding subordinated performance units is 6%. As of December 31, 2019, an aggregate of $152.8 million of unreturned capital contributions has been allocated to the various series of subordinated performance units.\nProperty operating expenses were $110.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $103.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $6.4 million, or 6.2%. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, we adopted ASU 2016-02 and ASU 2018-11 effective January 1, 2019. As a result of this adoption, beginning on January 1, 2019, activity related to uncollectible accounts is recognized as a current-period adjustment within revenue. For periods prior to January 1, 2019, such amounts were previously\nFollowing the allocation described above, we as the general partner of our operating partnership, will generally cause our operating partnership to distribute the amounts allocated to the relevant series of subordinated performance units to the holders of such series of subordinated performance units. We, as the general partner, may cause our operating partnership to distribute the amounts allocated to OP unitholders or may cause our operating partnership to retain such amounts to be used by our operating partnership for any purpose. Any operating cash flow that is attributable to amounts retained by our operating partnership pursuant to the preceding sentence will generally be available to be allocated as an additional capital contribution to the various property portfolios.\nNational Storage Affiliates Trust is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust organized in the state of Maryland on May 16, 2013. We have elected and we believe that we have qualified to be taxed as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2015. We serve as the sole general partner of our operating partnership, a Delaware limited partnership formed on February 13, 2013 to conduct our business, which is focused on the ownership, operation, and acquisition of self storage properties located within the top 100 MSAs throughout the United States.\nFunds from operations, or FFO, is a widely used performance measure for real estate companies and is provided here as a supplemental measure of the Company's operating performance. The December 2018 Nareit Funds From Operations White Paper - 2018 Restatement, which we refer to as the White Paper, defines FFO as net income (as determined under GAAP), excluding: real estate depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, mark-to-market changes in value recognized on equity securities, impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and impairment of investments in entities when it is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity and after items to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis. Distributions declared on subordinated performance units and DownREIT subordinated performance units represent our allocation of FFO to noncontrolling interests held by subordinated performance unitholders and DownREIT subordinated performance unitholders. For purposes of calculating FFO attributable to common shareholders, OP unitholders, and LTIP unitholders, we exclude distributions declared on subordinated performance units, DownREIT subordinated performance units, preferred shares and preferred units. We define Core FFO as FFO, as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance. These further adjustments consist of acquisition costs, organizational and offering costs, gains on debt forgiveness, gains (losses) on early extinguishment of debt, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\n\u2022EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and\nOverview\nWe define EBITDA as net income (loss), as determined under GAAP, plus interest expense, loss on early extinguishment of debt, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense and the Company's share of unconsolidated real estate venture depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus acquisition costs, organizational and offering expenses, equity-based compensation expense, losses on sale of properties and impairment of long-lived assets, minus gains on sale of properties and debt forgiveness, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. These further adjustments eliminate the impact of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance. In evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nFinancing Activities\n\u2022EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debts;\nOur total revenue increased by $57.0 million, or 17.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily attributable to incremental revenue from 69 self storage properties acquired during the year ended December 31, 2019, increases in management fees and other revenue from our unconsolidated real estate ventures and regular rental increases for in-place tenants.\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our operating partnership and its controlled subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidation of entities.\n\u2022although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements;\nAllocation of Capital Contributions\n2016 Joint Venture\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\n\nIn connection with the 69 properties acquired during the year ended December 31, 2019, $51.8 million of OP equity was issued (consisting of 350,319 OP units, 340,702 Series A-1 preferred units and 1,178,400 subordinated performance units).\nAs of December 31, 2019, our 2018 Joint Venture, in which we have a 25% interest, owned and operated a portfolio of 103 properties containing approximately 7.7 million rentable square feet, configured in approximately 63,000 storage units and located across 17 states.\nFor a summary of our financial covenants and additional detail regarding our credit facility, 2023 Term Loan Facility, 2028 Term Loan Facility and 2029 Term Loan Facility, please see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\nInflation\n\u2022acquisitions capital expenditures, which represent the portion of capital expenditures capitalized during the current period that were identified and underwritten prior to a property's acquisition.\n(1)Includes scheduled principal and maturity payments related to our debt financings.\nFirst, an amount is allocated to OP unitholders in order to provide OP unitholders (together with any prior allocations of capital transaction proceeds) with a cumulative preferred allocation on the unreturned capital contributions attributed to the OP units in respect of such property portfolio. The preferred allocation for all of our existing portfolios is 6%. As of December 31, 2019, our operating partnership had an aggregate of $1,632.2 million of unreturned capital contributions with respect to common shareholders and OP unitholders, with respect to the various property portfolios.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our credit facility provided for total borrowings of $1.275 billion, consisting of five components: (i) a Revolver which provides for a total borrowing commitment up to $500.0 million, whereby we may borrow, repay and re-borrow amounts under the Revolver, (ii) a $125.0 million Term Loan A, (iii) a $250.0 million Term Loan B, (iv) a $225.0 million Term Loan C and (v) a $175.0 million Term Loan D. The Revolver matures in January 2024; provided that we may elect to extend the maturity to July 2024 by paying an extension fee of 0.075% of the total borrowing commitment thereunder at the time of extension and meeting other customary conditions with respect to compliance. The Term Loan A matures in January 2023, the Term Loan B matures in July 2024, the Term Loan C matures in January 2025 and the Term Loan D matures in July 2026. The Revolver, Term Loan A, Term Loan B, Term Loan C and Term Loan D are not subject to any scheduled reduction or amortization payments prior to maturity. As of December 31, 2019, we have an expansion option under the credit facility, which, if exercised in full, would provide for a total credit facility of $1.750 billion.\nContractual Obligations\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of property operating expenses, property acquisitions, capital expenditures, general and administrative expenses and principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness. A further short-term liquidity requirement relates to distributions to our common and preferred shareholders and holders of preferred units, OP units, subordinated performance units, DownREIT OP units and DownREIT subordinated performance units. We expect to fund short-term liquidity requirements from our operating cash flow, cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facility.\n\u2022NOI is widely used in the real estate industry and the self storage industry to measure the performance and value of real estate assets without regard to various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, such as depreciation and amortization, which can vary depending upon accounting methods, the book value of assets, and the impact of our capital structure; and\nWe have a 2028 Term Loan Facility that matures in December 2028 and is separate from the credit facility and 2023 Term Loan Facility in an aggregate amount of $75.0 million. As of December 31, 2019 the entire amount was outstanding under the 2028 Term Loan Facility with an effective interest rate of 4.62%. We have an expansion option under the 2028 Term Loan Facility, which, if exercised in full, would provide for total borrowings in an aggregate amount up to $125.0 million.\nOur Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures\nSeasonality\nsuch property portfolio that relate to such capital transaction plus an additional amount equal to such unreturned capital contributions.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had $20.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $3.7 million of restricted cash, an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $7.4 million and an increase in restricted cash of $0.5 million from December 31, 2018. Restricted cash primarily consists of escrowed funds deposited with financial institutions for real estate taxes, insurance, and other reserves for capital improvements in accordance with our loan agreements. The following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating, investing, and financing activities, which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included in Item 8 of this report.\nManagement uses FFO and Core FFO as key performance indicators in evaluating the operations of our properties. Given the nature of our business as a real estate owner and operator, we consider FFO and Core FFO as key supplemental measures of our operating performance that are not specifically defined by GAAP. We believe that FFO and Core FFO are useful to management and investors as a starting point in measuring our operational performance because FFO and Core FFO exclude various items included in net income (loss) that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating performance such as gains (or losses) from sales of self storage properties and depreciation, which can make periodic and peer analyses of operating performance more difficult. Our computation of FFO and Core FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies.\n\nThe following table summarizes information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding payments due under contractual obligations and commitments on an undiscounted basis as of December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands):\nDue to the stated liquidation priorities and because the HLBV method incorporates non-cash items such as depreciation expense, in any given period, income or loss may be allocated disproportionately to noncontrolling interests. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $62.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $42.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n(ii)out-of-pocket costs, expenses and fees of our operating partnership, whether or not capitalized;\nOverview\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2019, $125.0 million was outstanding under the Term Loan A with an effective interest rate of 3.74%, $250.0 million was outstanding under the Term Loan B with an effective interest rate of 2.91%, $225.0 million was outstanding under the Term Loan C with an effective interest rate of 2.80%, $175.0 million was outstanding under the Term Loan D with an effective interest rate of 3.57%. As of December 31, 2019, we would have had the capacity to borrow remaining Revolver commitments of $494.3 million while remaining in compliance with the credit facility's financial covenants.\nWe had ten PROs as of December 31, 2019: SecurCare, Northwest, Optivest, Guardian, Move It, Storage Solutions, Hide Away, Personal Mini, Southern and Moove In. We seek to further expand our platform by continuing to recruit additional established self storage operators, while integrating our operations through the implementation of centralized initiatives, including management information systems, revenue enhancement, and cost optimization programs. Our national platform allows us to capture cost savings by eliminating redundancies and utilizing economies of scale across the property management platforms of our PROs while also providing greater access to lower-cost capital.\nThrough our property management platform, branded iStorage, we direct, manage and control the day-to-day operations and affairs of certain consolidated properties and our unconsolidated real estate ventures. We earn certain customary fees for managing and operating the properties in the unconsolidated real estate ventures and we facilitate tenant insurance and/or tenant warranty protection programs for tenants at these properties in exchange for half of all proceeds from such programs.\n\u2022We believe NOI helps our investors to meaningfully compare the results of our operating performance from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense on our outstanding indebtedness) and depreciation of the cost basis of our assets from our operating results.\n\u2022value enhancing capital expenditures, which represent the portion of capital expenditures that are made to enhance the revenue and value of an asset from its original purchase condition; and\nTo help analyze the operating performance of our self storage properties, we also discuss and analyze operating results relating to our same store portfolio. Our same store portfolio is defined as those properties owned and operated since the first day of the earliest year presented, excluding any properties sold, expected to be sold or subject to significant changes such as expansions or casualty events which cause the portfolio's year-over-year operating results to no longer be comparable.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) to FFO and Core FFO for the periods presented (in thousands, except per share and unit amounts):\nDepreciation and amortization increased $16.0 million, or 17.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily attributable to incremental depreciation expense related to the 69 self storage properties acquired during 2019, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of customer in-place leases from $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWhen we obtain an economic interest in an entity, we evaluate the entity to determine if the entity is deemed a variable interest entity (\"VIE\"), and if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary, in accordance with authoritative guidance issued on the consolidation of VIEs. When an entity is not deemed to be a VIE, we consider the provisions of additional guidance to determine whether the general partner controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights. We consolidate all entities that are VIEs and of which the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary.\nThe limited partner ownership interests in our operating partnership that are held by owners other than us are referred to as noncontrolling interests. Noncontrolling interests also include ownership interests in DownREIT partnerships held by entities other than our operating partnership. Noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary are generally reported as a separate component of equity in our consolidated balance sheets. In our statements of operations, the revenues, expenses and net income or loss related to noncontrolling interests in our operating partnership are included in the consolidated amounts, with net income or loss attributable to the noncontrolling interests deducted separately to arrive at the net income or loss solely attributable to us.\nOperating Activities\nWhen reviewing our results of operations it is important to consider the timing of acquisition activity. We acquired 69 self storage properties during the year ended December 31, 2019 and 57 self storage properties during the year ended December 31, 2018. As a result of these and other factors, we do not believe that our historical results of operations discussed and analyzed below are comparable or necessarily indicative of our future results of operations or cash flows.\nDividends and Distributions\nGain On Sale of Self Storage Properties\nThe preferred allocation and subordinated allocation with respect to capital transaction proceeds for each portfolio is equal to the preferred allocation and subordinated allocation for distributions of operating cash flow with respect to that portfolio.\n(v)extraordinary expenses of our operating partnership not previously or otherwise deducted under item (ii) above;\n (1) Amounts represent distributions declared for subordinated performance unitholders and DownREIT subordinated performance unitholders for the periods presented. (2) NSA combines OP units and DownREIT OP units with common shares because, after the applicable lock-out periods, OP units in the Company's operating partnership are redeemable for cash or, at NSA's option, exchangeable for common shares on a one-for-one basis and DownREIT OP units are also redeemable for cash or, at NSA's option, exchangeable for OP units in our operating partnership on a one-for-one basis, subject to certain adjustments in each case. Subordinated performance units, DownREIT subordinated performance units, and LTIP units may also, under certain circumstances, be convertible into or exchangeable for common shares (or other units that are convertible into or exchangeable for common shares). See footnote(1) to the following table for additional discussion of subordinated performance units, DownREIT subordinated performance units, and LTIP units in the calculation of FFO and Core FFO per share and unit. \nAs of December 31, 2019, our property management platform managed and controlled 42 of our consolidated properties in select markets in California, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, Missouri, Ohio, Texas and Virginia.\n(ii)any incentive, financing, break-up and other fees paid to us by third parties;\nCash provided by our operating activities was $196.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $161.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $34.9 million. Our operating cash flow increased primarily due to 57 self storage properties acquired during the year ended December 31, 2018 that generated cash flow for the entire year ended December 31, 2019 and 69 self storage properties that were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, operating distributions from our unconsolidated real estate ventures increased by $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. These increases were partially offset by higher cash payments for general and administrative expenses and interest expense.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we entered into a credit agreement with a lender for the 2029 Term Loan Facility that matures in April 2029 and is separate from the credit facility, 2023 Term Loan Facility and 2028 Term Loan Facility in an aggregate amount of $100.0 million. As of December 31, 2019 the entire amount was outstanding under the 2029 Term Loan Facility with an effective interest rate of 4.27%.\nNet income was $66.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $56.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $9.7 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net operating income (\"NOI\") resulting from self storage properties acquired during 2018 and 2019, increases in management fees and other revenue, partially offset by increases in depreciation and amortization, interest expense and general and administrative expenses. For a description of NOI, see \"Non-GAAP Financial measures - NOI\".\n\nrequirements with operating cash flow, cash on hand, secured and unsecured indebtedness, and the issuance of equity and debt securities.\n(vi)any third-party costs and expenses associated with identifying, analyzing, and presenting a proposed property to us and/or our operating partnership; and\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe following discussion and analysis of the results of our operations and financial condition for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. The discussion and analysis of the results of our operations and financial condition for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, can be found in Part II, \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was filed with the SEC on February 26, 2019.\n2029 And 2031 Senior Unsecured Notes\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) to NOI for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\n\u2022other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\nTo the extent that we, as the general partner of our operating partnership, determine to make distributions to the partners of our operating partnership out of the operating cash flow of a real property portfolio managed by one of our PROs, operating cash flow from a property portfolio is required to be allocated to OP unitholders and to the holders of series of subordinated performance units that relate to such property portfolio as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2019, our 2016 Joint Venture, in which we have a 25% ownership interest, owned and operated a portfolio of 72 properties containing approximately 4.9 million rentable square feet, configured in approximately 40,000 storage units and located across 13 states.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nLiquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations. Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from our operations. Additional sources are proceeds from equity and debt offerings, and debt financings including borrowings under the credit facility, 2023 Term Loan Facility, 2028 Term Loan Facility and 2029 Term Loan Facility.\nOur structure promotes operator accountability as subordinated performance units issued to our PROs in exchange for the contribution of their properties are entitled to distributions only after those properties satisfy minimum performance thresholds. In the event of a material reduction in operating cash flow, distributions on our subordinated performance units will be reduced before or disproportionately to distributions on our common shares held by our common shareholders. In addition, we expect our PROs will generally co-invest subordinated equity in the form of subordinated performance units in each acquisition that they source, and the value of these subordinated performance units will fluctuate with the performance of their managed portfolios. Therefore, our PROs are incentivized to select acquisitions that are expected to exceed minimum performance thresholds, thereby increasing the value of their subordinated equity stake. We expect that our shareholders will benefit from the higher levels of property performance that our PROs are incentivized to deliver.\nOn February 20, 2020, our board of trustees declared a cash dividend and distribution, respectively, of $0.33 per common share and OP unit to shareholders and OP unitholders of record as of March 13, 2020. On February 20, 2020, our board of trustees also declared cash distributions of $0.375 per Series A Preferred Share and Series A-1 preferred unit to shareholders and unitholders of record as of March 13, 2020. In addition, we expect to declare a cash distribution in the first quarter of 2020 to our subordinated performance unitholders of record as of March 13, 2020. Such dividends and distributions are expected to be paid on March 31, 2020.\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Presentation of Noncontrolling Interests\n(iii)amounts released from previously set aside reserves; and\nThe self storage business is subject to minor seasonal fluctuations. A greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from May through September. Historically, our highest level of occupancy has typically been in July, while our lowest level of occupancy has typically been in February. Results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.\nCash provided by our financing activities was $204.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $352.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our sources of financing cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily consisted of $572.0 million of borrowings under our credit facility, $100.0 million of borrowings under our 2029 Term Loan Facility, $150.0 million of borrowings under our Senior Unsecured Notes, $70.6 million of proceeds from the issuance of common shares and $43.6 million of proceeds from the issuance of Series A Preferred Shares. Our primary uses of financing cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019 were for principal payments on existing debt of $561.6 million (which included $556.5 million of principal repayments under the Revolver and $5.1 million of scheduled fixed rate mortgage principal payments), distributions to noncontrolling interests of $76.0 million, distributions to common shareholders of $74.5 million and distributions to preferred shareholders of $12.4 million. Our sources of financing cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily consisted of $175.6 million of proceeds from the issuance of common shares, $672.5 million of borrowings under our credit facility, $75.0 million of borrowings under our 2023 Term Loan Facility and $75.0 million of borrowings under our 2028 Term Loan Facility. Our primary uses of financing cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018 were for principal payments on existing debt of $507.2 million (which included $496.5 million of principal repayments under the Revolver, $5.8 million of fixed rate mortgage principal payoffs and $4.9 million of scheduled fixed rate mortgage principal payments), distributions to noncontrolling interests of $63.4 million, distributions to common shareholders of $62.2 million and distributions to preferred shareholders of $10.4 million.\nProperty Operating Expenses\nFirst, an amount determined by us, as the general partner, of such capital transaction proceeds is allocated to OP unitholders in order to provide OP unitholders (together with any prior allocations of operating cash flow) with a cumulative preferred allocation on the unreturned capital contributions attributed to the OP unitholders in respect of\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nWe present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because we believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as an analytical tool. Some of these limitations are:\nSelf Storage Properties and Customer In-Place Leases\nOur financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those that impact our most critical accounting policies. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following are our most critical accounting policies.\nGain on sale of self storage properties was $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold one self storage property to an unrelated third party for gross proceeds of $6.5 million and during the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold two self storage properties to unrelated third parties for gross proceeds of $5.5 million.\n(iv)any other amounts received by us, which we allocate to the particular portfolio of properties.\nSelf storage properties are carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. When self storage properties are acquired, the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values. The purchase price is allocated to the individual properties based on the fair value determined using an income approach or a cash flow analysis using appropriate risk adjusted capitalization rates, which take into account the relative size, age, and location of the individual properties along with current and projected occupancy and relative rental rates or appraised values, if available. Tangible assets are allocated to land, buildings and related improvements, and furniture and equipment.\nInflation in the United States has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Although the impact of inflation has been relatively insignificant in recent years, it remains a factor in the U.S. economy and may increase the cost of acquiring or replacing self storage properties and related improvements, as well as real estate property taxes, employee salaries, wages and benefits, utilities, and other expenses. Because our tenant leases are month-to-month, we may be able to rapidly adjust our rental rates to minimize the adverse impact of any inflation which could mitigate our exposure to increases in costs and expenses resulting from inflation.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" as well as Item 1. \"Business,\" Item 1A. \"Risk Factors,\" and Item 2. \"Properties,\" respectively, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold 2,375,000 of our common shares and 1,785,680 of our Series A Preferred Shares through at the market offerings. The common shares were sold at an average offering price of $30.06 per share, resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $70.6 million after deducting compensation payable by us to such agents and offering expenses. The Series A Preferred Shares were sold at an average offering price of $24.84 per share, resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $43.6 million after deducting compensation payable by us to such agents and offering expenses.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, after receiving notices of redemption from certain OP unitholders, we elected to issue 581,001 common shares to such holders in exchange for 581,001 OP units in satisfaction of the operating partnership's redemption obligations.\nCash Distributions from our Operating Partnership\nResults of Operations\n\u2022EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures, contractual commitments or working capital needs;\n\nCash Flows\n(vii)reserves to meet anticipated operating expenditures, debt service or other liabilities, as determined by us.\n\u2022NOI is one of the primary measures used by our management and our PROs to evaluate the economic productivity of our properties, including our ability to lease our properties, increase pricing and occupancy and control our property operating expenses;\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nCash used in investing activities was $393.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $514.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The primary uses of cash for the year ended December 31, 2019 were for our acquisition of 69 self storage properties for cash consideration of $371.1 million, the acquisition of equity securities for $12.7 million, deposits for potential acquisitions of $4.4 million, capital expenditures of $20.6 million and the acquisition of the interest in a reinsurance company and related cash flows of $6.6 million, partially offset by distributions from unconsolidated real estate ventures of $11.5 million, $6.3 million of proceeds from the sale of one self storage property and $5.4 million of proceeds from the sale of equity securities. The primary uses of cash for the year ended December 31, 2018 were for our acquisition of 57 self storage properties and an expansion project for cash consideration of $313.7 million, investments in our unconsolidated real estate ventures of $165.6 million, deposits for acquisitions of $21.0 million and capital expenditures of $19.0 million, partially offset by $5.3 million of proceeds from the sale of two self storage properties.\nThe following table presents a summary of the capital expenditures for these categories, along with a reconciliation of the total for these categories to the capital expenditures reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\nOur consolidated NOI shown in the table above does not include our proportionate share of NOI for our unconsolidated real estate ventures. For additional information about our 2018 Joint Venture and 2016 Joint Venture see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\nThere are material limitations to using a non-GAAP measure such as NOI, including the difficulty associated with comparing results among more than one company and the inability to analyze certain significant items, including depreciation and interest expense, that directly affect our net income (loss). We compensate for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with our analysis of net income (loss). NOI should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP, such as total revenues, income from operations and net loss.\n(i)all receipts, including rents and other operating revenues;\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company issued 863,148 OP units upon conversion of 913,680 subordinated performance units and 13,475 DownREIT OP units upon conversion of 15,377 DownREIT subordinated performance units as further described under \"Subordinated Performance Units and DownREIT Subordinated Performance Units\" in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\nCapital expenditures totaled $20.6 million, $19.0 million and $14.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 respectively, we generally fund post-acquisition capital additions from cash provided by operating activities.\nEquity Transactions\nWe have a 2023 Term Loan Facility that matures in June 2023 and is separate from the credit facility in an aggregate amount of $175.0 million. As of December 31, 2019 the entire amount was outstanding under the 2023\nLiquidity Overview\nincluded in operating expenses, and as such, for comparability, we have presented $8.6 million of activity related to uncollectible accounts as a reduction to same store and non-same store property operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in property operating expenses resulted from a $13.6 million increase in non-same store property operating expenses that was primarily attributable to incremental property operating expenses of $9.3 million from 69 self storage properties acquired during 2019, and $4.6 million from 57 self storage properties acquired during 2018.\nNotwithstanding the two-year lock out period on conversions of subordinated performance units into OP units, if such subordinated performance units were convertible into OP units as of December 31, 2019, each subordinated performance unit would on average hypothetically convert into 1.48 OP units, or into an aggregate of approximately 22.8 million OP units. These amounts are based on historical financial information for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The hypothetical conversion is calculated by dividing the average cash available for distribution, or CAD, per subordinated performance unit by 110% of the CAD per OP unit over the same period. We anticipate that as our CAD grows over time, the conversion ratio will also grow, including to levels that may exceed this amount. The actual number of OP units into which such subordinated performance units will become convertible may vary significantly and will depend upon the applicable conversion penalty and the actual CAD to the OP units and the actual CAD to the converted subordinated performance units in the one-year period ending prior to conversion. We have also granted registration rights to those persons who will be eligible to receive common shares issuable upon exchange of OP units issued in our formation transactions and certain contribution transactions.\nOur PROs\nInterest expense increased $13.7 million, or 32.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to additional borrowings consisting of $155.0 million of additional term loan borrowings under the Company's credit facility on July 29, 2019 and $100.0 million of borrowings under the 2029 Term Loan Facility. Additionally, on August 30, 2019, our operating partnership issued the $150.0 million Senior Unsecured Notes in a private placement to certain accredited investors. The increase in interest expense from these additional borrowings was partially offset by lower outstanding borrowings under the Revolver.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our same store portfolio consisted of 439 self storage properties. See \"---Results of Operations\" above for the definition of our same store portfolio. The following table illustrates the changes in rental revenue, other property-related revenue, management fees and other revenue, property operating expenses, and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):\nCredit Facility and Term Loan Facilities\nOur long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of the repayment of debt, property acquisitions, and capital expenditures. We acquire properties through the use of cash, preferred units, OP units and subordinated performance units in our operating partnership or DownREIT partnerships. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity\nOur Structure\nTerm Loan Facility with an effective interest rate of 2.83%. We have an expansion option under the 2023 Term Loan Facility, which, if exercised in full, would provide for total borrowings in an aggregate amount of $400.0 million.\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA excludes equity-based compensation expense, which is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term incentive compensation package, although we exclude it as an expense when evaluating our ongoing operating performance for a particular period;\nWe define NOI as net income (loss), as determined under GAAP, plus general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, loss on early extinguishment of debt, equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated real estate ventures, acquisition costs, organizational and offering expenses, income tax expense, impairment of long-lived assets, losses on the sale of properties and non-operating expense and by subtracting management fees and other revenue, gains on sale of properties, debt forgiveness, and non-operating income. NOI is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n\u2022recurring capital expenditures, which represent the portion of capital expenditures that are deemed to replace the consumed portion of acquired capital assets and extend their useful life;\nInterest Expense\nWe compensate for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with our analysis of net income (loss). EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP, such as total revenues, income from operations, and net income (loss).\nWe believe NOI is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because:\nManagement fees and other revenue, which are primarily related to managing and operating the unconsolidated real estate ventures, were $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $8.4 million or 68.4%. This increase was primarily attributable to incremental fees earned from the 2018 Joint Venture following the acquisition of the Initial 2018 JV Portfolio (as defined in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8) in September 2018.", "item_7_text": "During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company issued 37,770 common shares in exchange for $1.3 million of principal payment reimbursements received during the year ended December 31, 2019 related to mortgages assumed in connection with the acquisition of self storage properties from PROs during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $9.4 million, or 25.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was attributable to increases in supervisory and administrative fees charged by our PROs of $3.1 million primarily as a result of incremental fees related to the 69 self storage properties acquired during 2019, costs related to our property management platform of $2.3 million, salaries and benefits of $2.2 million, equity-based compensation expense of $0.7 million and $1.1 million of other general and administrative expenses.\nEquity In Losses Of Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures\nOther Property-Related Revenue\nEquity in losses of unconsolidated real estate ventures represents our share of losses incurred through our 25% ownership interests in the 2018 Joint Venture and the 2016 Joint Venture. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded $5.0 million of equity in losses from our unconsolidated real estate ventures compared to $1.4 million of losses for the year ended December 31, 2018. This was primarily the result of incremental losses from our 2018 Joint Venture driven by real estate depreciation and amortization of customer in-place leases following the acquisition of the Initial 2018 JV Portfolio in September 2018.\nIn allocating the purchase price for a self storage property acquisition, we determine whether the acquisition includes intangible assets. We allocate a portion of the purchase price to an intangible asset attributed to the value of customer in-place leases. Because the majority of tenant leases are on a month-to-month basis, this intangible asset represents the estimated value of the leases in effect on the acquisition date. This intangible asset is amortized to expense using the straight-line method over 12 months, the estimated average remaining rental period for the leases.\nFFO and Core FFO should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP, such as total revenues, operating income and net income (loss). FFO and Core FFO do not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and are not a measure of liquidity or an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO and Core FFO should be compared with our reported net income (loss) and considered in addition to cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements.\nSegment\nWe categorize our capital expenditures broadly into three primary categories:\nWe seek to opportunistically partner with institutional funds and other institutional investors to acquire attractive portfolios utilizing a promoted return structure. We believe there is significant opportunity for continued external growth by partnering with institutional investors seeking to deploy capital in the self storage industry.\n2018 Joint Venture\n\nWe, as the general partner of our operating partnership, in our discretion, have the right to increase or decrease, as appropriate, the amount of capital contributions allocated to our operating partnership in general and to each series of subordinated performance units to reflect capital expenditures made by our operating partnership in respect of each portfolio, the sale or refinancing of all or a portion of the properties comprising the portfolio, the distribution of capital transaction proceeds by our operating partnership, the retention by our operating partnership of cash for working capital purposes and other events impacting the amount of capital contributions allocated to the holders. In addition, to avoid conflicts of interests, any decision by us to increase or decrease allocations of capital contributions must also be approved by a majority of our independent trustees.\nOur Consolidated Properties\n(iv)amounts paid or due in respect of any loan or other indebtedness of our operating partnership during such period;\nUnder the LP Agreement of our operating partnership, capital transactions are transactions that are outside the ordinary course of our operating partnership's business, involve the sale, exchange, other disposition, or refinancing of any property, and are designated as capital transactions by us, as the general partner. To the extent the general partner determines to distribute capital transaction proceeds, the proceeds from capital transactions involving a particular property portfolio are required to be allocated to OP unitholders and to the series of subordinated performance units that relate to such property portfolio as follows:\nExcept as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements, as of December 31, 2019, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities, which typically are established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements, as of December 31, 2019, we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor made any commitments to provide funding to any such entities that creates any material exposure to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nRental revenue increased by $46.5 million, or 15.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, we adopted ASU 2016-02 and ASU 2018-11 effective January 1, 2019. As a result of this adoption, beginning on January 1, 2019, activity related to uncollectible accounts is recognized as a current-period adjustment within revenue. For periods prior to January 1, 2019, such amounts were previously included in operating expenses, and as such, for comparability, we have presented $8.6 million of activity related to uncollectible accounts as a reduction to same store and non-same store rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in rental revenue was due to a $44.2 million increase in non-same store rental revenue which was primarily attributable to incremental rental revenue of $29.6 million from 69 self storage properties acquired during 2019, and $15.4 million from 57 self storage properties acquired during 2018. Same store portfolio rental revenues increased $10.8 million, or 3.9%, due to a 3.5% increase, from $11.58 to $11.98, in annualized same store rental revenue (including fees and net of any discounts and uncollectible customer amounts) divided by average occupied square feet (\"average annualized rental revenue per occupied square foot\"), driven primarily by increased contractual lease rates for in-place tenants and fees and an increase in average occupancy from 88.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 88.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Average occupancy is calculated based on the average of the month-end occupancy immediately preceding the period presented and the month-end occupancies included in the respective period presented.\nNOI\nUnder the LP Agreement of our operating partnership, to the extent that we, as the general partner of our operating partnership, determine to make distributions to the partners of our operating partnership out of the operating cash flow or capital transaction proceeds generated by a real property portfolio managed by one of our PROs, the holders of the series of subordinated performance units that relate to such portfolio are entitled to share in such distributions. Under the LP Agreement of our operating partnership, operating cash flow with respect to a portfolio of properties managed by one of our PROs is generally an amount determined by us, as general partner of our operating partnership, equal to the excess of property revenues over property related expenses from that portfolio. In general, property revenue from the portfolio includes:\nInvesting Activities\nTotal Revenue\n(2)Interest is calculated until the maturity date (without regard to any extension that may be elected by the Company) based on the outstanding principal balance and the effective interest rate as of December 31, 2019.\nCertain figures, such as interest rates and other percentages, included in this section have been rounded for ease of presentation. Percentage figures included in this section have not in all cases been calculated on the basis of such rounded figures but on the basis of such amounts prior to rounding. For this reason, percentage amounts in this section may vary slightly from those obtained by performing the same calculations using the figures in our consolidated financial statements or in the associated text. Certain other amounts that appear in this section may similarly not sum due to rounding.\nThe foregoing allocation of capital transaction proceeds between the OP unitholders and subordinated performance unitholders is used for purposes of determining distributions to holders of subordinated performance units but does not necessarily represent the capital transaction proceeds that will be distributed to OP unitholders (or paid as dividends to holders of our common shares). Any distribution of capital transaction proceeds allocated to the OP unitholders will be made at our discretion (and paid as dividends to holders of our common shares at the discretion of our board of trustees).\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, we allocate U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") income (loss) utilizing the HLBV method, in which we allocate income or loss based on the change in each unitholders' claim on the net assets of our operating partnership at period end after adjusting for any distributions or contributions made during such period.\nWe manage our business as one reportable segment consisting of investments in self storage properties located in the United States. Although we operate in several markets, these operations have been aggregated into one reportable segment based on the similar economic characteristics among all markets.\nIssuance of Common Shares and Series A Preferred Shares\nThereafter, any additional capital transaction proceeds are allocated to OP unitholders and the applicable series of subordinated performance units equally.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we owned a geographically diversified portfolio of 567 self storage properties, located in 29 states and Puerto Rico, comprising approximately 34.5 million rentable square feet, configured in approximately 275,000 storage units. Of these properties, 265 were acquired by us from our PROs, 301 were acquired by us from third-party sellers and one was acquired by us from the 2016 Joint Venture.\nThereafter, any additional operating cash flow is allocated to OP unitholders and the applicable series of subordinated performance units equally.\nThe foregoing description of the allocation of operating cash flow between the OP unitholders and subordinated performance unitholders is used for purposes of determining distributions to holders of subordinated performance units but does not necessarily represent the operating cash flow that will be distributed to OP unitholders (or paid as dividends to holders of our common shares). Any distribution of operating cash flow allocated to the OP unitholders will be made at our discretion (and paid as dividends to holders of our common shares at the discretion of our board of trustees).\nOur OP units are redeemable for cash or, at our option exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into common shares after an agreed period of time and certain other conditions. Our subordinated performance units are only convertible into OP units following a two year lock-out period and then (i) at the holder's election only upon the achievement of certain performance thresholds relating to the properties to which such subordinated performance units relate or (ii) at our election upon a retirement event of a PRO that holds such subordinated performance units or upon certain qualifying terminations.\nOther property-related revenue represents ancillary income from our self storage properties, such as tenant insurance-related access fees and sales of storage supplies. Other property-related revenue increased by $2.1 million, or 20.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase primarily resulted from a $1.6 million increase in non-same store other property-related revenue which was primarily attributable to incremental other property-related revenue of $0.8 million from 69 self storage properties acquired during 2019, and $0.8 million from 57 self storage properties acquired during 2018.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company paid $74.5 million of distributions to common shareholders, $12.4 million of distributions to preferred shareholders and distributed $76.0 million to noncontrolling interests.\nAs discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, on August 30, 2019, our operating partnership issued $100.0 million of 3.98% senior unsecured notes due August 30, 2029 and $50.0 million of 4.08% senior unsecured notes due August 30, 2031 in a private placement to certain accredited investors.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of earnings (loss) per share - diluted to FFO and Core FFO per share and unit for the periods presented:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, our 2016 Joint Venture sold to the Company one self storage property for $4.1 million, comprising less than 0.1 million rentable square feet, configured in approximately 300 storage units.\n\nIssuance of OP Equity\nManagement Fees and Other Revenue\nIn general, property-related expenses include all direct expenses related to the operation of the properties in that portfolio, including real property taxes, insurance, property-level general and administrative expenses, employee costs, utilities, property marketing expense, property maintenance and property reserves and other expenses incurred at the property level. In addition, other expenses incurred by our operating partnership will also be allocated by us, as general partner, to the property portfolio and will be included in the property-related expenses of that portfolio. Examples of such other expenses include:\n(i)corporate-level general and administrative expenses;\nFFO and Core FFO\nWe seek to own properties that are well located in high quality sub-markets with highly accessible street access and attractive supply and demand characteristics, providing our properties with strong and stable cash flows that are less sensitive to the fluctuations of the general economy. Many of these markets have multiple barriers to entry against increased supply, including zoning restrictions against new construction and new construction costs that we believe are higher than our properties' fair market value.\nRental Revenue\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\n(iii)the costs and expenses of organizing and operating our operating partnership;\n\nFollowing the allocation described above, we, as the general partner of our operating partnership, will generally cause our operating partnership to distribute the amounts allocated to the relevant series of subordinated performance units to the holders of such series of subordinated performance units. We, as general partner of our operating partnership, may cause our operating partnership to distribute the amounts allocated to the OP unitholders or may cause our operating partnership to retain such amounts to be used by our operating partnership for any purpose. Any capital transaction proceeds that are attributable to amounts retained by our operating partnership pursuant to the preceding sentence will generally be available to be allocated as an additional capital contribution to the various property portfolios.\nSecond, an amount determined by us, as the general partner, is allocated to the holders of the series of subordinated performance units relating to such property portfolio in order to provide such holders with a non-cumulative subordinated allocation on the unreturned capital contributions made by such holders in respect of such property portfolio that relate to such capital transaction plus an additional amount equal to such unreturned capital contributions.\nOur Property Management Platform\nThe availability of credit and its related effect on the overall economy may affect our liquidity and future financing activities, both through changes in interest rates and access to financing. Currently, interest rates are low compared to historical levels and many lenders are active in the market. We believe that, as a publicly-traded REIT, we will have access to multiple sources of capital to fund our long-term liquidity requirements, including the incurrence of additional debt and the issuance of debt and additional equity securities. However, we cannot assure you that this will be the case.\nSecond, an amount is allocated to the holders of the series of subordinated performance units relating to such property portfolio in order to provide such holders with an allocation (together with prior distributions of capital transaction proceeds) on their unreturned capital contributions. Although the subordinated allocation for the subordinated performance units is non-cumulative from period to period, if the operating cash flow from a property portfolio related to a series of subordinated performance units is sufficient, in the judgment of the general partner (with the approval of a majority of our independent trustees), to fund distributions to the holders of such series of subordinated performance units, but we, as the general partner of our operating partnership, decline to make distributions to such holders, the amount available but not paid as distributions will be added to the subordinated allocation corresponding to such series of subordinated performance units. The subordinated allocation for the outstanding subordinated performance units is 6%. As of December 31, 2019, an aggregate of $152.8 million of unreturned capital contributions has been allocated to the various series of subordinated performance units.\nProperty operating expenses were $110.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $103.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $6.4 million, or 6.2%. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, we adopted ASU 2016-02 and ASU 2018-11 effective January 1, 2019. As a result of this adoption, beginning on January 1, 2019, activity related to uncollectible accounts is recognized as a current-period adjustment within revenue. For periods prior to January 1, 2019, such amounts were previously\nFollowing the allocation described above, we as the general partner of our operating partnership, will generally cause our operating partnership to distribute the amounts allocated to the relevant series of subordinated performance units to the holders of such series of subordinated performance units. We, as the general partner, may cause our operating partnership to distribute the amounts allocated to OP unitholders or may cause our operating partnership to retain such amounts to be used by our operating partnership for any purpose. Any operating cash flow that is attributable to amounts retained by our operating partnership pursuant to the preceding sentence will generally be available to be allocated as an additional capital contribution to the various property portfolios.\nNational Storage Affiliates Trust is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust organized in the state of Maryland on May 16, 2013. We have elected and we believe that we have qualified to be taxed as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2015. We serve as the sole general partner of our operating partnership, a Delaware limited partnership formed on February 13, 2013 to conduct our business, which is focused on the ownership, operation, and acquisition of self storage properties located within the top 100 MSAs throughout the United States.\nFunds from operations, or FFO, is a widely used performance measure for real estate companies and is provided here as a supplemental measure of the Company's operating performance. The December 2018 Nareit Funds From Operations White Paper - 2018 Restatement, which we refer to as the White Paper, defines FFO as net income (as determined under GAAP), excluding: real estate depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, mark-to-market changes in value recognized on equity securities, impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and impairment of investments in entities when it is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity and after items to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis. Distributions declared on subordinated performance units and DownREIT subordinated performance units represent our allocation of FFO to noncontrolling interests held by subordinated performance unitholders and DownREIT subordinated performance unitholders. For purposes of calculating FFO attributable to common shareholders, OP unitholders, and LTIP unitholders, we exclude distributions declared on subordinated performance units, DownREIT subordinated performance units, preferred shares and preferred units. We define Core FFO as FFO, as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance. These further adjustments consist of acquisition costs, organizational and offering costs, gains on debt forgiveness, gains (losses) on early extinguishment of debt, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\n\u2022EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and\nOverview\nWe define EBITDA as net income (loss), as determined under GAAP, plus interest expense, loss on early extinguishment of debt, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense and the Company's share of unconsolidated real estate venture depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus acquisition costs, organizational and offering expenses, equity-based compensation expense, losses on sale of properties and impairment of long-lived assets, minus gains on sale of properties and debt forgiveness, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. These further adjustments eliminate the impact of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance. In evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nFinancing Activities\n\u2022EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debts;\nOur total revenue increased by $57.0 million, or 17.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily attributable to incremental revenue from 69 self storage properties acquired during the year ended December 31, 2019, increases in management fees and other revenue from our unconsolidated real estate ventures and regular rental increases for in-place tenants.\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our operating partnership and its controlled subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidation of entities.\n\u2022although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements;\nAllocation of Capital Contributions\n2016 Joint Venture\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\n\nIn connection with the 69 properties acquired during the year ended December 31, 2019, $51.8 million of OP equity was issued (consisting of 350,319 OP units, 340,702 Series A-1 preferred units and 1,178,400 subordinated performance units).\nAs of December 31, 2019, our 2018 Joint Venture, in which we have a 25% interest, owned and operated a portfolio of 103 properties containing approximately 7.7 million rentable square feet, configured in approximately 63,000 storage units and located across 17 states.\nFor a summary of our financial covenants and additional detail regarding our credit facility, 2023 Term Loan Facility, 2028 Term Loan Facility and 2029 Term Loan Facility, please see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\nInflation\n\u2022acquisitions capital expenditures, which represent the portion of capital expenditures capitalized during the current period that were identified and underwritten prior to a property's acquisition.\n(1)Includes scheduled principal and maturity payments related to our debt financings.\nFirst, an amount is allocated to OP unitholders in order to provide OP unitholders (together with any prior allocations of capital transaction proceeds) with a cumulative preferred allocation on the unreturned capital contributions attributed to the OP units in respect of such property portfolio. The preferred allocation for all of our existing portfolios is 6%. As of December 31, 2019, our operating partnership had an aggregate of $1,632.2 million of unreturned capital contributions with respect to common shareholders and OP unitholders, with respect to the various property portfolios.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our credit facility provided for total borrowings of $1.275 billion, consisting of five components: (i) a Revolver which provides for a total borrowing commitment up to $500.0 million, whereby we may borrow, repay and re-borrow amounts under the Revolver, (ii) a $125.0 million Term Loan A, (iii) a $250.0 million Term Loan B, (iv) a $225.0 million Term Loan C and (v) a $175.0 million Term Loan D. The Revolver matures in January 2024; provided that we may elect to extend the maturity to July 2024 by paying an extension fee of 0.075% of the total borrowing commitment thereunder at the time of extension and meeting other customary conditions with respect to compliance. The Term Loan A matures in January 2023, the Term Loan B matures in July 2024, the Term Loan C matures in January 2025 and the Term Loan D matures in July 2026. The Revolver, Term Loan A, Term Loan B, Term Loan C and Term Loan D are not subject to any scheduled reduction or amortization payments prior to maturity. As of December 31, 2019, we have an expansion option under the credit facility, which, if exercised in full, would provide for a total credit facility of $1.750 billion.\nContractual Obligations\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of property operating expenses, property acquisitions, capital expenditures, general and administrative expenses and principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness. A further short-term liquidity requirement relates to distributions to our common and preferred shareholders and holders of preferred units, OP units, subordinated performance units, DownREIT OP units and DownREIT subordinated performance units. We expect to fund short-term liquidity requirements from our operating cash flow, cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facility.\n\u2022NOI is widely used in the real estate industry and the self storage industry to measure the performance and value of real estate assets without regard to various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, such as depreciation and amortization, which can vary depending upon accounting methods, the book value of assets, and the impact of our capital structure; and\nWe have a 2028 Term Loan Facility that matures in December 2028 and is separate from the credit facility and 2023 Term Loan Facility in an aggregate amount of $75.0 million. As of December 31, 2019 the entire amount was outstanding under the 2028 Term Loan Facility with an effective interest rate of 4.62%. We have an expansion option under the 2028 Term Loan Facility, which, if exercised in full, would provide for total borrowings in an aggregate amount up to $125.0 million.\nOur Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures\nSeasonality\nsuch property portfolio that relate to such capital transaction plus an additional amount equal to such unreturned capital contributions.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had $20.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $3.7 million of restricted cash, an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $7.4 million and an increase in restricted cash of $0.5 million from December 31, 2018. Restricted cash primarily consists of escrowed funds deposited with financial institutions for real estate taxes, insurance, and other reserves for capital improvements in accordance with our loan agreements. The following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating, investing, and financing activities, which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included in Item 8 of this report.\nManagement uses FFO and Core FFO as key performance indicators in evaluating the operations of our properties. Given the nature of our business as a real estate owner and operator, we consider FFO and Core FFO as key supplemental measures of our operating performance that are not specifically defined by GAAP. We believe that FFO and Core FFO are useful to management and investors as a starting point in measuring our operational performance because FFO and Core FFO exclude various items included in net income (loss) that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating performance such as gains (or losses) from sales of self storage properties and depreciation, which can make periodic and peer analyses of operating performance more difficult. Our computation of FFO and Core FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies.\n\nThe following table summarizes information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding payments due under contractual obligations and commitments on an undiscounted basis as of December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands):\nDue to the stated liquidation priorities and because the HLBV method incorporates non-cash items such as depreciation expense, in any given period, income or loss may be allocated disproportionately to noncontrolling interests. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $62.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $42.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n(ii)out-of-pocket costs, expenses and fees of our operating partnership, whether or not capitalized;\nOverview\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2019, $125.0 million was outstanding under the Term Loan A with an effective interest rate of 3.74%, $250.0 million was outstanding under the Term Loan B with an effective interest rate of 2.91%, $225.0 million was outstanding under the Term Loan C with an effective interest rate of 2.80%, $175.0 million was outstanding under the Term Loan D with an effective interest rate of 3.57%. As of December 31, 2019, we would have had the capacity to borrow remaining Revolver commitments of $494.3 million while remaining in compliance with the credit facility's financial covenants.\nWe had ten PROs as of December 31, 2019: SecurCare, Northwest, Optivest, Guardian, Move It, Storage Solutions, Hide Away, Personal Mini, Southern and Moove In. We seek to further expand our platform by continuing to recruit additional established self storage operators, while integrating our operations through the implementation of centralized initiatives, including management information systems, revenue enhancement, and cost optimization programs. Our national platform allows us to capture cost savings by eliminating redundancies and utilizing economies of scale across the property management platforms of our PROs while also providing greater access to lower-cost capital.\nThrough our property management platform, branded iStorage, we direct, manage and control the day-to-day operations and affairs of certain consolidated properties and our unconsolidated real estate ventures. We earn certain customary fees for managing and operating the properties in the unconsolidated real estate ventures and we facilitate tenant insurance and/or tenant warranty protection programs for tenants at these properties in exchange for half of all proceeds from such programs.\n\u2022We believe NOI helps our investors to meaningfully compare the results of our operating performance from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense on our outstanding indebtedness) and depreciation of the cost basis of our assets from our operating results.\n\u2022value enhancing capital expenditures, which represent the portion of capital expenditures that are made to enhance the revenue and value of an asset from its original purchase condition; and\nTo help analyze the operating performance of our self storage properties, we also discuss and analyze operating results relating to our same store portfolio. Our same store portfolio is defined as those properties owned and operated since the first day of the earliest year presented, excluding any properties sold, expected to be sold or subject to significant changes such as expansions or casualty events which cause the portfolio's year-over-year operating results to no longer be comparable.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) to FFO and Core FFO for the periods presented (in thousands, except per share and unit amounts):\nDepreciation and amortization increased $16.0 million, or 17.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily attributable to incremental depreciation expense related to the 69 self storage properties acquired during 2019, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of customer in-place leases from $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWhen we obtain an economic interest in an entity, we evaluate the entity to determine if the entity is deemed a variable interest entity (\"VIE\"), and if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary, in accordance with authoritative guidance issued on the consolidation of VIEs. When an entity is not deemed to be a VIE, we consider the provisions of additional guidance to determine whether the general partner controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights. We consolidate all entities that are VIEs and of which the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary.\nThe limited partner ownership interests in our operating partnership that are held by owners other than us are referred to as noncontrolling interests. Noncontrolling interests also include ownership interests in DownREIT partnerships held by entities other than our operating partnership. Noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary are generally reported as a separate component of equity in our consolidated balance sheets. In our statements of operations, the revenues, expenses and net income or loss related to noncontrolling interests in our operating partnership are included in the consolidated amounts, with net income or loss attributable to the noncontrolling interests deducted separately to arrive at the net income or loss solely attributable to us.\nOperating Activities\nWhen reviewing our results of operations it is important to consider the timing of acquisition activity. We acquired 69 self storage properties during the year ended December 31, 2019 and 57 self storage properties during the year ended December 31, 2018. As a result of these and other factors, we do not believe that our historical results of operations discussed and analyzed below are comparable or necessarily indicative of our future results of operations or cash flows.\nDividends and Distributions\nGain On Sale of Self Storage Properties\nThe preferred allocation and subordinated allocation with respect to capital transaction proceeds for each portfolio is equal to the preferred allocation and subordinated allocation for distributions of operating cash flow with respect to that portfolio.\n(v)extraordinary expenses of our operating partnership not previously or otherwise deducted under item (ii) above;\n (1) Amounts represent distributions declared for subordinated performance unitholders and DownREIT subordinated performance unitholders for the periods presented. (2) NSA combines OP units and DownREIT OP units with common shares because, after the applicable lock-out periods, OP units in the Company's operating partnership are redeemable for cash or, at NSA's option, exchangeable for common shares on a one-for-one basis and DownREIT OP units are also redeemable for cash or, at NSA's option, exchangeable for OP units in our operating partnership on a one-for-one basis, subject to certain adjustments in each case. Subordinated performance units, DownREIT subordinated performance units, and LTIP units may also, under certain circumstances, be convertible into or exchangeable for common shares (or other units that are convertible into or exchangeable for common shares). See footnote(1) to the following table for additional discussion of subordinated performance units, DownREIT subordinated performance units, and LTIP units in the calculation of FFO and Core FFO per share and unit. \nAs of December 31, 2019, our property management platform managed and controlled 42 of our consolidated properties in select markets in California, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, Missouri, Ohio, Texas and Virginia.\n(ii)any incentive, financing, break-up and other fees paid to us by third parties;\nCash provided by our operating activities was $196.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $161.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $34.9 million. Our operating cash flow increased primarily due to 57 self storage properties acquired during the year ended December 31, 2018 that generated cash flow for the entire year ended December 31, 2019 and 69 self storage properties that were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, operating distributions from our unconsolidated real estate ventures increased by $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. These increases were partially offset by higher cash payments for general and administrative expenses and interest expense.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we entered into a credit agreement with a lender for the 2029 Term Loan Facility that matures in April 2029 and is separate from the credit facility, 2023 Term Loan Facility and 2028 Term Loan Facility in an aggregate amount of $100.0 million. As of December 31, 2019 the entire amount was outstanding under the 2029 Term Loan Facility with an effective interest rate of 4.27%.\nNet income was $66.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $56.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $9.7 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net operating income (\"NOI\") resulting from self storage properties acquired during 2018 and 2019, increases in management fees and other revenue, partially offset by increases in depreciation and amortization, interest expense and general and administrative expenses. For a description of NOI, see \"Non-GAAP Financial measures - NOI\".\n\nrequirements with operating cash flow, cash on hand, secured and unsecured indebtedness, and the issuance of equity and debt securities.\n(vi)any third-party costs and expenses associated with identifying, analyzing, and presenting a proposed property to us and/or our operating partnership; and\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe following discussion and analysis of the results of our operations and financial condition for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. The discussion and analysis of the results of our operations and financial condition for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, can be found in Part II, \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was filed with the SEC on February 26, 2019.\n2029 And 2031 Senior Unsecured Notes\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) to NOI for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\n\u2022other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\nTo the extent that we, as the general partner of our operating partnership, determine to make distributions to the partners of our operating partnership out of the operating cash flow of a real property portfolio managed by one of our PROs, operating cash flow from a property portfolio is required to be allocated to OP unitholders and to the holders of series of subordinated performance units that relate to such property portfolio as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2019, our 2016 Joint Venture, in which we have a 25% ownership interest, owned and operated a portfolio of 72 properties containing approximately 4.9 million rentable square feet, configured in approximately 40,000 storage units and located across 13 states.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nLiquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations. Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from our operations. Additional sources are proceeds from equity and debt offerings, and debt financings including borrowings under the credit facility, 2023 Term Loan Facility, 2028 Term Loan Facility and 2029 Term Loan Facility.\nOur structure promotes operator accountability as subordinated performance units issued to our PROs in exchange for the contribution of their properties are entitled to distributions only after those properties satisfy minimum performance thresholds. In the event of a material reduction in operating cash flow, distributions on our subordinated performance units will be reduced before or disproportionately to distributions on our common shares held by our common shareholders. In addition, we expect our PROs will generally co-invest subordinated equity in the form of subordinated performance units in each acquisition that they source, and the value of these subordinated performance units will fluctuate with the performance of their managed portfolios. Therefore, our PROs are incentivized to select acquisitions that are expected to exceed minimum performance thresholds, thereby increasing the value of their subordinated equity stake. We expect that our shareholders will benefit from the higher levels of property performance that our PROs are incentivized to deliver.\nOn February 20, 2020, our board of trustees declared a cash dividend and distribution, respectively, of $0.33 per common share and OP unit to shareholders and OP unitholders of record as of March 13, 2020. On February 20, 2020, our board of trustees also declared cash distributions of $0.375 per Series A Preferred Share and Series A-1 preferred unit to shareholders and unitholders of record as of March 13, 2020. In addition, we expect to declare a cash distribution in the first quarter of 2020 to our subordinated performance unitholders of record as of March 13, 2020. Such dividends and distributions are expected to be paid on March 31, 2020.\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Presentation of Noncontrolling Interests\n(iii)amounts released from previously set aside reserves; and\nThe self storage business is subject to minor seasonal fluctuations. A greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from May through September. Historically, our highest level of occupancy has typically been in July, while our lowest level of occupancy has typically been in February. Results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.\nCash provided by our financing activities was $204.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $352.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our sources of financing cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily consisted of $572.0 million of borrowings under our credit facility, $100.0 million of borrowings under our 2029 Term Loan Facility, $150.0 million of borrowings under our Senior Unsecured Notes, $70.6 million of proceeds from the issuance of common shares and $43.6 million of proceeds from the issuance of Series A Preferred Shares. Our primary uses of financing cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019 were for principal payments on existing debt of $561.6 million (which included $556.5 million of principal repayments under the Revolver and $5.1 million of scheduled fixed rate mortgage principal payments), distributions to noncontrolling interests of $76.0 million, distributions to common shareholders of $74.5 million and distributions to preferred shareholders of $12.4 million. Our sources of financing cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily consisted of $175.6 million of proceeds from the issuance of common shares, $672.5 million of borrowings under our credit facility, $75.0 million of borrowings under our 2023 Term Loan Facility and $75.0 million of borrowings under our 2028 Term Loan Facility. Our primary uses of financing cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018 were for principal payments on existing debt of $507.2 million (which included $496.5 million of principal repayments under the Revolver, $5.8 million of fixed rate mortgage principal payoffs and $4.9 million of scheduled fixed rate mortgage principal payments), distributions to noncontrolling interests of $63.4 million, distributions to common shareholders of $62.2 million and distributions to preferred shareholders of $10.4 million.\nProperty Operating Expenses\nFirst, an amount determined by us, as the general partner, of such capital transaction proceeds is allocated to OP unitholders in order to provide OP unitholders (together with any prior allocations of operating cash flow) with a cumulative preferred allocation on the unreturned capital contributions attributed to the OP unitholders in respect of\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nWe present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because we believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as an analytical tool. Some of these limitations are:\nSelf Storage Properties and Customer In-Place Leases\nOur financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those that impact our most critical accounting policies. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following are our most critical accounting policies.\nGain on sale of self storage properties was $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold one self storage property to an unrelated third party for gross proceeds of $6.5 million and during the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold two self storage properties to unrelated third parties for gross proceeds of $5.5 million.\n(iv)any other amounts received by us, which we allocate to the particular portfolio of properties.\nSelf storage properties are carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. When self storage properties are acquired, the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values. The purchase price is allocated to the individual properties based on the fair value determined using an income approach or a cash flow analysis using appropriate risk adjusted capitalization rates, which take into account the relative size, age, and location of the individual properties along with current and projected occupancy and relative rental rates or appraised values, if available. Tangible assets are allocated to land, buildings and related improvements, and furniture and equipment.\nInflation in the United States has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Although the impact of inflation has been relatively insignificant in recent years, it remains a factor in the U.S. economy and may increase the cost of acquiring or replacing self storage properties and related improvements, as well as real estate property taxes, employee salaries, wages and benefits, utilities, and other expenses. Because our tenant leases are month-to-month, we may be able to rapidly adjust our rental rates to minimize the adverse impact of any inflation which could mitigate our exposure to increases in costs and expenses resulting from inflation.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" as well as Item 1. \"Business,\" Item 1A. \"Risk Factors,\" and Item 2. \"Properties,\" respectively, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold 2,375,000 of our common shares and 1,785,680 of our Series A Preferred Shares through at the market offerings. The common shares were sold at an average offering price of $30.06 per share, resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $70.6 million after deducting compensation payable by us to such agents and offering expenses. The Series A Preferred Shares were sold at an average offering price of $24.84 per share, resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $43.6 million after deducting compensation payable by us to such agents and offering expenses.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, after receiving notices of redemption from certain OP unitholders, we elected to issue 581,001 common shares to such holders in exchange for 581,001 OP units in satisfaction of the operating partnership's redemption obligations.\nCash Distributions from our Operating Partnership\nResults of Operations\n\u2022EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures, contractual commitments or working capital needs;\n\nCash Flows\n(vii)reserves to meet anticipated operating expenditures, debt service or other liabilities, as determined by us.\n\u2022NOI is one of the primary measures used by our management and our PROs to evaluate the economic productivity of our properties, including our ability to lease our properties, increase pricing and occupancy and control our property operating expenses;\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nCash used in investing activities was $393.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $514.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The primary uses of cash for the year ended December 31, 2019 were for our acquisition of 69 self storage properties for cash consideration of $371.1 million, the acquisition of equity securities for $12.7 million, deposits for potential acquisitions of $4.4 million, capital expenditures of $20.6 million and the acquisition of the interest in a reinsurance company and related cash flows of $6.6 million, partially offset by distributions from unconsolidated real estate ventures of $11.5 million, $6.3 million of proceeds from the sale of one self storage property and $5.4 million of proceeds from the sale of equity securities. The primary uses of cash for the year ended December 31, 2018 were for our acquisition of 57 self storage properties and an expansion project for cash consideration of $313.7 million, investments in our unconsolidated real estate ventures of $165.6 million, deposits for acquisitions of $21.0 million and capital expenditures of $19.0 million, partially offset by $5.3 million of proceeds from the sale of two self storage properties.\nThe following table presents a summary of the capital expenditures for these categories, along with a reconciliation of the total for these categories to the capital expenditures reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\nOur consolidated NOI shown in the table above does not include our proportionate share of NOI for our unconsolidated real estate ventures. For additional information about our 2018 Joint Venture and 2016 Joint Venture see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\nThere are material limitations to using a non-GAAP measure such as NOI, including the difficulty associated with comparing results among more than one company and the inability to analyze certain significant items, including depreciation and interest expense, that directly affect our net income (loss). We compensate for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with our analysis of net income (loss). NOI should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP, such as total revenues, income from operations and net loss.\n(i)all receipts, including rents and other operating revenues;\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company issued 863,148 OP units upon conversion of 913,680 subordinated performance units and 13,475 DownREIT OP units upon conversion of 15,377 DownREIT subordinated performance units as further described under \"Subordinated Performance Units and DownREIT Subordinated Performance Units\" in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\nCapital expenditures totaled $20.6 million, $19.0 million and $14.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 respectively, we generally fund post-acquisition capital additions from cash provided by operating activities.\nEquity Transactions\nWe have a 2023 Term Loan Facility that matures in June 2023 and is separate from the credit facility in an aggregate amount of $175.0 million. As of December 31, 2019 the entire amount was outstanding under the 2023\nLiquidity Overview\nincluded in operating expenses, and as such, for comparability, we have presented $8.6 million of activity related to uncollectible accounts as a reduction to same store and non-same store property operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in property operating expenses resulted from a $13.6 million increase in non-same store property operating expenses that was primarily attributable to incremental property operating expenses of $9.3 million from 69 self storage properties acquired during 2019, and $4.6 million from 57 self storage properties acquired during 2018.\nNotwithstanding the two-year lock out period on conversions of subordinated performance units into OP units, if such subordinated performance units were convertible into OP units as of December 31, 2019, each subordinated performance unit would on average hypothetically convert into 1.48 OP units, or into an aggregate of approximately 22.8 million OP units. These amounts are based on historical financial information for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The hypothetical conversion is calculated by dividing the average cash available for distribution, or CAD, per subordinated performance unit by 110% of the CAD per OP unit over the same period. We anticipate that as our CAD grows over time, the conversion ratio will also grow, including to levels that may exceed this amount. The actual number of OP units into which such subordinated performance units will become convertible may vary significantly and will depend upon the applicable conversion penalty and the actual CAD to the OP units and the actual CAD to the converted subordinated performance units in the one-year period ending prior to conversion. We have also granted registration rights to those persons who will be eligible to receive common shares issuable upon exchange of OP units issued in our formation transactions and certain contribution transactions.\nOur PROs\nInterest expense increased $13.7 million, or 32.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to additional borrowings consisting of $155.0 million of additional term loan borrowings under the Company's credit facility on July 29, 2019 and $100.0 million of borrowings under the 2029 Term Loan Facility. Additionally, on August 30, 2019, our operating partnership issued the $150.0 million Senior Unsecured Notes in a private placement to certain accredited investors. The increase in interest expense from these additional borrowings was partially offset by lower outstanding borrowings under the Revolver.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our same store portfolio consisted of 439 self storage properties. See \"---Results of Operations\" above for the definition of our same store portfolio. The following table illustrates the changes in rental revenue, other property-related revenue, management fees and other revenue, property operating expenses, and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):\nCredit Facility and Term Loan Facilities\nOur long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of the repayment of debt, property acquisitions, and capital expenditures. We acquire properties through the use of cash, preferred units, OP units and subordinated performance units in our operating partnership or DownREIT partnerships. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity\nOur Structure\nTerm Loan Facility with an effective interest rate of 2.83%. We have an expansion option under the 2023 Term Loan Facility, which, if exercised in full, would provide for total borrowings in an aggregate amount of $400.0 million.\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA excludes equity-based compensation expense, which is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term incentive compensation package, although we exclude it as an expense when evaluating our ongoing operating performance for a particular period;\nWe define NOI as net income (loss), as determined under GAAP, plus general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, loss on early extinguishment of debt, equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated real estate ventures, acquisition costs, organizational and offering expenses, income tax expense, impairment of long-lived assets, losses on the sale of properties and non-operating expense and by subtracting management fees and other revenue, gains on sale of properties, debt forgiveness, and non-operating income. NOI is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n\u2022recurring capital expenditures, which represent the portion of capital expenditures that are deemed to replace the consumed portion of acquired capital assets and extend their useful life;\nInterest Expense\nWe compensate for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with our analysis of net income (loss). EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP, such as total revenues, income from operations, and net income (loss).\nWe believe NOI is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because:\nManagement fees and other revenue, which are primarily related to managing and operating the unconsolidated real estate ventures, were $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $8.4 million or 68.4%. This increase was primarily attributable to incremental fees earned from the 2018 Joint Venture following the acquisition of the Initial 2018 JV Portfolio (as defined in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8) in September 2018.", "item_7_tables": "Table 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the two-class method for the company's restricted common shares, the treasury stock method for certain unvested LTIP units, and includes the assumption of a hypothetical conversion of subordinated performance units and DownREIT subordinated performance units into OP units, even though such units may only be convertible into OP units (i) after a lock-out period and (ii) upon certain events or conditions. For additional information about the conversion of subordinated performance units, DownREIT subordinated performance units and LTIP units into OP units, see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. The computation of weighted average shares and units for FFO and Core FFO per share and unit includes all restricted common shares and LTIP units that participate in distributions and excludes all subordinated performance units and DownREIT subordinated performance units because their effect has been accounted for through the allocation of FFO to the related unitholders based on distributions

properties acquired in 2018 and 2019. Same-store revenues also increased 3.9% due to higher rental rates and occupancy. \n\n- Other property-related revenue increased 20.8% in 2019 compared to 2018, also driven by incremental revenue from acquired properties.\n\n- Property operating expenses increased 6.2% in 2019 compared to 2018. Incremental expenses from acquired properties were partially offset by the reclassification of bad debt expense to revenue starting in 2019 due to an accounting change.\n\n- Net operating income (NOI) increased 19.7% in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to incremental NOI from acquired properties. \n\n- General and administrative expenses increased 25.8% in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to increased management fees, costs for the property management platform, and salaries. \n\n- Equity in losses of unconsolidated real estate ventures was $5.0 million in 2019, up from $1.4 million in 2018, primarily due to losses from the 2018 Joint Venture.\n\n- Interest expense increased 32.2% in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to additional borrowings. \n\n- Net income increased $9.7 million or 17.2% in 2019 compared to 2018. Revenue growth outpaced increases in expenses.\n\n- Capital expenditures totaled $20.6 million in 2019, comprised of recurring, value enhancing, and acquisitions expenditures. \n\n- The company acquired 69 self storage properties in 2019 for $371.1 million.\n\nIn summary, the company experienced strong growth in 2019 driven by acquisitions, same-store growth, and third-party management revenue, partially offset by increases in expenses."}
