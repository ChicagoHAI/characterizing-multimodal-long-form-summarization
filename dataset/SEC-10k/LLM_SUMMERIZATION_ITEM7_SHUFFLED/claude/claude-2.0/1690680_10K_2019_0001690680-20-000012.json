MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of Newmark's financial condition and results of operations should be read together with Newmark's accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes, as well as the Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information\u201d relating to forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, (the Securities Act\u201d), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, (the Exchange Act\u201d), included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. When used herein, the terms Newmark Knight Frank,\u201d Newmark,\u201d the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d and our\u201d refer to Newmark and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nThis discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations and financial condition during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. We operate in one reportable segment, real estate services. This discussion is provided to increase the understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.\nOverview and Business Environment\nNewmark is a fast growing, full-service commercial real estate services business. We offer a diverse array of integrated services and products designed to meet the full needs of both real estate investors/owners and occupiers. Our investor/owner services and products include capital markets, which consists of investment sales, debt and structured finance and loan sales, agency leasing, property management, valuation and advisory, commercial real estate due diligence consulting and advisory services and government sponsored enterprise ( GSE\u201d) lending and loan servicing, mortgage broking and equity-raising. Our occupier services and products include tenant representation, real estate management technology systems, workplace and occupancy strategy, global corporate consulting services, project management, lease administration and facilities management. We enhance these services and products through innovative real estate technology solutions and data analytics that enable our clients to increase their efficiency and profits by optimizing their real estate portfolio. We have relationships with many of the world's largest commercial property owners, real estate developers and investors, as well as Fortune 500 and Forbes Global 2000 companies. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated revenues of $2.2 billion representing year-over-year growth of 8.3%.\nWe generate revenues from commissions on leasing and capital markets transactions, consulting and technology user fees, property and facility management fees, and mortgage origination and loan servicing fees.\nOur growth to date has been focused in North America. As of December 31, 2019, we have more than 5,600 employees, including more than 1,800 revenue-generating producers in over 137 offices in more than 105 cities. In addition, Newmark has licensed its name to 11 commercial real estate providers that operate out of 17 offices in certain locations where Newmark does not have its own offices.\nThe discussion of our financial results reflects only the business owned by us and does not include the results for Knight Frank or for the independently owned offices that use some variation of the Newmark name in their branding or marketing.\nOver the past several years, we expanded our capital markets capabilities through the strategic addition of many prolific, accomplished capital markets producers in key markets throughout the United States. We have access to many of the world's largest owners of commercial real estate, and this will drive growth throughout the life cycle of each real estate asset by allowing us to provide best-in-class agency leasing and property management during the ownership period. We also provide investment sales and arrange debt and equity financing to assist owners in maximizing the return on investment in each of their real estate assets. Specifically, with respect to multifamily assets, we are a leading GSE lender by loan origination volume and servicer with a servicing portfolio of $62.3 billion as of December 31, 2019 (of which 3.9% relates to special servicing). This servicing portfolio provides a steady stream of income over the life of the serviced loans. Additionally, we expect to see continued growth from our valuation and advisory and property management businesses, particularly in conjunction with our increasingly robust capital markets platform. In 2019, we did $81.3 billion of investment sales and debt transaction volume which was up $16.3 billion, or 25.1% over 2018.\nWe continue to invest in the business by adding high profile and talented producers and other revenue-generating professionals. Historically, newly hired commercial real estate producers tend to achieve dramatically higher productivity in their second and third years with our company, although we incur related expenses immediately. As our newly hired producers increase their production, we expect our commission revenue and earnings growth to accelerate, thus reflecting our operating leverage. Our pre-tax margins are impacted by the mix of revenues generated. For example, servicing revenues tend to have higher pre-tax margins than Newmark as a whole and margins from Gains from mortgage banking activities/originations, net\u201d tend to be lower as we retain rights to service loans over time. In addition, capital markets, which includes sales, commercial mortgage broking, and other real estate-related financial services, generally has larger transactions that occur with less frequency and visibility when compared with leasing advisory. Capital markets transactions tend to have higher pre-tax margins\nthan leasing advisory transactions, while leasing advisory revenues are generally more predictable than revenues from capital markets. Property and facilities management, along with certain of our other Global Corporate Services ( GCS\u201d) products, generally have the most predictable and steady revenues, although pre-tax earnings margins for property and facilities management are at the lower end of those for our business as a whole. When management services clients agree to give us exclusive rights to provide real estate services for their facilities or properties, it is for an extended period, which provides us with stable and foreseeable sources of revenues. Newmark's revenues are balanced between businesses that are relatively less predictable and contractual sources that are very predictable. Approximately 67% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 were generated by our most predictable and highly visible sources, including agency leasing, valuation, GCS, management services, loan servicing and tenant representation leasing business. The remaining 33% of revenues were generated by our more transactional investment sales, mortgage brokerage, and GSE lending platforms. Despite being more transactional, there are $2.1 trillion of mortgage maturities between 2020 and 2024 which we believe will support strong levels of mortgage brokerage and origination activities. Our debt volume increased by 34.7% year-on-year to $30.6 billion in 2019.\nIn the past several years, Newmark has acquired approximately 50 companies. We have identified opportunities to streamline our operations and complete the integration of these various businesses. We believe the result of these actions will generate in excess of $20 million of annualized savings by the end of 2020, of which $15 million were achieved in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nBerkeley Point Acquisition and Investment in Real Estate LP\nOn September 8, 2017, BGC Partners, Inc. ( BGC\u201d or BGC Partners\u201d) acquired, from Cantor Commercial Real Estate Company, LP ( CCRE\u201d), 100% of the equity of Berkeley Point Financial LLC (the Berkeley Point Acquisition\u201d). Berkeley Point Financial LLC ( Berkeley Point\u201d or BPF\u201d) is a leading commercial real estate finance company focused on the origination and sale of multifamily and other commercial real estate loans through government-sponsored and government-funded loan programs, as well as the servicing of commercial real estate loans. On December 13, 2017, in connection with the Separation from BGC, the assets and liabilities of Berkeley Point were transferred to Newmark. See Note 27 - Related Party Transactions\u201d to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nConcurrently with the acquisition of Berkeley Point Acquisition, on September 8, 2017 Newmark invested $100.0 million in a newly formed commercial real estate-related financial and investment business, CF Real Estate Finance Holdings, L.P. ( Real Estate LP\u201d), which is controlled and managed by Cantor (as defined below). Real Estate LP may conduct activities in any real estate related business or asset backed securities-related business or any extensions thereof and ancillary activities thereto. In addition, Real Estate LP may provide short-term loans to related parties from time to time when funds in excess of amounts needed for investment are available. Newmark's investment in Real Estate LP is accounted for under the equity method.\nSeparation, Initial Public Offering, and Spin-Off\nSeparation and Distribution and Related Agreements\nOn December 13, 2017, prior to the closing of Newmark's initial public offering ( IPO\u201d), BGC, BGC Holdings, L.P.

Newmark Class A shares began trading on December 15, 2017 on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol NMRK\u201d. In addition, Newmark granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 3 million shares of Newmark Class A common stock at the IPO price, less underwriting discounts and commissions. On December 26, 2017, the underwriters of the IPO exercised in full their overallotment option to purchase an additional 3 million shares of Newmark Class A common stock from Newmark at the IPO price, less underwriting discounts and commission. As a result, Newmark received aggregate net proceeds of $295.4 million from the IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. See Note 27 - Related Party Transactions\u201d to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nBGC's Investment in Newmark Holdings\nOn March 7, 2018, BGC Partners and its operating subsidiaries purchased 16.6 million newly issued exchangeable limited partnership units (the Newmark Units\u201d) of Newmark Holdings for $242.0 million (the Investment by BGC in Newmark Holdings\u201d). See Note 27 - Related Party Transactions\u201d to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nDebt Repayment and Credit Agreements\nAs of January 1, 2018, Newmark had an outstanding balance of $270.7 million under a committed unsecured senior term loan credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders. The term loan credit agreement provided for loans of up to $575.0 million (the Term Loan\u201d). Newmark used the proceeds of the Investment in Newmark Holdings plus cash on hand to repay in full the Term Loan.\nAs of January 1, 2018, Newmark had an outstanding balance of $40.0 million under an unsecured senior credit agreement, which was amended and restated on March 19, 2018 ( Intercompany Credit Agreement\u201d). Through the year ended December 31, 2018, Newmark borrowed an additional $230.0 million and used these proceeds plus cash on hand to fund its restricted cash account pledged for the benefit of the Federal National Mortgage Association ( Fannie Mae\u201d). On September 4, 2018, Newmark borrowed $112.5 million in order to repay a promissory note payable to BGC of $112.5 million (the 2042 Promissory Note\u201d). On October 4, 2018, Newmark withdrew $252.0 million of cash on hand that was in excess of the minimum balance required to be pledged for the benefit of Fannie Mae to repay $252.0 million towards the outstanding balance of the Intercompany Credit Agreement. The remaining balance of $130.5 million was repaid with the proceeds of the 6.125% Senior Notes (as defined below).\nAs of January 1, 2018, Newmark had an outstanding balance of $400.0 million under a committed unsecured senior revolving credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A, as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders (the Converted Term Loan\u201d).

The 6.125% Senior Notes are general senior unsecured obligations of Newmark. The 6.125% Senior Notes, which were priced on November 1, 2018 at 98.937% to yield 6.375%, were offered and sold by Newmark in a private offering exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act. Newmark received net proceeds of $537.6 million, net of debt issue costs and debt discount. The 6.125% Senior Notes bear an interest rate of 6.125% per annum, payable on each May 15 and November 15, beginning on May 15, 2019 and will mature on November 15, 2023. Newmark used the net proceeds to repay the remaining balance of the Converted Term Loan of $133.9 million, the balance of\nthe Intercompany Credit Agreement of $130.5 million, and a portion of the 2019 Promissory Note (as defined below). The 6.125% Senior Notes were subsequently exchanged for notes with substantially similar terms that were registered under the Securities Act. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the carrying amount of the 6.125% Senior Notes was $540.4 million and $537.9 million, respectively.\nAs of January 1, 2018, Newmark had an outstanding balance of $300.0 million principal amount promissory note payable to BGC U.S. OpCo (the 2019 Promissory Note\u201d). On November 23, 2018, Newmark OpCo repaid the $300.0 million outstanding principal amount under the 2019 Promissory Note, primarily using proceeds from the sale of its 6.125% Senior Notes. Upon repayment of the 2019 Promissory Note, Newmark had no further debt obligations owed to or guaranteed by BGC, which was one of the requirements for the Spin-Off to be tax-free.\nOn November 28, 2018, Newmark entered into a credit agreement by and among Newmark, the several financial institutions from time to time party thereto, as Lenders, and Bank of America N.A., as administrative agent (the Credit Agreement\u201d). The Credit Agreement provides for a $250.0 million three-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility\u201d). As of December 31, 2019, there was $50.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facility.\nOn February 26, 2020, Newmark entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement (the Amended Credit Agreement\u201d), increasing the size of the Credit Facility to $425.0 million ( the Amended Credit Facility\u201d) and extending the maturity date to February 26, 2023. The interest rate on the Amended Credit Facility is LIBOR plus 1.75% per annum, subject to a pricing grid linked to Newmark's credit ratings from Standard & Poor's and Fitch.\nOn November 30, 2018, Newmark entered into an unsecured credit agreement (the Cantor Credit Agreement\u201d) with Cantor. The Cantor Credit Agreement provides for each party to issue loans to the other party in the lender's discretion. Pursuant to the Cantor Credit Agreement, the parties and their respective subsidiaries (with respect to CFLP, other than BGC and its subsidiaries) may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $250.0 million from each other from time to time at an interest rate which is the higher of Cantor's or the Company's short-term borrowing rate then in effect, plus 1.0%.\nCredit Rating\nNewmark has a stand-alone BBB- stable credit rating from Fitch Ratings, Inc. and Kroll Bond Rating Agency, as well as a BB+ stable rating from Standard & Poor's.\nThe Spin-Off\nOn November 30, 2018, BGC completed the Spin-Off to its stockholders of all of the shares of the Newmark common stock owned by BGC as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Spin-Off, with shares of Newmark Class A common stock distributed to the holders of shares of BGC Class A common stock (including directors and executive officers of BGC Partners) of record as of the close of business on November 23, 2018 (the Record Date\u201d), and shares of Newmark Class B common stock distributed to the holders of shares of BGC's Class B common stock (consisting of Cantor and CF Group Management, Inc. ( CFGM\u201d) of record as of the close of business on the Record Date).\nBased on the number of shares of BGC common stock outstanding as of the close of business on the Record Date, BGC's stockholders as of the Record Date received in the Spin-Off 0.463895 of a share of Newmark Class A common stock for each share of BGC Class A common stock held as of the Record Date, and 0.463895 of a share of Newmark Class B common stock for each share of BGC Class B common stock held as of the Record Date. BGC Partners stockholders received cash in lieu of any fraction of a share of Newmark common stock that they otherwise would have received in the Spin-Off.\nPrior to and in connection with the Spin-Off, 14.8 million Newmark Units held by BGC were exchanged into 9.4 million shares of Newmark Class A common stock and 5.4 million shares of Newmark Class B common stock, and 7.0 million Newmark OpCo Units held by BGC were exchanged into 6.9 million shares of Newmark Class A common stock. These Newmark Class A and Class B shares of common stock were included in the Spin-Off to BGC's stockholders.\nIn the aggregate, BGC distributed 131,886,409 shares of our Class A common stock and 21,285,537 shares of our Class B common stock to BGC's stockholders in the Spin-Off. These shares of our common stock collectively represented approximately 94% of the total voting power of our outstanding common stock and approximately 87% of the total economics of our outstanding common stock in each case as of the Distribution Date.\nOn November 30, 2018, BGC Partners also caused its subsidiary, BGC Holdings, to distribute pro rata (the BGC Holdings distribution\u201d) all of the 1,458,931 exchangeable limited partnership units of Newmark Holdings held by BGC Holdings immediately prior to the effective time of the BGC Holdings distribution to its limited partners entitled to receive distributions on their BGC Holdings units (including Cantor and executive officers of BGC) who were holders of record of such units as of the Record Date. The Newmark Holdings units distributed to BGC Holdings partners in the BGC Holdings distribution are exchangeable for shares of Newmark Class A common stock, and in the case of the 449,917 Newmark Holdings units received by Cantor also into shares of Newmark Class B common stock, at the applicable exchange ratio (subject to\nadjustment). As of December 31, 2019, the exchange ratio was 0.9400 shares of Newmark common stock per Newmark Holdings unit.\nFollowing the Spin-Off and the BGC Holdings distribution, BGC Partners ceased to be our controlling stockholder, and BGC and its subsidiaries no longer held any shares of our common stock or other equity interests in us or our subsidiaries. Therefore, BGC no longer consolidates Newmark with its financial results subsequent to the Spin-Off. Cantor continues to control Newmark and its subsidiaries following the Spin-Off and the BGC Holdings distribution.\nNasdaq Monetization Transactions\nOn June 28, 2013, BGC sold certain assets of its on-the-run, electronic benchmark U.S. Treasury platform ( eSpeed\u201d) to Nasdaq. The total consideration received in the transaction included $750.0 million in cash paid upon closing and an Earn-out of up to 14,883,705 shares of Nasdaq common stock to be paid ratably over 15 years, provided that Nasdaq, as a whole, produces at least $25.0 million in consolidated gross revenues each year. Nasdaq generated gross revenues of approximately $4.3 billion in 2019. The remaining rights under the Nasdaq Earn-out were transferred to Newmark on September 28, 2017. See Note 7 - Marketable Securities\u201d to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nExchangeable Preferred Partnership Units and Forward Contracts\nOn June 18, 2018, Newmark's principal operating subsidiary, Newmark OpCo, issued $175.0 million of exchangeable preferred partnership units ( EPUs\u201d) in a private transaction to the Royal Bank of Canada ( RBC\u201d). Newmark received $152.9 million of cash with respect to this transaction.\nOn September 26, 2018, Newmark entered into a second agreement to issue $150.0 million of additional EPUs to RBC, similar to the June 18, 2018 transaction (together the Newmark OpCo Preferred Investment\u201d). Newmark received $113.2 million of cash with respect to this transaction.\nThe EPUs were issued in four tranches and are separately convertible by either RBC or Newmark into a fixed number of shares of Newmark Class A common stock, subject to a revenue hurdle in each of the fourth quarters of 2019 through 2022 for each of the respective four tranches. The ability to convert the EPUs into Newmark Class A common stock is subject to the SPV's option to settle the postpaid forward contracts as described below. As the EPUs represent equity ownership of a consolidated subsidiary of Newmark, they have been included in Noncontrolling interests\u201d on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of changes in equity. The EPUs are entitled to a preferred payable-in-kind dividend, which is recorded as accretion to the carrying amount of the EPUs through Retained earnings\u201d on our accompanying consolidated statements of changes in equity and are reductions to Net income (loss) available to common stockholders\u201d for the purpose of calculating earnings per share.\nContemporaneously with the issuance of the EPUs, the special purpose vehicle (the SPV\u201d) that is a consolidated subsidiary of Newmark entered into four variable postpaid forward contracts with RBC (together, the Nasdaq Forwards\u201d). The SPV is an indirect subsidiary of Newmark whose sole assets are the Nasdaq Earn-outs for 2019 through 2022. The Nasdaq Forwards provide the SPV the option to settle using up to 992,247 shares of Nasdaq common stock, to be received by the SPV pursuant to the Nasdaq Earn-out (See Note 7 - Marketable Securities\u201d to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), or Newmark Class A common stock, in exchange for either cash or redemption of the EPUs, notice of which must be provided to RBC prior to November 1 of each year from 2019 through 2022.\nIn September 2019, the SPV notified RBC of its decision to settle the first variable postpaid forward contract using the Nasdaq common stock the SPV received in November 2019 in exchange for the first tranche of the EPUs, which resulted in a payable to RBC that was settled upon receipt of Nasdaq earn-out shares. The fair value of the Nasdaq common stock that Newmark received was $98.6 million. As a result of Newmark's settlement election, Newmark reclassified $93.5 million of EPUs from \"Noncontrolling interest\" to \"Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities\" on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. On December 2, 2019, Newmark settled the first variable postpaid forward contract with 898,685 Nasdaq common stock shares, with a fair value of $93.5 million and Newmark retained 93,562 Nasdaq common stock shares. The fair value of the Nasdaq common stock held by Newmark, as of December 31, 2019 was $36.8 million and is included in Marketable securities\u201d on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nTransfer of Employees to Newmark and Other Related Party Transactions\nIn connection with the expansion of our mortgage brokerage and lending activities, Newmark has entered into an agreement with Cantor pursuant to which five former employees of its affiliate, CCRE, have transferred to Newmark, effective as of May 1, 2018. In connection with this transfer of employees, Cantor paid $6.9 million to Newmark in October 2018 and Newmark Holdings issued $6.7 million of limited partnership units and $0.2 million of cash in the form of a cash distribution agreement to the employees. In addition, Newmark Holdings issued $2.2 million of Newmark Holdings partnership units with a\ncapital account and $0.5 million of limited partnership units in exchange for the cash payment from Cantor to Newmark of $2.2 million. In consideration for the Cantor payment, Newmark has agreed to return up to a maximum of $3.3 million to Cantor based on the employees' production during their first two years of employment with Newmark. As of December 31, 2019, Newmark has $2.6 million included in Payables to related parties\u201d on the consolidated balance sheets, to be returned to Cantor related to this transaction. Newmark has agreed to allow certain of these employees to continue to provide consulting services to Cantor in exchange for a forgivable loan which was directly paid by Cantor to these employees.\nIn November 2018, the Audit Committee authorized Newmark to enter into an engagement agreement with CF&Co. and its affiliates to act as financial advisor in connection with one or more third-party business combination transactions as requested by Newmark on behalf of its affiliates from time to time on specified terms, conditions and fees.\nIn February 2019, the Audit Committee of the Company authorized Newmark and its subsidiaries to originate and service GSE loans to Cantor and its affiliates (other than BGC) and service loans originated by Cantor and its affiliates (other than BGC) on prices, rates and terms no less favorable to Newmark and its subsidiaries than those charged by third parties. The authorization is subject to certain terms and conditions, including but not limited to: (i) a maximum amount up to $100.0 million per loan, (ii) a $250.0 million limit on loans that have not yet been acquired or sold to a GSE at any given time, and (iii) a separate $250.0 million limit on originated Fannie Mae loans outstanding to Cantor at any given time.\nOn July 22, 2019, Cantor Commercial Real Estate Lending, L.P. ( CCRE Lending\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Real Estate LP, made a $146.6 million commercial real estate loan (the Loan\u201d) to a single-purpose company (the Borrower\u201d) in which Barry Gosin, Newmark's Chief Executive Officer, owns a 19% interest. The Loan is secured by the Borrower's interest in property in Pennsylvania that is subject to a ground lease. While CCRE Lending initially provided the full loan amount, on August 16, 2019, a third-party bank purchased approximately 80% of the Loan value from CCRE Lending, with CCRE Lending retaining approximately 20%. The Loan matures on August 6, 2029, and is payable monthly at a fixed interest rate of 4.38% per annum. Newmark provided certain commercial loan brokerage services to the Borrower in the ordinary course of its business, and the Borrower paid Newmark a fee, as the broker of the Loan, of $0.7 million. The Newmark Audit Committee approved the commercial loan brokerage services and the related fee amount received.\nPre-IPO Related Party Items\nIn December 2017, prior to our Separation and IPO, all intercompany arrangements and agreements that were previously approved by the Audit Committee of BGC Partners with respect to BGC Partners and its subsidiaries and Cantor and its subsidiaries were also approved by our Board of Directors with respect to the relationships between us and our subsidiaries and Cantor and its subsidiaries following our IPO on the terms and conditions approved by the BGC Audit Committee during such time that our business was owned by BGC Partners. These arrangements include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) an authorization to provide Cantor real estate and related services, including real estate advice, brokerage, property or facilities management, appraisals and valuations and other services; (ii) an authorization to enter into brokerage and similar agreements with respect to the provision of ordinary course brokerage services in circumstances in which such entities customarily provide brokerage services to third-party customers; (iii) an authorization to enter into agreements with Cantor and/or its affiliates, to provide services, including finding and reviewing suitable acquisition or partner candidates, structuring transactions and negotiating and due diligence services in connection with acquisitions and other business strategies in commercial real estate and other businesses from time to time; and (iv) an arrangement to jointly manage exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates. Please see the section entitled Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\u201d in BGC Partners' Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A for its 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders filed on April 29, 2019 for a description of these and other approved arrangements.\nGrowth Drivers\nThe key drivers of revenue growth for U.S. commercial real estate services companies include the overall health of the U.S. economy, institutional ownership of commercial real estate as an investible asset class, and the ability to attract and retain talent. In addition, growth in our capital markets business is driven by the availability of credit to purchasers of and investors in commercial real estate. In our multifamily business, delayed marriages, an aging population and less home ownership are driving increased demand for new apartments, with an estimated 4.6 million needed by 2030, according to a 2017 study commissioned by the National Multifamily Housing Council and the National Apartment Association. This should continue to drive investment sales, GSE multifamily lending and other mortgage brokerage and growth in our servicing portfolio for the foreseeable future. According to RealPage, developers are expected to deliver 370 thousand new apartments in 2020, up 50% from 247 thousand in 2019.\nOur origination business is impacted by the lending caps imposed by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (the FHFA\u201d). On September 13, 2019, the FHFA revised its industry-wide multifamily loan purchase caps to $200.0 billion combined for the five-quarter period from the fourth quarter of 2019 to the fourth quarter of 2020. These caps on an annualized basis exceed total 2019 GSE volume of $148.5 billion and provide visibility through the end of 2020. Of the $200.0 billion, 37.5% must be loans in the affordable and underserved market segments, as well as loans that finance water and energy efficiency improvements.\nEconomic Growth in the United States\nThe U.S. economy expanded by 2.3% during 2019, according to a preliminary estimate from the U.S. Department of Commerce. This growth compares with an increase of 2.9% during 2018. The consensus is for U.S. gross domestic product to expand by 1.8% in 2020 and 1.9% in 2021, according to a recent Bloomberg survey of economists. This moderate pace of growth should help keep interest rates and inflation low by historical standards.\nAccording to a preliminary report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employers added a monthly average of approximately 175 thousand net new payroll jobs during 2019, which was below the seasonally adjusted average of 193 thousand per month in 2018.\nThe ten-year Treasury yield declined by approximately 77 basis points to 1.92% as of December 31, 2019 versus the year-earlier date. Ten-year Treasury yields have remained well below their 50-year average of approximately 6.32% due to market expectations that the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC\u201d) will lower the federal funds rate over the next year in addition to muted long-term inflation expectations. On October 30, 2019, the FOMC reduced the target range for the federal funds rate to between 1.50% and 1.75%.\nInterest rates are also relatively low because of even lower or negative benchmark government interest rates in much of the rest of the developed world, which makes U.S. government bonds relatively more attractive.\nSteady economic growth and historically low interest rates have helped push vacancy rates down for the office, apartment, and industrial markets over the current economic expansion, which began in July 2009. Construction activity, while increasing, remains low compared with prior expansion cycles and low relative to demand and absorption, which means that property leasing markets continue to tighten. Overall, demand for commercial real estate remains strong. U.S. office asking rates increased by 1.3% year-over-year, according to Newmark Research.\nThe following key trends drove the commercial real estate market during 2019:\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Sustained U.S. employment growth and rising home values have fueled the economy and generated demand for commercial real estate;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 216: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Technology, professional and business services and healthcare continued to power demand for office space;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 217: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>E-commerce and supply-chain optimization has pushed industrial absorption to 39 consecutive quarters of positive net absorption, reflecting tenant and owner-user demand for warehouses and distribution centers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Apartment rents benefited from sustained job growth and underlying demographic trends towards apartment living among two key age groups: millennials and baby boomers; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Continued corporate employment growth, combined with increased leisure travel, generated demand for hotel room-nights.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Rising inflation and interest rates, which are byproducts of faster economic growth, could deliver a mixed outcome: potentially higher interest rates could put upward pressure on cap rates, but stronger rent growth and sustained investor demand could support higher property values and income growth.\nMarket Statistics\nAccording to Real Capital Analytics ( RCA\u201d), prices for commercial real estate were up by approximately 8% year-over-year for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year, overall U.S. commercial real estate notional sales volumes decreased by approximately 2%. In comparison, our investment sales volumes increased 19.9% year-over-year in 2019. According to a January 2020 Mortgage Bankers Association ( MBA\u201d) forecast, originations of commercial/multifamily loans of all types are projected to increase approximately 9% in terms of dollar volume for each of the years ending December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020. Our mortgage brokerage volumes were up 47.6% year-over-year in 2019 and our total debt volumes were up 34.7% to over $30 billion in 2019.\nNewmark's loan origination volumes are driven more by the GSE multifamily financing volumes than the activity level of the overall commercial mortgage market. Overall industry GSE multifamily origination volumes increased by approximately 4% year-over-year in 2019. In comparison, Newmark's combined notional volumes across GSE and FHA multifamily loan originations increased by 16.1% year-over-year. The GSE multifamily agency volume statistics for the\nindustry are based on when loans are sold and/or securitized, and typically lag those reported by Newmark and its competitors by 30 to 45 days.\nAccording to NKF Research, the average vacancy rate for office improved 20 basis points year-over-year to 12.9%, industrial increased slightly to 5.2%, while retail rose 40 basis points compared with the year earlier. Against this backdrop, revenues from our leasing and other commissions business increased by 4.6% year-over-year in 2019.\nRegulatory Environment\nSee Business-Regulation\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information related to our regulatory environment.\nLiquidity\nSee Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d herein for information related to our liquidity and capital resources.\nHiring and Acquisitions\nKey drivers of our revenue are producer headcount and average revenue per producer. We believe that our strong technology platform and equity and partnership structure have enabled us to use both acquisitions and recruiting to profitably increase our front-office revenue and revenue per producer, over time.\nWe have invested significantly to capitalize on the current business environment through acquisitions, technology spending and the hiring of new producers, salespeople, managers and other front-office personnel. The business climate for these acquisitions has been competitive, and it is expected that these conditions will persist for the foreseeable future. We have been able to attract businesses and producers, salespeople, managers and other front-office personnel to our platform as we believe they recognize that we have the scale, technology, experience and expertise to succeed in the current business environment. See Item 1 - Business-Our History\u201d for a description of our acquisitions since 2017.\nDuring 2019, our headcount grew 8%. During 2018 and 2019 we hired over 100 top producers to the platform with average annual production in excess of $2.0 million. Based on their strong track record of revenue generation, we expect these new hires will help us achieve our growth and productivity targets over the coming years. As we continue to generate a higher percentage of our revenues from recurring businesses, we no longer plan to highlight our broker productivity metric beginning in 2020. This is consistent with our full service peers.\nIn April 2019, we acquired MLG Commercial, a leading commercial real estate company offering both brokerage and property management services in Wisconsin.\nIn June 2019, we completed the acquisition of ACRES, a commercial brokerage and management firm headquartered in Utah. ACRES operates offices in Salt Lake City, Utah; Boise, Idaho; and Reno, Nevada.\nIn December 2019, we completed the acquisition of Harper Dennis Hobbs Holdings Limited, a tenant-focused real estate advisory services firm, based in London.\nFinancial Overview\nRevenues\nWe derive revenues from the following general four sources:\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Leasing and Other Commissions. We offer a diverse range of commercial real estate brokerage and advisory services, including tenant and agency representation, which includes comprehensive lease negotiations, strategic planning, site selection, lease auditing, and other financial and market analysis.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 221: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Capital Markets. Our real estate capital markets business specializes in the arrangement of acquisitions and dispositions of commercial properties, as well as providing other financial services, including the arrangement of debt and equity financing, and loan sale advisory.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 222: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Gains from Mortgage Banking Activities/Originations, Net. Gains from mortgage banking activities/originations are derived from the origination of loans with borrowers and the sale of those loans to investors.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 223: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Management Services, Servicing Fees and Other. We provide commercial services to tenants and landlords. In this business, we provide property and facilities management services along with project management, valuation and appraisal services and other consulting services, as well as technology, to customers who may also utilize our commercial real estate brokerage services. Servicing fees are derived from the servicing of loans originated by us as well as loans originated by third parties.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFees are generally earned when a lease is signed. In many cases, landlords are responsible for paying the fees. In capital markets, fees are earned and recognized when the sale of a property closes, and title passes from seller to buyer for investment sales and when debt or equity is funded to a vehicle for debt and equity transactions. Gains from mortgage banking activities/originations, net are recognized when a derivative asset is recorded upon the commitment to originate a loan with a borrower and sell the loan to an investor. The derivative is recorded at fair value and includes loan origination fees, sales premiums and the estimated fair value of the expected net servicing cash flows. Gains from mortgage banking activities/originations, net are recognized net of related fees and commissions to affiliates or third-party brokers. For loans we broker, revenues are recognized when the loan is closed. Servicing fees are recognized on an accrual basis over the lives of the related mortgage loans. We typically receive monthly management fees based upon a percentage of monthly rental income generated from the property under management, or in some cases, the greater of such percentage or a minimum agreed upon fee. We are often reimbursed for our administrative and payroll costs, as well as certain out-of-pocket expenses, directly attributable to properties under management. We follow accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or U.S. GAAP\u201d, which provides guidance when accounting for reimbursements from clients and when accounting for certain contingent events for Leasing and Capital Markets transactions. See Note 3 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion.\nExpenses\nCompensation and Employee Benefits\nThe majority of our operating costs consist of cash and non-cash compensation expenses, which include base salaries, producer commissions based on production, forgivable loans for term contracts, discretionary and other bonuses and all related employee benefits and taxes. Our employees consist of commissioned producers, executives and other administrative support. Our producers are largely compensated based on the revenue they generate for the firm, keeping these costs variable in nature.\nAs part of our compensation plans, certain employees have been granted limited partnership units in Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings, which generally receive quarterly allocations of net income and are generally contingent upon services being provided by the unit holders. Certain Newmark employees also hold non-distribution earnings units (e.g. NPSUs and NREUs, collectively N Units\u201d) that do not participate in quarterly partnership distributions and are not allocated any items of profit or loss. These N Units vest into distribution earnings units over a 4-year period. As prescribed in U.S. GAAP guidance, the quarterly allocations of net income on such limited partnership units are reflected as a component of compensation expense under Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations. During 2019, Newmark simplified its compensation structure when hiring new personnel by issuing restricted stock units in lieu of limited partnership units. Newmark continues to monitor its compensation policy and make changes where necessary to attract industry leading producers to Newmark.\nNewmark granted conversion rights on outstanding limited partnership units in Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings to Newmark employees to convert the limited partnership units to a capital balance within Newmark Holdings or BGC Holdings. Generally, HDUs are not considered share-equivalent limited partnership units and are not in the fully diluted share count.\nCertain of these limited partnership units entitle the holders to receive post-termination payments. These limited partnership units are accounted for as post-termination liability awards under U.S. GAAP guidance, which requires that we record an expense for such awards based on the change in value at each reporting period and include the expense in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations as part of Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d. The liability for limited partnership units with a post-termination payout amount is included in Other long-term liabilities\u201d on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nCertain limited partnership units are granted exchangeability into Class A common stock or may be redeemed in connection with the grant of shares of Class A common stock. At the time exchangeability is granted, or the shares are issued, Newmark recognizes an expense based on the fair value of the award on that date, which is included in Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nOur employees have been awarded preferred partnership units ( Preferred Units\u201d) in Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings. Each quarter, the net profits of Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings are allocated to such units at a rate of either 0.6875% (which is 2.75% per calendar year) or such other amount as set forth in the award documentation (the Preferred Distribution\u201d), which is deducted before the calculation and distribution of the quarterly partnership distribution for the remaining partnership units in Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings, respectively. The Preferred Units are not entitled to participate in partnership distributions other than with respect to the Preferred Distribution. Preferred Units may not be made exchangeable into our Class A common stock and are only entitled to the Preferred Distribution, and accordingly they are not\nincluded in our fully diluted share count. The quarterly allocations of net income on Preferred Units are also reflected in compensation expense under Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations. After deduction of the Preferred Distribution, the remaining partnership units generally receive quarterly allocation of net income based on their weighted-average pro rata share of economic ownership of the operating subsidiaries. In addition, Preferred Units are granted in connection with the grant of certain limited partnership units, such as PSUs, that may be granted exchangeability to cover the withholding taxes owed by the unit holder upon such exchange. This is an acceptable alternative to the common practice among public companies of issuing the gross amount of shares to employees, subject to cashless withholding of shares to pay applicable withholding taxes.\nWe have entered into various agreements with certain of our employees and partners whereby these individuals receive loans, which may be either wholly or in part repaid from the distribution earnings that the individual receives on their limited partnership interests in BGC Holdings and Newmark Holdings. The forgivable portion of these loans is recognized as compensation expense over the life of the loan.\nFrom time to time, we may also enter into agreements with employees and partners to grant bonus and salary advances or other types of loans. These advances and loans are repayable in the timeframes outlined in the underlying agreements. In addition, we also enter into deferred compensation agreements with employees providing services to us. The costs associated with such plans are generally amortized over the period in which they vest. (See Note 30 - Compensation\u201d and Note 31 - Commitment and Contingencies\u201d, to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nOther Operating Expenses\nWe have various other operating expenses. We incur leasing, equipment and maintenance expenses. We also incur selling and promotion expenses, which include entertainment, marketing and travel-related expenses. We incur communication expenses, professional and consulting fees for legal, audit and other special projects, and interest expense related to short-term operational funding needs, and notes payable and collateralized borrowings.\nWe pay fees to BGC Partners and/or Cantor for performing certain administrative and other support, including charges for occupancy of office space, utilization of fixed assets and accounting, operations, human resources, legal services and technology infrastructure support. Management believes that these charges are a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services rendered. However, the expenses for these services are not necessarily indicative of the expenses that would have been incurred if we had not obtained these services from BGC Partners or Cantor. In addition, these charges may not reflect the costs of services we may receive from BGC Partners or Cantor in the future.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net is comprised of the gains associated with the Earn-out shares related to the Nasdaq transaction and the movements related to the impact of any unrealized non-cash mark-to-market gains or losses related to the Nasdaq Forwards. Additionally, other income includes gains (losses) on equity method investments which represent our pro rata share of the net gains (losses) on investments over which we have significant influence but which we do not control, and the mark-to-market gains or losses on the non-marketable investments accounted for pursuant to the measurement alternative under Accounting Standards Update 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe incur income tax expenses based on the location, legal structure, and jurisdictional taxing authorities of each of our subsidiaries. Certain of the Company's entities are taxed as U.S. partnerships and are subject to the Unincorporated Business Tax (which we refer to as UBT\u201d) in New York City. U.S. federal and state income tax liability or benefit related to the partnership income or loss, with the exception of UBT, rests with the partners (See Note 2 - Limited Partnership Interests in Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings\u201d, to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.) rather than the partnership entity. Our accompanying consolidated financial statements include U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on the Company's allocable share of the U.S. results of operations. Outside of the U.S., we operate principally through subsidiary corporations subject to local income taxes.\nFinancial Highlights\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, Newmark's total revenues were $2.2 billion, an 8.3% increase, as compared to 2018. For the full year 2019, all major business lines were up as compared with 2018. More than 85% of our overall revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2019 was organic. Newmark continued to gain market share in 2019, as evidenced by its volume growth of 20% in investment sales, 48% in mortgage brokerage, and 16% in GSE originations. Total investment sales and debt increased by $16.0 billion, or 25.0% to $81.0 billion in 2019 as compared to 2018.\nImpact of Adopting Revenue Recognition Guidance\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606\u201d), which provides accounting guidance on the recognition of revenues from contracts with customers and impacts the presentation of certain revenues and expenses in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Newmark elected to adopt ASC 606 using a modified retrospective approach with regard to contracts that were not completed as of December 31, 2017, and prospectively from January 1, 2018 onward. Due to the adoption of ASC 606, for all periods from the first quarter of 2018 onward, Newmark did not and will not record revenues or earnings related to Leasing and other commissions\u201d with respect to contingent revenue expected to be received in future periods as of December 31, 2017, in relation to contracts signed prior to January 1, 2018, for which services have already been completed. Instead, Newmark recorded this contingent revenue and related commission payments on the balance sheet on January 1, 2018, with a corresponding pre-tax improvement of $22.7 million and Newmark recognized an increase of $16.5 million and $2.3 million to beginning retained earnings and noncontrolling interests, respectively, as a cumulative effect of adoption of an accounting change.\nSee Note 13 - Revenues from Contracts with Customers\u201d to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for further information.\nImpact of Adopting Lease Guidance\nOn January 1, 2019, Newmark adopted ASC 842 Leases ( ASC 842\u201d), which provides guidance on the accounting and disclosure for accounting for leases. Newmark has elected the optional transition method, and pursuant to this transition method, financial information will not be updated and the disclosures required under the new standard will not be provided for dates and periods prior to January 1, 2019. Newmark has elected the package of practical expedients,\u201d which permits Newmark not to reassess under the new standard its prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. Newmark has elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify, and has elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all leases other than real estate leases.\nThe adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019 resulted in the recognition of Right-of-use ( ROU\u201d) assets of approximately $178.8 million and ROU liabilities of approximately $226.7 million, with no effect on beginning retained earnings.\nThe adoption of the new guidance did not have a significant impact on our accompanying consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statements of changes in equity, and consolidated statements of cash flows.\nSee Note 3 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 18 - Leases\u201d to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for further information.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our

December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018\nRevenues\nLeasing and Other Commissions\nLeasing and other commission revenues increased by $37.3 million, or 4.6%, to $854.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was largely due to organic growth.\nCapital Markets\nCapital markets revenue increased by $72.4 million, or 15.4%, to $541.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was driven by a 47.6% increase in mortgage brokerage\nvolume and a 19.9% increase in investment sales volume, both of which significantly outpaced overall industry growth volumes in the U.S.\nGains from Mortgage Banking Activities/Originations, Net\nGains from mortgage banking activities, net increased by $15.8 million, or 8.7%, to $198.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in GSE loan origination volume of $1.4 billion, or 16.1%, to $9.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. As with other multifamily agency lenders, Newmark's mix of originations, and therefore revenues, can vary depending on the size of loans, as well by the categories of loans with respect to the FHA, Freddie Mac, and different Fannie Mae structures.\nA portion of our gains from mortgage banking activities, net, relate to non-cash gains attributable to OMSRs. We recognize OMSR gains equal to the fair value of servicing rights retained on mortgage loans originated and sold. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recognized $109.2 million and $103.2 million of non-cash gains, respectively, related to OMSRs. As with originations, OMSR gains are also impacted by the product mix.\nManagement Services, Servicing Fees and Other\nManagement services, servicing fees and other revenue increased $45.0 million, or 7.8%, to $624.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Valuation and advisory increased $21.4 million, or 31.1%. Servicing fees increased $11.1 million (which includes a $4.1 million increase in interest income on escrow balances and a $3.5 million increase in yield maintenance fees), and interest income on loans held for sale increased $2.0 million, which was largely offset by additional interest expense on the warehouse facilities collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises.\nExpenses\nCompensation and Employee Benefits\nCompensation and employee benefits expense increased by $114.0 million, or 9.8%, to $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The main driver of this increase was Newmark's continued hiring of leading industry professionals.\nEquity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\nEquity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs increased by $34.2 million, or 15.2%, to $258.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily driven by an increase of $32.9 million in equity amortization.\nOperating, Administrative and Other\nOperating, administrative and other expenses increased $30.1 million, or 9.1%, to $361.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily driven by increases in selling and promotional and other expenses associated with acquisitions and new hires, an increase in interest expense on the warehouse facilities collateralized by GSEs of $3.8 million, which is partially offset by the increase in interest income on Loans held for sale, at fair value.\nFees to Related Parties\nFees to related parties decreased by $1.1 million, or 4.3%, to $25.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $33.4 million, or 34.2%, to $131.1 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was due to a $23.1 million increase in mortgage servicing rights amortization and a $9.0 million increase in fixed asset depreciation, which was due to a $5.0 million asset impairment related to Newmark's restructuring plan.\nBecause Newmark recognizes OMSR gains equal to the fair value of servicing rights retained on mortgage loans originated and sold, it also amortizes MSRs in proportion to the net servicing revenue expected to be earned. Subsequent to the initial recording, MSRs are amortized and carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our expenses included $101.5 million and $78.4 million of MSR amortization, respectively. $17.1 million of the increase in MSR amortization was due to an impairment of the MSR to fair value resulting from a year over year decline in interest rates.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net of $81.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily related to the recognition of income from the receipt of Nasdaq shares of $113.9 million, including appreciation of Nasdaq shares held by Newmark, and unrealized gains of $12.2 million relating to non-marketable investments carried under the measurement alternative, partially offset by mark-to-market losses related to the Nasdaq Forwards of $51.1 million.\nInterest (Expense) Income, Net\nInterest expense, net decreased by $18.1 million to $32.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Interest expense decreased due to the reduction in our long-term debt.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes decreased by $38.1 million, or 42.1%, to $52.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily driven by the mix of allocable revenues among legal entities as a corporation versus flow through and certain return to provision adjustments, in addition to the revaluation of the deferred tax assets in the prior year, due to the Spin-Off. In general, our consolidated effective tax rate can vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of our earnings.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by $40.8 million, or 47.9%, to $44.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to the change in Newmark's corporate structure related to the Separation.\nYear ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017\nRevenues\nLeasing and Other Commissions\nLeasing and other commission revenues increased by $200.5 million, or 32.5%, to $817.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was due to organic growth.\nCapital Markets\nCapital markets revenue increased by $71.2 million, or 17.9%, to $468.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was driven by strong improvement in volumes for the investment sales and mortgage brokerage business.\nGains from Mortgage Banking Activities/Originations, Net\nGains from mortgage banking activities, net decreased by $23.7 million, or 11.5%, to $182.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by lower OMSR revenue of $17.8 million. As with other multifamily agency lenders, the Company's mix of originations, and therefore revenues, can vary depending on the size of loans, as well by the categories of loans with respect to the FHA, Freddie Mac, and different Fannie Mae structures.\nA portion of our gains from mortgage banking activities, net, relate to non-cash gains attributable to OMSRs. We recognize OMSR gains equal to the fair value of servicing rights retained on mortgage loans originated and sold. For the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recognized $103.2 million and $121.0 million of non-cash gains, respectively, related to OMSRs.\nManagement Services, Servicing Fees and Other\nManagement services, servicing fees and other revenue increased $203.2 million, or 54.1%, to $579.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. $86.2 million of the increase was related to additional pass-through revenues resulting from the implementation of ASC 606, while $59.5 million was related to the valuation and advisory business. Additionally, $21.3 million or 19.3% of the increase was related to servicing fee revenues, which includes interest income of $9.0 million on Loans held for sale.\nExpenses\nCompensation and Employee Benefits\nCompensation and employee benefits expense increased by $174.3 million, or 17.6%, to $1,162.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The main drivers of this increase were $122.4 million of additional payments directly related to the increase in revenues.\nEquity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\nEquity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs increased by $77.5 million, or 52.7%, to $224.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily driven by an increase of $79.9 million in exchangeability and common stock charges and an increase in allocations of income of $26.2 million as a result of an increase in pre-tax earnings.\nOperating, Administrative and Other\nOperating, administrative and other expenses increased $112.6 million, or 51.4%, to $331.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily driven by $86.2 million directly related to additional pass-through expenses resulting from the implementation of ASC 606. Additionally, interest expense on the warehouse facilities collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises increased $7.3 million, which is commensurate with the increase in interest income on Loans held for sale.\nFees to Related Parties\nFees to related parties increased by $5.4 million, or 26.0%, to $26.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Fees to related parties are allocations paid to BGC Partners and Cantor for administrative and support services.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $1.9 million, or 2.0%, to $97.7 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was due to a $5.9 million increase in mortgage servicing rights amortization and $1.4 million increase in fixed asset depreciation, partially offset by lower intangible asset amortization of $5.4 million.\nBecause the Company recognizes OMSR gains equal to the fair value of servicing rights retained on mortgage loans originated and sold, it also amortizes MSRs in proportion to the net servicing revenue expected to be earned. Subsequent to the initial recording, MSRs are amortized and carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. For the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our expenses included $78.4 million and $72.5 million of MSR amortization, respectively.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income of $127.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily related to the recognition of income from the receipt of Nasdaq shares of $87.2 million, as well as the mark-to-market adjustment related to the variable share forward of $19.0 million, and recognized gain of $17.9 million relating to investments carried under the measurement alternative of ASU 2016-01. Other income of $73.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily related to the recognition of income from the receipt of Nasdaq shares of $76.3 million.\nInterest (Expense) Income, Net\nInterest expense of $50.2 million incurred during the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily related to $58.4 million of interest expense on Newmark's debt, which included a $7.0 million prepayment fee on long- term debt repaid as part of the Spin-Off. This was partially offset by $4.7 million of interest income primarily related to interest income on employee loans and $3.8 million of interest earned on bank deposits.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes increased by $33.0 million, or 57.4%, to $90.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily driven by the mix of allocable revenues among legal entities as a corporation versus flow through and certain return to provision adjustments, partially offset by changes in the valuation allowance. In general, our consolidated effective tax rate can vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of our earnings.\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was $85.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was attributable to the change in Newmark's corporate structure related to the Separation.\nQUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly results of operations for the indicated periods (in thousands).

Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nThe primary source of liquidity for our business is the cash flow provided by our operations.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of sales growth, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities, our expansion into other markets and our results of operations. To the extent that existing cash, cash from operations and credit facilities, and Nasdaq shares are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public equity or debt financing. As of December 31, 2019, our long-term debt consists of our 6.125% Senior Notes with a carrying amount of $540.4 million and $50.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facility.\nBalance Sheet\nTotal assets at December 31, 2019 were $3,201.5 million as compared to $3,454.2 million at December 31, 2018. The decrease of $252.6 million can be attributed to a decrease in loans held for sale, at fair value of $775.6 million, offset by an increase in ROU assets of $201.7 million, an increase in loans from employees and partners of $118.2 million related to our continued hiring of industry leading professionals, an increase in other assets of $71.4 million and an increase in receivables, net of $56.8 million.\nTotal liabilities at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $2,239.4 million and $2,371.2 million, respectively. The decrease of $131.8 million can be attributed to a decrease in warehouse facilities collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored\nEnterprises of $762.8 million, offset by an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities of $313.0 million, an increase in ROU liabilities of $227.9 million, and an increase in long-term debt of $51.4 million.\nLiquidity\nFees to related parties that are charged by BGC Partners and/or Cantor to Newmark are reflected as cash flows from operating activities in our accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows for each period presented. All other amounts sent to or from BGC Partners and Cantor are reflected as cash flows from financing activities in our accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows for each period presented.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was $986.8 million. However, excluding activity from loan originations and sales, net cash provided by operating activities was $211.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. We expect to generate cash flows from operations to fund our business operations and growth strategy to meet our short-term liquidity requirements, which we define as the next 12 months. We also expect that cash flows from operations, cash on hand, and our $250.0 million Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our operations, growth strategy and dividends and distributions to meet our long-term liquidity requirements.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our liquidity, which Newmark defines as cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities, less securities loaned, was $163.6 million. This does not include the approximately $638.0 million in additional Nasdaq stock (stock value based on the February 12, 2020 closing price) that Newmark expects to receive between 2020 and 2027. Newmark expects to use its considerable financial resources to repay debt, profitably hire, make accretive acquisitions, pay dividends, and/or repurchase shares and units of Newmark, all while maintaining or improving its credit profile.\nLong-term debt\nLong-term debt consisted of the following (in thousands):\nTable 229: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6.125% Senior Notes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>540,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>537,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit Facility\n</td> <td>48,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>589,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>537,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n6.125% Senior Notes\nOn November 2, 2018, Newmark announced the pricing of an offering of $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Senior Notes due 2023, which closed on November 6, 2018. The 6.125% Senior Notes were offered and sold in a private offering exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act. The 6.125% Senior Notes are general senior unsecured obligations of Newmark. These 6.125% Senior Notes were priced at 98.937% to yield 6.375%. The 6.125% Senior Notes bear an interest rate of 6.125% per annum, payable on each May 15 and November 15, beginning on May 15, 2019 and will mature on November 15, 2023. The 6.125% Senior Notes were subsequently exchanged for notes with substantially similar terms that were registered under the Securities Act.\nCredit Facility\nOn November 28, 2018, Newmark entered into a Credit Agreement by and among Newmark, the several financial institutions from time to time party thereto, as Lenders, and Bank of America N.A., as administrative agent. The Credit Agreement provides for a $250.0 million three-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2019, there were $50.0 of million borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the Credit Facility will bear an annual interest equal to, at Newmark's option, either (a) London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) for specified periods, or upon the consent of all Lenders, such other period that is 12 months or less, plus an applicable margin, or (b) a base rate equal to the greatest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, (ii) the prime rate as established by the administrative agent, and (iii) one-month LIBOR plus 1.0%. The applicable margin is 200 basis points with respect to LIBOR borrowings in (a) above and can range 0.25% to 1.25% higher, depending upon Newmark's credit rating. The Credit Facility also provides for an unused facility fee.\nCantor Credit Agreement\nOn November 30, 2018 Newmark entered into an unsecured credit agreement with Cantor. The Cantor Credit Agreement provides for each party to issue loans to the other party in the lender's discretion. Pursuant to the Cantor Credit Agreement, the parties and their respective subsidiaries (with respect to CFLP, other than BGC and its subsidiaries) may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $250.0 million from each other from time to time at an interest rate which is the higher of CFLP's or Newmark's short-term borrowing rate then in effect, plus 1.0%. As of December 31, 2019, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Cantor Credit Agreement.\nWarehouse Facilities Collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises\nAs of December 31, 2019, Newmark had $1.1 billion of committed loan funding available through three commercial banks, an uncommitted warehouse line of $300.0 million, and an uncommitted $400.0 million Fannie Mae loan repurchase facility. Consistent with industry practice, these warehouse facilities are short-term, requiring annual renewal. These warehouse facilities are collateralized by an assignment of the underlying mortgage loans originated under its various lending programs and third-party purchase commitments and are recourse only to our wholly-owned subsidiary, Berkeley Point Capital, LLC. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $209.6 million and $972.4 million outstanding under Warehouse facilities collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises\u201d on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nCash Flows\nCash flows from operations excluding activity from loan originations and sales, net were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 230: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>986,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(332,367\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>853,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add back:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan originations - loans held for sale\n</td> <td>8,783,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,612,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,844,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan sales - loans held for sale\n</td> <td>(9,563,973\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,002,872\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,556,163\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized gains on loans held for sale\n</td> <td>5,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities excluding activity from loan originations and sales (1) (2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>211,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>295,862\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>144,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 231: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes payments for corporate taxes in the amounts of $95.1 million, $1.2 million and $0.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 232: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Includes payments for new hires and producers in the amount of $161.9 million, $109.6 million, and $34.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated $986.8 million of cash from operations. However, excluding activity from loan originations and sales, net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $211.2 million. We had consolidated net income of $161.7 million, $222.6 million of positive adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash used by operating activities (excluding activity from loan originations and sales) and $173.1 million of negative changes in operating assets and liabilities. The negative change in operating assets and liabilities included $161.9 million of increases in loans, forgivable loans and other receivables from employees and partners primarily related to continued hiring and expansion of our business, $113.2 million of increases in other assets, and $52.0 million of increase in receivables, net, offset by an increase of $130.7 million in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities and an increase of $23.4 million in payables to related parties. Cash used in investing activities was $56.8 million, primarily related to $34.5 million in purchases of fixed assets, $33.9 million of payments for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, $28.0 million in purchases of non-marketable investments, net, partially offset by $32.6 million of proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, and $8.6 million of distributions from Real Estate L.P. We used $895.5 million of cash from financing activities primarily due to net repayments on the warehouse facilities collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises of $762.7 million, distributions to limited partnership interests and other noncontrolling interests of $140.6 million, dividends to stockholders of $69.2 million and treasury stock repurchases of $37.4 million, partially offset by net borrowings under the Credit Facility of $50.0 million, the settlement of pre-Spin-Off related party receivables of $33.9 million, and proceeds from securities loaned of $36.7 million.\nCash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we used $332.4 million of cash from operations. However, excluding activity from loan originations and sales, net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $295.9 million. We had consolidated net income of $191.9 million, $149.9 million of positive adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash used by operating activities (excluding activity from loan originations and sales) and $45.9 million of negative changes in operating assets and liabilities. The negative change in operating assets and liabilities included $109.6 million of increases in loans, forgivable loans and other receivables from employees and partners primarily related to continued hiring and expansion of our business and $129.5 million of increase in receivables related to acquisitions and increased revenues, offset by an increase of $203.1 million in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities. Cash provided by investing activities was $7.7 million, primarily related to $95.9 million of proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, partially offset by $34.5 million of payments for acquisitions, $29.5 million in non-marketable investments and $21.0 million of purchases of fixed assets. We generated $338.6 million of cash from financing activities primarily due to net proceeds from warehouse facilities collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises of $611.9 million, $242.0 million of proceeds from BGC's 2018\ninvestment in Newmark, net proceeds from 6.125% Senior Notes of $537.5 million, $262.2 million proceeds from the Newmark OpCo Preferred Investment, partially offset by distributions to limited partnership interests and noncontrolling interests of $46.5 million, and dividends of $41.8 million, and $1,156.0 million repayment of long-term debt.\nCash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated $853.6 million of cash from operations. We had net income of $145.1 million, $705.1 million of adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities, and $3.4 million of positive changes in operating assets and liabilities. $711.4 million of adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities was related to loans held for sale. The positive change in operating assets and liabilities was driven by a $58.9 million increase in our accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, including accrued compensation, and a $36.1 increase in other assets, partially offset by a $91.5 million negative change in operating assets and liabilities as a result of an increase in outstanding receivables and employee loans and other receivables. We generated $0.4 million of cash provided by investing activities primarily related to proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, offset by purchases of fixed assets. We used $798.2 million of cash from financing activities primarily due to net payments to related parties of $746.9 million, $101.8 million of distribution of earnings to BGC and $89.1 million distribution related to Berkeley Point acquisition, offset by $57.6 million of proceeds from secured loans.\nCredit Ratings\nAs of December 31, 2019, our public long-term credit ratings and associated outlooks are as follows:\nTable 233: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Outlook\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fitch Ratings Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standards & Poor's\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BB+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Kroll Bond Rating Agency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCredit ratings and associated outlooks are influenced by several factors, including but not limited to: operating environment, earnings and profitability trends, the prudence of funding and liquidity management practices, balance sheet size/composition and resulting leverage, cash flow coverage of interest, composition and size of the capital base, available liquidity, outstanding borrowing levels and the firm's competitive position in the industry. A credit rating and/or the associated outlook can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change. Any reduction in our credit ratings and/or the associated outlook could adversely affect the availability of debt financing on terms acceptable to us, as well as the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain any such financing. In addition, credit ratings and associated outlooks may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions. In connection with certain agreements, interest rates on our notes may incur increases of up to 2% in the event of a credit ratings downgrade.\nRegulatory Requirements\nNewmark is subject to various capital requirements in connection with seller/servicer agreements that Newmark has entered into with the various GSEs. Failure to maintain minimum capital requirements could result in Newmark's inability to originate and service loans for the respective GSEs and could have a direct material adverse effect on our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2019, Newmark has met all capital requirements. As of December 31, 2019, the most restrictive capital requirement was Fannie Mae's net worth requirement. Newmark exceeded the minimum requirement by $299.9 million.\nCertain of Newmark's agreements with Fannie Mae allow Newmark to originate and service loans under Fannie Mae's Delegated Underwriting and Servicing ( DUS\u201d) Program. These agreements require Newmark to maintain sufficient collateral to meet Fannie Mae's restricted and operational liquidity requirements based on a pre-established formula. Certain of Newmark's agreements with Freddie Mac allow Newmark to service loans under Freddie Mac's Targeted Affordable Housing ( TAH\u201d) Program. These agreements require Newmark to pledge sufficient collateral to meet Freddie Mac's liquidity requirement of 8% of the outstanding principal of TAH loans serviced by Newmark. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, Newmark has met all liquidity requirements.\nIn addition, as a servicer for Fannie Mae, the Government National Mortgage Association ( Ginnie Mae\u201d) and FHA, Newmark is required to advance to investors any uncollected principal and interest due from borrowers. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, outstanding borrower advances were $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively, and are included in Other assets\u201d in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nOn September 9, 2019, the U.S. Department of the Treasury issued a Housing Reform Plan (the Plan\u201d) in response to a March 27, 2019 Presidential Memorandum soliciting reforms in the housing financing system designed to minimize taxpayer exposure to future bailouts. The primary recommendations of the Plan are: (i) that existing government support for the secondary markets should be explicitly defined, tailored and paid for; (ii) that the GSEs' conservatorship should come to an end; (iii) the implementation of reforms necessary to ensure that the GSEs, and any successors, are appropriately capitalized to withstand a severe economic downturn and that shareholders and unsecured creditors, rather than U.S. taxpayers, bear the losses; (iv) that the GSEs should continue to support affordable housing at a reasonable economic return that may be less than the return earned on other activities; (v) that the FHFA and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development should clearly define the appropriate roles and overlap between the GSEs and the Federal Housing Administration so as to avoid duplication and (vi) that measures should be implemented to level the playing field\u201d between the GSEs and private sector competitors. Additionally, in September 2019, FHFA announced a cap of $200 billion as the maximum volume for combined Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac multifamily volume through the end of 2020, of which 37.5% must meet certain affordability requirements. The foregoing proposals may have the effect of impacting the volume of business that we may do with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Additionally, the potential increase in our proportion of affordable business and the potential implementation of a fee to be charged in connection with the government's offer of a guarantee may alter the economics of the business and, accordingly, may impact our financial results.\nSee Regulation\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our regulatory environment.\nEQUITY\nShare Exchange Agreement\nIn relation to the IPO, on December 13, 2017, Newmark entered into an exchange agreement with Cantor, CFGM, BGC and other Cantor affiliates entitled to hold Class B common stock, providing the right to exchange from time to time shares of Class A common stock of Newmark now owned or hereafter acquired, as applicable, on a one-for-one basis for shares of Class B common stock, up to the number of shares of Newmark Class B common stock that are authorized but unissued under Newmark's certificate of incorporation. The Newmark Audit Committee and Board of Directors have determined that the exchange agreement is in the best interests of Newmark and its stockholders because, among other things, it will help ensure that Cantor retains its exchangeable limited partnership units in Newmark Holdings, which is the same partnership in which Newmark's partner employees participate, thus continuing to align the interests of Cantor with those of the partner employees.\nRepurchase Program\nOn August 1, 2018, the Newmark Board of Directors and Audit Committee authorized repurchases of shares of Newmark's Class A common stock and purchases of limited partnership interests or other equity interests in Newmark's subsidiaries up to $200 million, increased from the $100 million that had been authorized on March 12, 2018. This authorization includes repurchases of stock or units from executive officers, other employees and partners, including of BGC and Cantor, as well as other affiliated persons or entities. From time to time, Newmark may actively continue to repurchase shares and/or purchase units. As of December 31, 2019, Newmark has repurchased 4.6 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $9.32. As of December 31, 2019, Newmark had $157.4 million remaining from its share repurchase and unit purchase authorization.\nThe following table details our share repurchase activity during 2019, including the total number of shares purchased, the average price paid per share, the number of shares repurchased as part of our publicly announced repurchase program and the approximate value that may yet be purchased under such program (in thousands except share and per share amounts):\nTable 234: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Period\n</td> <td>Total\nNumber of\nShares\nRepurchased/Purchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average\nPrice Paid\nper Unit\nor Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Number of Shares Repurchased as Part of Publicly Announced Program\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Approximate\nDollar Value\nof Units and\nShares That\nMay Yet Be\nRepurchased/\nPurchased\nUnder the Plan\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at beginning of period\n</td> <td>50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9.73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>199,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>January 1, 2019 - March 31, 2019\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>April 1, 2019 - June 30, 2019\n</td> <td>1,613,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.61\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,613,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>July 1, 2019 - September 30, 2019\n</td> <td>2,279,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.81\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,279,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>October 1, 2019 - December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>625,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.97\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>625,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>4,568,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,568,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>157,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn October 30, 2019, the Audit and Compensation Committees of the Board of Directors authorized and the Company executed the repurchase from Mr. Merkel of 55,193 shares of Newmark Class A common stock at $10.69 per share, the closing price on October 30, 2019.\nOn December 19, 2019, the Audit and Compensation Committees of the Board of Directors authorized and the Company executed the repurchase from Mr. Merkel of 132,429 shares of Newmark Class A common stock at $13.61 per share, the closing price on December 19, 2019.\nFully Diluted Share Count\nOur fully diluted weighted-average share count for the year ended December 31, 2019 was as follows (in thousands):\nTable 235: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common stock outstanding(1)\n</td> <td>177,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Partnership units(2)\n</td> <td>89,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RSUs (Treasury stock method)\n</td> <td>1,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Newmark exchange shares\n</td> <td>369\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total(3)\n</td> <td>268,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 236: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Common stock consisted of Class A shares, Class B shares and contingent shares for which all necessary conditions have been satisfied except for the passage of time.

The contingent cash liability is recorded at fair value as deferred consideration on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nEquity Method Investments\nNewmark has an investment in Real Estate LP, a joint venture with Cantor in which Newmark has a less than majority ownership and has the ability to exert significant influence over the operating and financial policies. As of December 31, 2019, Newmark had $100.0 million in this equity method investment, which represents a 27% ownership in Real Estate LP.\nRegistration Statements\nIn January 2019, we filed a registration statement on Form S-4 pursuant to which the holders of our 6.125% Senior Notes which were issued in a private placement were offered an opportunity to exchange such notes for new registered notes with substantially identical terms. The registration statement was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and, on February 5, 2019, we announced an offer to exchange up to all $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6.125% Senior Notes for an equivalent amount of 6.125% Senior Notes registered under the Securities Act. The exchange offer closed on March 14, 2019, and the 6.125% Senior Notes were subsequently exchanged for notes with substantially similar terms that were registered under the Securities Act.\nOn March 28, 2019, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 pursuant to which CF&Co may make offers and sales of our 6.125% Senior Notes in connection with ongoing market-making transactions which may occur from time to time. Such market-making transactions in these securities may occur in the open market or may be privately negotiated at prevailing market prices at a time of resale or at related or negotiated prices. Neither CF&Co, nor any of our affiliates, has any obligation to make a market in our securities, and CF&Co or any such other affiliate may discontinue market-making activities at any time without notice. Newmark does not receive any proceeds from market-making activities in these securities by CF&Co (or any of its affiliates).\nWe have an effective registration statement on Form S-4, with respect to the offer and sale of up to 20.0 million shares of our Class A common stock from time to time in connection with business combination transactions, including acquisitions of other businesses, assets, properties or securities. As of December 31, 2019, we have issued 0.4 million shares of our Class A common stock under this registration statement.\nNewmark's Compensation Committee may grant various equity-based awards to employees of Newmark, including restricted stock units, limited partnership units and exchange rights for shares of Newmark's Class A common stock upon exchange of Newmark limited partnership units (See Note 2 - Limited Partnership Interests in Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings\u201d, to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). On December 13, 2017, as part of the Separation, the Newmark Group, Inc. Long Term Incentive Plan (the Newmark Equity Plan\u201d) was approved by Newmark's sole stockholder at the time, BGC, for Newmark to issue up to 400.0 million aggregate number of shares of Class A common stock of Newmark, of which 65.0 million are pursuant to effective registration statements on Form S-8 that may be delivered or cash-settled pursuant to awards granted during the life of the Newmark Equity Plan. As of December 31, 2019, awards with respect to 20.8 million shares have been granted and 379.2 million shares are available for future awards.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 240: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>347,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>146,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Warehouse facilities collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises(2)\n</td> <td>209,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>209,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt(3)\n</td> <td>600,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>550,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on long-term debt(4)\n</td> <td>134,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on warehouse facilities collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises(5)\n</td> <td>5,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,296,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>295,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>201,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>653,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>146,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 241: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Operating leases are related to rental payments under various non-cancelable leases principally for office space.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 242: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Warehouse facilities are collateralized by $215.3 million of loans held for sale, at fair value (See Note 21- Warehouse Facilities Collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises\u201d to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) which loans were either under commitment to be purchased by Freddie Mac or had confirmed forward trade commitments for the issuance of and purchase of Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 243: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Long-term debt reflects long-term borrowings of $550.0 million 6.125% Senior Notes.

Newmark also has corresponding commitments to sell these loans to various purchasers as they are funded.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP guidance requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our accompanying consolidated financial statements. These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, our accompanying consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows could be materially affected. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenues primarily through commissions from brokerage services, gains from mortgage banking activities/originations, net, revenues from real estate management services, servicing fees and other revenues. Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when, or as, Newmark satisfies its performance obligations by transferring the promised goods or services to the customers as determined by when, or as, the customer obtains control of that good or service. A performance obligation may be satisfied over time or at a point in time. Revenue from a performance obligation satisfied over time is recognized by measuring Newmark's progress in satisfying the performance obligation as evidenced by the transfer of the goods or services to the customer. Revenue from a performance obligation satisfied at a point in time is recognized at the point in time when the customer obtains control over the promised good or service. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those promised goods or services (i.e., the transaction price\u201d). In determining the transaction price, we consider consideration promised in a contract that includes a variable amount, referred to as variable consideration, and estimate the amount of consideration due Newmark. Additionally, variable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. In determining when to include variable consideration in the transaction price, Newmark considers all information (historical, current and forecast) that is available, including the range of possible outcomes, the predictive value of past experiences, the time period of when uncertainties expect to be resolved and the amount of consideration that is susceptible to factors outside of Newmark's influence.\nWe also use third-party service providers in the provision of its services to customers. In instances where a third-party service provider is used, Newmark performs an analysis to determine whether Newmark is acting as a principal or an agent with respect to the services provided. To the extent that Newmark determines that it is acting as a principal, the revenue and the expenses incurred are recorded on a gross basis. In instances where Newmark has determined that it is acting as an agent, the revenue and expenses are presented on a net basis within the revenue line item.\nIn some instances, Newmark performs services for customers and incurs out-of-pocket expenses as part of delivering those services. Newmark's customers agree to reimburse Newmark for those expenses, and those reimbursements are part of the contract's transaction price. Consequently, these expenses and the reimbursements of such expenses from the customer are presented on a gross basis because the services giving rise to the out-of-pocket expenses do not transfer a good or service. The reimbursements are included in the transaction price when the costs are incurred, and the reimbursements are due from the customer.\nMSRs, Net\nNewmark initially recognizes and measures the rights to service mortgage loans at fair value and subsequently measures them using the amortization method. Newmark recognizes rights to service mortgage loans as separate assets at the time the underlying originated mortgage loan is sold, and the value of those rights is included in the determination of the gains on loans held for sale. Purchased MSRs, including MSRs purchased from CCRE, are initially recorded at fair value, and subsequently measured using the amortization method.\nNewmark receives up to a 3-basis point servicing fee and/or up to a 1-basis point surveillance fee on certain Freddie Mac loans after the loan is securitized in a Freddie Mac pool ( Freddie Mac Strip\u201d). The Freddie Mac Strip is also recognized at fair value and subsequently measured using the amortization method, but is recognized as a MSR at the securitization date.\nMSRs are assessed for impairment, at least on an annual basis, based upon the fair value of those rights as compared to the amortized cost. Fair values are estimated using a valuation model that calculates the present value of the future net servicing cash flows. In using this valuation method, Newmark incorporates assumptions that management believes market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income. The fair value estimates are sensitive to significant assumptions used in the valuation model such as prepayment rates, cost of servicing, escrow earnings rates, discount rates and servicing multiples, which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions derived, in part, from historical data. It is reasonably possible that such estimates may change. Newmark amortizes the MSRs in proportion to, and\nover the period of, the projected net servicing income. For purposes of impairment evaluation and measurement, Newmark stratifies MSRs based on predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans, primarily by investor type (Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac, FHA/GNMA, CMBS and other). To the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of a specific MSR strata, a valuation allowance is established, which is adjusted in the future as the fair value of MSRs increases or decreases. Reversals of valuation allowances cannot exceed the previously recognized impairment up to the amortized cost.\nEquity-Based and Other Compensation\nDiscretionary Bonus: A portion of our compensation and employee benefits expense comprises discretionary bonuses, which may be paid in cash, equity, partnership awards or a combination thereof. We accrue expense in a period based on revenues in that period and on the expected combination of cash, equity and partnership units. Given the assumptions used in estimating discretionary bonuses, actual results may differ.\nRestricted Stock Units: We account for equity-based compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of U.S. GAAP guidance. Restricted stock units (which we refer to as RSUs\u201d) provided to certain employees are accounted for as equity awards, and in accordance with U.S. GAAP guidance, we are required to record an expense for the portion of the RSUs that is ultimately expected to vest. Further, U.S. GAAP guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Because significant assumptions are used in estimating employee turnover and associated forfeiture rates, actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe fair value of RSU awards to employees is determined on the date of grant, based on the fair value of our Class A common stock. Generally, RSUs granted by us as employee compensation do not receive dividend equivalents; as such, we adjust the fair value of the RSUs for the present value of expected forgone dividends, which requires us to include an estimate of expected dividends as a valuation input. This grant-date fair value is amortized to expense ratably over the awards' vesting periods. For RSUs with graded vesting features, we have made an accounting policy election to recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis. The amortization is reflected as non-cash equity-based compensation expense in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nRestricted Stock: Restricted stock provided to certain employees is accounted for as an equity award, and as per U.S. GAAP guidance, we are required to record an expense for the portion of the restricted stock that is ultimately expected to vest. We have granted restricted stock that is not subject to continued employment or service; however, transferability is subject to compliance with our and our affiliates' customary non-compete obligations. Such shares of restricted stock are generally saleable by partners in 5 to 10 years. Because the restricted stock is not subject to continued employment or service, the grant-date fair value of the restricted stock is expensed on the date of grant. The expense is reflected as non-cash equity-based compensation expense in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nLimited Partnership Units: Limited partnership units in Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings are held by Newmark employees and receive quarterly allocations of net income and are generally contingent upon services being provided by the unit holders. As discussed above, preferred units in Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings are not entitled to participate in partnership distributions other than with respect to a distribution at a rate of either 0.6875% (which is 2.75% per calendar year) or such other amount as set forth in the award documentation. The quarterly allocations of net income to such limited partnership units are reflected as a component of compensation expense under Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nCertain of these limited partnership units entitle the holders to receive post-termination payments equal to the notional amount in four equal yearly installments after the holder's termination. These limited partnership units are accounted for as post-termination liability awards under U.S. GAAP guidance, which requires that Newmark record an expense for such awards based on the change in value at each reporting period and include the expense in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations as part of Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs.\u201d The liability for limited partnership units with a post-termination payout is included in Other long-term liabilities\u201d on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nCertain limited partnership units held by Newmark employees are granted exchangeability into Class A common stock or may be redeemed in connection with the grant of shares of Class A common stock. At the time exchangeability is granted, or the shares are issued, Newmark recognizes an expense based on the fair value of the award on that date, which is included in Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nEmployee Loans: We have entered into various agreements with certain of our employees and partners whereby these individuals receive loans that may be either wholly or in part repaid from distributions that the individuals receive on some or all of their limited partnership interests or may be forgiven over a period of time. Cash advance distribution loans are documented in formal agreements and are repayable in timeframes outlined in the underlying agreements. We intend for these\nadvances to be repaid in full from the future distributions on existing and future awards granted. The allocations of net income to the awards are treated as compensation expense and the proceeds from distributions are used to repay the loan. The forgivable portion of any loans is recognized as compensation expense in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations over the life of the loan. We review the loan balances each reporting period for collectability. If we determine that the collectability of a portion of the loan balances is not expected, we recognize a reserve against the loan balances. Actual collectability of loan balances may differ from our estimates. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the aggregate balance of employee loans, net of reserve, was $403.7 million and $285.5 million, respectively, and is included as Loans, forgivable loans and other receivables from employees and partners, net\u201d in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Compensation expense for the above-mentioned employee loans for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 were $39.0 million, $27.7 million, and $34.4 million, respectively. The compensation expense related to these loans was included as part of Compensation and employee benefits\u201d in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. As prescribed in U.S. GAAP guidance, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is not amortized, but instead is periodically tested for impairment. We review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever an event occurs, or circumstances change that could reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.\nWhen reviewing goodwill for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, or if we choose to bypass the qualitative assessment, we perform a goodwill impairment analysis using a two-step process. Newmark had goodwill balances as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 of $557.9 million and $515.3 million, respectively.\nThe first step of the process involves comparing each reporting unit's estimated fair value with its carrying value, including goodwill. To estimate the fair value of the reporting units, we use a discounted cash flow model and data regarding market comparables. The valuation process requires significant judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These assumptions include cash flow projections, estimated cost of capital and the selection of peer companies and relevant multiples. Because significant assumptions and estimates are used in projecting future cash flows, choosing peer companies and selecting relevant multiples, actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is deemed not to be impaired. If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of potential impairment.\nThe second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated a potential impairment may exist. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one, over the estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identified intangibles. Events such as economic weakness, significant declines in operating results of reporting units, or significant changes to critical inputs of the goodwill impairment test (e.g., estimates of cash flows or cost of capital) could cause the estimated fair value of our reporting units to decline, which could result in an impairment of goodwill in the future.\nIncome Taxes\nNewmark accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method as prescribed in U.S. GAAP guidance, Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to basis differences between our accompanying consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Certain of Newmark's entities are taxed as U.S. partnerships and are subject to UBT in New York City. Therefore, the tax liability or benefit related to the partnership income or loss except for UBT rests with the partners, rather than the partnership entity. As such, the partners' tax liability or benefit is not reflected in our accompanying consolidated financial statements. The tax-related assets, liabilities, provisions or benefits included in our accompanying consolidated financial statements also reflect the results of the entities that are taxed as corporations, either in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions.\nNewmark's income taxes as presented are calculated on a separate return basis for the periods prior to the Spin-Off and have historically been included in BGC's U.S. federal and state tax returns or separate non-U.S. jurisdictions tax returns. Subsequent to the spin, Newmark will file its own stand-alone tax returns for its operations within these jurisdictions. The 2018 tax results reflect both the pre and post spin periods and as such Newmark's tax results as presented are not necessarily reflective of the results that Newmark would have generated on a stand-alone basis.\nNewmark provides for uncertain tax positions based upon management's assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. Management is required to determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Because significant assumptions are used in determining whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities, actual results may differ from Newmark's estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Newmark recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in Provision for income taxes\u201d in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nA valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if it is deemed more likely than not that those assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, Newmark considers all available evidence, including past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies.\nThe measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of enacted tax laws and involves uncertainties in the application of tax regulations in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions. Because Newmark's interpretation of complex tax law may impact the measurement of current and deferred income taxes, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions regarding the application of tax law.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe have loan commitments to extend credit to third parties. The commitments to extend credit are for mortgage loans at a specific rate (rate lock commitments). These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require a fee. We are committed to extend credit to the counterparty as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the commitment contracts.\nWe simultaneously enter into an agreement to deliver such mortgages to third-party investors at a fixed price (forward sale contracts).\nBoth the commitment to extend credit and the forward sale commitment qualify as derivative financial instruments. We recognize all derivatives on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities measured at fair value. The change in the derivatives fair value is recognized in current period earnings.\nNewmark entered into four variable postpaid forward contracts as a result of the Nasdaq Forwards. These contracts qualify as derivative financial instruments. The Nasdaq Forwards provide Newmark with the ability to redeem the EPUs for Nasdaq stock, and as these instruments are not legally detachable, they represent single financial instruments. The financial instruments' EPU redemption feature for Nasdaq common stock is not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of Newmark's EPU equity host instruments, and, therefore, it represents an embedded derivative that is required to be bifurcated and recorded at fair value on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets, with all changes in fair value recorded as a component of Other income (loss), net\u201d on our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

Additionally, on December 19, 2019, Mr. Merkel exchanged 4,222 already exchangeable Newmark Holdings PSUs held by him in exchange for Class A common stock. The above transaction resulted in income of $3,791,848 for Mr. Merkel, of which the Company withheld $1,989,483 for taxes and issued the remaining $1,802,365 in the form of 132,429 net shares of Class A common stock at a price of $13.61 per share.\nOn December 19, 2019, the Compensation Committee approved the right to (i) convert 5,846 non-exchangeable Newmark Holdings PSUs held by Mr. Rispoli into 5,846 HDUs (which, based on the closing price of the Class A common stock of $13.61 per share on such date, had a value of $74,250); and (ii) exchange for cash 4,917 Newmark Holdings non-exchangeable PPSUs held by Mr. Rispoli (which had an average determination price of $12.355 per unit) for a payment of $60,750 for taxes when (i) is exchanged.\nIn connection with the Company's 2018 executive compensation process, the Company's executive officers received certain monetization of prior awards as compensation at Newmark, as set forth below.\nOn December 31, 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the monetization of 898,080 BGC Holdings, PPSUs held by Mr. Lutnick (which had an average determination price of $7.65 per unit), and 592,721 Newmark Holdings PPSUs (which had an average determination price of $13.715 per unit), which transactions had an aggregate value of $15,000,000.

On April 25, 2019, the Compensation Committee modified Mr. Gosin's awards by canceling the grant of the previously mentioned Newmark Holdings NPSUs and NPPSUs and by granting non-exchangeable Newmark Holdings PSUs and PPSUs. The Committee approved this modification in order to reflect an annual compensation structure rather than a long-term NPSU/NPPSU structure.\nOn December 31, 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the cancellation of 13,552 non-exchangeable PSUs in BGC Holdings held by Mr. Rispoli and the cancellation of 11,089 BGC Holdings PPSUs (which had an average determination price of $5.814 per unit).

A credit rating and/or the associated outlook can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change. Any reduction in our credit ratings and/or the associated outlook could adversely affect the availability of debt financing on terms acceptable to us, as well as the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain any such financing. In addition, credit ratings and associated outlooks may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions. In connection with certain agreements, interest rates on our notes may incur increases of up to 2% in the event of a credit ratings downgrade.\nThe following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly results of operations for the indicated periods (in thousands). Results of any period are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year and may, in certain periods, be affected by seasonal fluctuations in our business.

The ability to convert the EPUs into Newmark Class A common stock is subject to the SPV's option to settle the postpaid forward contracts as described below. As the EPUs represent equity ownership of a consolidated subsidiary of Newmark, they have been included in Noncontrolling interests\u201d on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of changes in equity. The EPUs are entitled to a preferred payable-in-kind dividend, which is recorded as accretion to the carrying amount of the EPUs through Retained earnings\u201d on our accompanying consolidated statements of changes in equity and are reductions to Net income (loss) available to common stockholders\u201d for the purpose of calculating earnings per share.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of sales growth, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities, our expansion into other markets and our results of operations. To the extent that existing cash, cash from operations and credit facilities, and Nasdaq shares are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public equity or debt financing.

Newmark also has corresponding commitments to sell these loans to various purchasers as they are funded.\nCompensation and employee benefits expense increased by $174.3 million, or 17.6%, to $1,162.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The main drivers of this increase were $122.4 million of additional payments directly related to the increase in revenues.\nindustry are based on when loans are sold and/or securitized, and typically lag those reported by Newmark and its competitors by 30 to 45 days.\n\nOverview\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by $40.8 million, or 47.9%, to $44.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to the change in Newmark's corporate structure related to the Separation.\nEconomic Growth in the United States\nWe have an effective registration statement on Form S-4, with respect to the offer and sale of up to 20.0 million shares of our Class A common stock from time to time in connection with business combination transactions, including acquisitions of other businesses, assets, properties or securities. As of December 31, 2019, we have issued 0.4 million shares of our Class A common stock under this registration statement.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our public long-term credit ratings and associated outlooks are as follows:\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nAccording to NKF Research, the average vacancy rate for office improved 20 basis points year-over-year to 12.9%, industrial increased slightly to 5.2%, while retail rose 40 basis points compared with the year earlier. Against this backdrop, revenues from our leasing and other commissions business increased by 4.6% year-over-year in 2019.\nExpenses\nIn February 2019, the Audit Committee of the Company authorized Newmark and its subsidiaries to originate and service GSE loans to Cantor and its affiliates (other than BGC) and service loans originated by Cantor and its affiliates (other than BGC) on prices, rates and terms no less favorable to Newmark and its subsidiaries than those charged by third parties. The authorization is subject to certain terms and conditions, including but not limited to: (i) a maximum amount up to $100.0 million per loan, (ii) a $250.0 million limit on loans that have not yet been acquired or sold to a GSE at any given time, and (iii) a separate $250.0 million limit on originated Fannie Mae loans outstanding to Cantor at any given time.\nEquity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\nInterest (Expense) Income, Net\nThe measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of enacted tax laws and involves uncertainties in the application of tax regulations in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions. Because Newmark's interpretation of complex tax law may impact the measurement of current and deferred income taxes, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions regarding the application of tax law.\nMSRs are assessed for impairment, at least on an annual basis, based upon the fair value of those rights as compared to the amortized cost. Fair values are estimated using a valuation model that calculates the present value of the future net servicing cash flows. In using this valuation method, Newmark incorporates assumptions that management believes market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income. The fair value estimates are sensitive to significant assumptions used in the valuation model such as prepayment rates, cost of servicing, escrow earnings rates, discount rates and servicing multiples, which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions derived, in part, from historical data. It is reasonably possible that such estimates may change. Newmark amortizes the MSRs in proportion to, and\nBalance Sheet\n (2) Includes payments for new hires and producers in the amount of $161.9 million, $109.6 million, and $34.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nNewmark's loan origination volumes are driven more by the GSE multifamily financing volumes than the activity level of the overall commercial mortgage market. Overall industry GSE multifamily origination volumes increased by approximately 4% year-over-year in 2019. In comparison, Newmark's combined notional volumes across GSE and FHA multifamily loan originations increased by 16.1% year-over-year. The GSE multifamily agency volume statistics for the\nOther income, net of $81.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily related to the recognition of income from the receipt of Nasdaq shares of $113.9 million, including appreciation of Nasdaq shares held by Newmark, and unrealized gains of $12.2 million relating to non-marketable investments carried under the measurement alternative, partially offset by mark-to-market losses related to the Nasdaq Forwards of $51.1 million.\nSee Note 13 - Revenues from Contracts with Customers\u201d to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for further information.\nCompensation and Employee Benefits\ncapital account and $0.5 million of limited partnership units in exchange for the cash payment from Cantor to Newmark of $2.2 million. In consideration for the Cantor payment, Newmark has agreed to return up to a maximum of $3.3 million to Cantor based on the employees' production during their first two years of employment with Newmark. As of December 31, 2019, Newmark has $2.6 million included in Payables to related parties\u201d on the consolidated balance sheets, to be returned to Cantor related to this transaction. Newmark has agreed to allow certain of these employees to continue to provide consulting services to Cantor in exchange for a forgivable loan which was directly paid by Cantor to these employees.\nRevenues\nOn July 22, 2019, Cantor Commercial Real Estate Lending, L.P. ( CCRE Lending\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Real Estate LP, made a $146.6 million commercial real estate loan (the Loan\u201d) to a single-purpose company (the Borrower\u201d) in which Barry Gosin, Newmark's Chief Executive Officer, owns a 19% interest. The Loan is secured by the Borrower's interest in property in Pennsylvania that is subject to a ground lease. While CCRE Lending initially provided the full loan amount, on August 16, 2019, a third-party bank purchased approximately 80% of the Loan value from CCRE Lending, with CCRE Lending retaining approximately 20%. The Loan matures on August 6, 2029, and is payable monthly at a fixed interest rate of 4.38% per annum. Newmark provided certain commercial loan brokerage services to the Borrower in the ordinary course of its business, and the Borrower paid Newmark a fee, as the broker of the Loan, of $0.7 million. The Newmark Audit Committee approved the commercial loan brokerage services and the related fee amount received.\nLong-term debt\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we used $332.4 million of cash from operations. However, excluding activity from loan originations and sales, net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $295.9 million. We had consolidated net income of $191.9 million, $149.9 million of positive adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash used by operating activities (excluding activity from loan originations and sales) and $45.9 million of negative changes in operating assets and liabilities. The negative change in operating assets and liabilities included $109.6 million of increases in loans, forgivable loans and other receivables from employees and partners primarily related to continued hiring and expansion of our business and $129.5 million of increase in receivables related to acquisitions and increased revenues, offset by an increase of $203.1 million in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities. Cash provided by investing activities was $7.7 million, primarily related to $95.9 million of proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, partially offset by $34.5 million of payments for acquisitions, $29.5 million in non-marketable investments and $21.0 million of purchases of fixed assets. We generated $338.6 million of cash from financing activities primarily due to net proceeds from warehouse facilities collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises of $611.9 million, $242.0 million of proceeds from BGC's 2018\nEquity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs increased by $77.5 million, or 52.7%, to $224.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily driven by an increase of $79.9 million in exchangeability and common stock charges and an increase in allocations of income of $26.2 million as a result of an increase in pre-tax earnings.\nBGC's Investment in Newmark Holdings\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n \u2022 Apartment rents benefited from sustained job growth and underlying demographic trends towards apartment living among two key age groups: millennials and baby boomers; and \nAs of December 31, 2019, Newmark had $1.1 billion of committed loan funding available through three commercial banks, an uncommitted warehouse line of $300.0 million, and an uncommitted $400.0 million Fannie Mae loan repurchase facility. Consistent with industry practice, these warehouse facilities are short-term, requiring annual renewal. These warehouse facilities are collateralized by an assignment of the underlying mortgage loans originated under its various lending programs and third-party purchase commitments and are recourse only to our wholly-owned subsidiary, Berkeley Point Capital, LLC. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $209.6 million and $972.4 million outstanding under Warehouse facilities collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises\u201d on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\n \u2022 the principal corporate transactions pursuant to which BGC, BGC Holdings and BGC U.S. OpCo and their respective subsidiaries (other than the Newmark Group (defined below), the BGC Group\u201d) transferred to Newmark, Newmark Holdings and Newmark OpCo and their respective subsidiaries (the Newmark Group\u201d) the assets and liabilities of the BGC Group relating to BGC's Real Estate Services business, including BGC's interests in both BPF and Real Estate LP (together with the proportional distribution and assumption and repayment of indebtedness described in the following bullets, the ( Separation\u201d); \nConcurrently with the acquisition of Berkeley Point Acquisition, on September 8, 2017 Newmark invested $100.0 million in a newly formed commercial real estate-related financial and investment business, CF Real Estate Finance Holdings, L.P. ( Real Estate LP\u201d), which is controlled and managed by Cantor (as defined below). Real Estate LP may conduct activities in any real estate related business or asset backed securities-related business or any extensions thereof and ancillary activities thereto. In addition, Real Estate LP may provide short-term loans to related parties from time to time when funds in excess of amounts needed for investment are available. Newmark's investment in Real Estate LP is accounted for under the equity method.\nCantor Credit Agreement\n (1) Common stock consisted of Class A shares, Class B shares and contingent shares for which all necessary conditions have been satisfied except for the passage of time. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the weighted-average number of Class A shares was 156.2 million shares, Class B shares was 21.3 million shares and approximately 0.2 million shares of contingent Class A common stock and limited partnership units were included in our fully diluted EPS computation because the conditions for issuance had been met by the end of the period. \nShare Exchange Agreement\nLiquidity\nEmployee Loans: We have entered into various agreements with certain of our employees and partners whereby these individuals receive loans that may be either wholly or in part repaid from distributions that the individuals receive on some or all of their limited partnership interests or may be forgiven over a period of time. Cash advance distribution loans are documented in formal agreements and are repayable in timeframes outlined in the underlying agreements. We intend for these\nOther Income, Net\nIn connection with the Company's 2019 executive compensation process, the Company's executive officers received certain monetization of prior awards as compensation at Newmark, as set forth below.\nOther income of $127.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily related to the recognition of income from the receipt of Nasdaq shares of $87.2 million, as well as the mark-to-market adjustment related to the variable share forward of $19.0 million, and recognized gain of $17.9 million relating to investments carried under the measurement alternative of ASU 2016-01. Other income of $73.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily related to the recognition of income from the receipt of Nasdaq shares of $76.3 million.\nRepurchase Program\nUnit Redemptions and Exchanges - Executive Officers\nOperating, Administrative and Other\nGains from Mortgage Banking Activities/Originations, Net\nSee Note 3 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 18 - Leases\u201d to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for further information.\nOn November 30, 2018 Newmark entered into an unsecured credit agreement with Cantor. The Cantor Credit Agreement provides for each party to issue loans to the other party in the lender's discretion. Pursuant to the Cantor Credit Agreement, the parties and their respective subsidiaries (with respect to CFLP, other than BGC and its subsidiaries) may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $250.0 million from each other from time to time at an interest rate which is the higher of CFLP's or Newmark's short-term borrowing rate then in effect, plus 1.0%. As of December 31, 2019, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Cantor Credit Agreement.\nWe also use third-party service providers in the provision of its services to customers. In instances where a third-party service provider is used, Newmark performs an analysis to determine whether Newmark is acting as a principal or an agent with respect to the services provided. To the extent that Newmark determines that it is acting as a principal, the revenue and the expenses incurred are recorded on a gross basis. In instances where Newmark has determined that it is acting as an agent, the revenue and expenses are presented on a net basis within the revenue line item.\nGoodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. As prescribed in U.S. GAAP guidance, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is not amortized, but instead is periodically tested for impairment. We review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever an event occurs, or circumstances change that could reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.\nRevenues\nThe adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019 resulted in the recognition of Right-of-use ( ROU\u201d) assets of approximately $178.8 million and ROU liabilities of approximately $226.7 million, with no effect on beginning retained earnings.\nKey drivers of our revenue are producer headcount and average revenue per producer. We believe that our strong technology platform and equity and partnership structure have enabled us to use both acquisitions and recruiting to profitably increase our front-office revenue and revenue per producer, over time.\nOver the past several years, we expanded our capital markets capabilities through the strategic addition of many prolific, accomplished capital markets producers in key markets throughout the United States. We have access to many of the world's largest owners of commercial real estate, and this will drive growth throughout the life cycle of each real estate asset by allowing us to provide best-in-class agency leasing and property management during the ownership period. We also provide investment sales and arrange debt and equity financing to assist owners in maximizing the return on investment in each of their real estate assets. Specifically, with respect to multifamily assets, we are a leading GSE lender by loan origination volume and servicer with a servicing portfolio of $62.3 billion as of December 31, 2019 (of which 3.9% relates to special servicing). This servicing portfolio provides a steady stream of income over the life of the serviced loans. Additionally, we expect to see continued growth from our valuation and advisory and property management businesses, particularly in conjunction with our increasingly robust capital markets platform. In 2019, we did $81.3 billion of investment sales and debt transaction volume which was up $16.3 billion, or 25.1% over 2018.\nCertain of Newmark's agreements with Fannie Mae allow Newmark to originate and service loans under Fannie Mae's Delegated Underwriting and Servicing ( DUS\u201d) Program. These agreements require Newmark to maintain sufficient collateral to meet Fannie Mae's restricted and operational liquidity requirements based on a pre-established formula. Certain of Newmark's agreements with Freddie Mac allow Newmark to service loans under Freddie Mac's Targeted Affordable Housing ( TAH\u201d) Program. These agreements require Newmark to pledge sufficient collateral to meet Freddie Mac's liquidity requirement of 8% of the outstanding principal of TAH loans serviced by Newmark. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, Newmark has met all liquidity requirements.\nOn October 30, 2019, the Audit and Compensation Committees of the Board of Directors authorized and the Company executed the repurchase from Mr. Merkel of 55,193 shares of Newmark Class A common stock at $10.69 per share, the closing price on October 30, 2019.\nLeasing and other commission revenues increased by $37.3 million, or 4.6%, to $854.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was largely due to organic growth.\nOn December 31, 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the monetization of 1,909,188 BGC Holdings PSUs held by Mr. Gosin and 264,985 BGC Holdings PPSUs (which had an average determination price of $4.2625 per unit), which transactions had an aggregate value of $11,000,000. On February 6, 2019, the Compensation Committee approved a modification which consisted of the following: (i) the right to exchange 1,592,016 non-exchangeable HDUs (which, based on the closing price of the BGC Class A common stock of $6.20 per share on such date, had a value of $9,870,501); and (ii) the right to exchange for cash 264,985 BGC Holdings non-exchangeable PPSUs held by Mr. Gosin, (which had an average determination price of $4.2625 per unit), for a payment of $1,129,499 for taxes when (i) is exchanged. On February 22, 2019, the Compensation Committee initially approved for Mr. Gosin grants in Newmark Holdings NPSUs and NPPSUs. On April 25, 2019, the Compensation Committee modified Mr. Gosin's awards by canceling the grant of the previously mentioned Newmark Holdings NPSUs and NPPSUs and by granting non-exchangeable Newmark Holdings PSUs and PPSUs. The Committee approved this modification in order to reflect an annual compensation structure rather than a long-term NPSU/NPPSU structure.\nGrowth Drivers\nOur origination business is impacted by the lending caps imposed by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (the FHFA\u201d). On September 13, 2019, the FHFA revised its industry-wide multifamily loan purchase caps to $200.0 billion combined for the five-quarter period from the fourth quarter of 2019 to the fourth quarter of 2020. These caps on an annualized basis exceed total 2019 GSE volume of $148.5 billion and provide visibility through the end of 2020. Of the $200.0 billion, 37.5% must be loans in the affordable and underserved market segments, as well as loans that finance water and energy efficiency improvements.\n (3) For the year ended December 31, 2019, the weighted-average share count includes 84.5 million potentially anti-dilutive securities, which were excluded in the computation of fully diluted earnings per share.  Our fully diluted period-end (spot) share count for the year ended December 31, 2019 was as follows (in thousands):\nRegulatory Environment\nSee Business-Regulation\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information related to our regulatory environment.\nRestricted Stock Units: We account for equity-based compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of U.S. GAAP guidance. Restricted stock units (which we refer to as RSUs\u201d) provided to certain employees are accounted for as equity awards, and in accordance with U.S. GAAP guidance, we are required to record an expense for the portion of the RSUs that is ultimately expected to vest. Further, U.S. GAAP guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Because significant assumptions are used in estimating employee turnover and associated forfeiture rates, actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nManagement services, servicing fees and other revenue increased $45.0 million, or 7.8%, to $624.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Valuation and advisory increased $21.4 million, or 31.1%. Servicing fees increased $11.1 million (which includes a $4.1 million increase in interest income on escrow balances and a $3.5 million increase in yield maintenance fees), and interest income on loans held for sale increased $2.0 million, which was largely offset by additional interest expense on the warehouse facilities collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises.\n \u2022 the IPO; \nOther Income, Net\nFrom time to time, we may also enter into agreements with employees and partners to grant bonus and salary advances or other types of loans. These advances and loans are repayable in the timeframes outlined in the underlying agreements. In addition, we also enter into deferred compensation agreements with employees providing services to us. The costs associated with such plans are generally amortized over the period in which they vest. (See Note 30 - Compensation\u201d and Note 31 - Commitment and Contingencies\u201d, to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nGains from Mortgage Banking Activities/Originations, Net\nCertain of these limited partnership units entitle the holders to receive post-termination payments equal to the notional amount in four equal yearly installments after the holder's termination. These limited partnership units are accounted for as post-termination liability awards under U.S. GAAP guidance, which requires that Newmark record an expense for such awards based on the change in value at each reporting period and include the expense in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations as part of Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs.\u201d The liability for limited partnership units with a post-termination payout is included in Other long-term liabilities\u201d on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nThe second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated a potential impairment may exist. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one, over the estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identified intangibles. Events such as economic weakness, significant declines in operating results of reporting units, or significant changes to critical inputs of the goodwill impairment test (e.g., estimates of cash flows or cost of capital) could cause the estimated fair value of our reporting units to decline, which could result in an impairment of goodwill in the future.\nEquity Method Investments\nLiquidity\nOn December 15, 2017, Newmark announced the pricing of the IPO of 20 million shares of Newmark Class A common stock at a price to the public of $14.00 per share, which was completed on December 19, 2017. Newmark Class A shares began trading on December 15, 2017 on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol NMRK\u201d. In addition, Newmark granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 3 million shares of Newmark Class A common stock at the IPO price, less underwriting discounts and commissions. On December 26, 2017, the underwriters of the IPO exercised in full their overallotment option to purchase an additional 3 million shares of Newmark Class A common stock from Newmark at the IPO price, less underwriting discounts and commission. As a result, Newmark received aggregate net proceeds of $295.4 million from the IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. See Note 27 - Related Party Transactions\u201d to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nManagement Services, Servicing Fees and Other\nEnterprises of $762.8 million, offset by an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities of $313.0 million, an increase in ROU liabilities of $227.9 million, and an increase in long-term debt of $51.4 million.\nOn November 28, 2018, Newmark entered into a credit agreement by and among Newmark, the several financial institutions from time to time party thereto, as Lenders, and Bank of America N.A., as administrative agent (the Credit Agreement\u201d). The Credit Agreement provides for a $250.0 million three-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility\u201d). As of December 31, 2019, there was $50.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facility.\nWe have various other operating expenses. We incur leasing, equipment and maintenance expenses. We also incur selling and promotion expenses, which include entertainment, marketing and travel-related expenses. We incur communication expenses, professional and consulting fees for legal, audit and other special projects, and interest expense related to short-term operational funding needs, and notes payable and collateralized borrowings.\nIn November 2018, the Audit Committee authorized Newmark to enter into an engagement agreement with CF&Co. and its affiliates to act as financial advisor in connection with one or more third-party business combination transactions as requested by Newmark on behalf of its affiliates from time to time on specified terms, conditions and fees.\nNewmark initially recognizes and measures the rights to service mortgage loans at fair value and subsequently measures them using the amortization method. Newmark recognizes rights to service mortgage loans as separate assets at the time the underlying originated mortgage loan is sold, and the value of those rights is included in the determination of the gains on loans held for sale. Purchased MSRs, including MSRs purchased from CCRE, are initially recorded at fair value, and subsequently measured using the amortization method.\nExpenses\nAs of January 1, 2018, Newmark had an outstanding balance of $400.0 million under a committed unsecured senior revolving credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A, as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders (the Converted Term Loan\u201d). On June 19, 2018, Newmark repaid $152.9 million, and on September 26, 2018 repaid $113.2 million of the Converted Term Loan, using the proceeds from the Newmark OpCo Preferred Investments (as defined below). On November 6, 2018, Newmark repaid the remaining balance of $133.9 million with the proceeds of the 6.125% Senior Notes.\nOur growth to date has been focused in North America. As of December 31, 2019, we have more than 5,600 employees, including more than 1,800 revenue-generating producers in over 137 offices in more than 105 cities. In addition, Newmark has licensed its name to 11 commercial real estate providers that operate out of 17 offices in certain locations where Newmark does not have its own offices.\nSee Note 27 - Related Party Transactions\u201d and Note 22 - Long-Term Debt\u201d to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nGains from mortgage banking activities, net decreased by $23.7 million, or 11.5%, to $182.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by lower OMSR revenue of $17.8 million. As with other multifamily agency lenders, the Company's mix of originations, and therefore revenues, can vary depending on the size of loans, as well by the categories of loans with respect to the FHA, Freddie Mac, and different Fannie Mae structures.\nOn December 13, 2017, prior to the closing of Newmark's initial public offering ( IPO\u201d), BGC, BGC Holdings, L.P. ( BGC Holdings\u201d), BGC Partners, L.P. ( BGC U.S. OpCo\u201d), Newmark, Newmark Holdings, L.P. ( Newmark Holdings\u201d), Newmark Partners, L.P.

( CF&Co\u201d) and BGC Global Holdings, L.P. ( BGC Global OpCo\u201d) entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement (as amended on November 8, 2018 and amended and restated on November 23, 2018, the Separation and Distribution Agreement\u201d). The Separation and Distribution Agreement sets forth the agreements among BGC, Cantor, Newmark and their respective subsidiaries regarding, among other things:\nWhen reviewing goodwill for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, or if we choose to bypass the qualitative assessment, we perform a goodwill impairment analysis using a two-step process. Newmark had goodwill balances as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 of $557.9 million and $515.3 million, respectively.\n (4) Reflects interest on the $550.0 million 6.125% Senior Notes until their maturity date of November 15, 2023, in addition to the borrowings of $50.0 million assumed to be outstanding until the maturity date of the Credit Facility. Interest on the borrowings under the Credit Facility was projected using the 1-month LIBOR rate plus 200 basis points. \nCertain limited partnership units held by Newmark employees are granted exchangeability into Class A common stock or may be redeemed in connection with the grant of shares of Class A common stock. At the time exchangeability is granted, or the shares are issued, Newmark recognizes an expense based on the fair value of the award on that date, which is included in Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\n \u2022 E-commerce and supply-chain optimization has pushed industrial absorption to 39 consecutive quarters of positive net absorption, reflecting tenant and owner-user demand for warehouses and distribution centers; \nOn September 9, 2019, the U.S. Department of the Treasury issued a Housing Reform Plan (the Plan\u201d) in response to a March 27, 2019 Presidential Memorandum soliciting reforms in the housing financing system designed to minimize taxpayer exposure to future bailouts. The primary recommendations of the Plan are: (i) that existing government support for the secondary markets should be explicitly defined, tailored and paid for; (ii) that the GSEs' conservatorship should come to an end; (iii) the implementation of reforms necessary to ensure that the GSEs, and any successors, are appropriately capitalized to withstand a severe economic downturn and that shareholders and unsecured creditors, rather than U.S. taxpayers, bear the losses; (iv) that the GSEs should continue to support affordable housing at a reasonable economic return that may be less than the return earned on other activities; (v) that the FHFA and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development should clearly define the appropriate roles and overlap between the GSEs and the Federal Housing Administration so as to avoid duplication and (vi) that measures should be implemented to level the playing field\u201d between the GSEs and private sector competitors. Additionally, in September 2019, FHFA announced a cap of $200 billion as the maximum volume for combined Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac multifamily volume through the end of 2020, of which 37.5% must meet certain affordability requirements. The foregoing proposals may have the effect of impacting the volume of business that we may do with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Additionally, the potential increase in our proportion of affordable business and the potential implementation of a fee to be charged in connection with the government's offer of a guarantee may alter the economics of the business and, accordingly, may impact our financial results.\nWe derive revenues from the following general four sources:\nNewmark receives up to a 3-basis point servicing fee and/or up to a 1-basis point surveillance fee on certain Freddie Mac loans after the loan is securitized in a Freddie Mac pool ( Freddie Mac Strip\u201d). The Freddie Mac Strip is also recognized at fair value and subsequently measured using the amortization method, but is recognized as a MSR at the securitization date.\nThe following discussion of Newmark's financial condition and results of operations should be read together with Newmark's accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes, as well as the Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information\u201d relating to forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, (the Securities Act\u201d), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, (the Exchange Act\u201d), included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. When used herein, the terms Newmark Knight Frank,\u201d Newmark,\u201d the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d and our\u201d refer to Newmark and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nQUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn connection with the Company's 2018 executive compensation process, the Company's executive officers received certain monetization of prior awards as compensation at Newmark, as set forth below.\nOn December 19, 2019, the Compensation Committee approved the right to (i) convert 443,872 non-exchangeable Newmark Holdings PSUs held by Mr. Gosin into 443,872 HDUs (which, based on the closing price of the Class A common stock of $13.61 per share on such date, had a value of $5,637,548); and (ii) exchange for cash 539,080 Newmark Holdings non-exchangeable PPSUs held by Mr. Gosin (which had an average determination price of $9.95 per unit) for a payment of $5,362,452 for taxes when (i) is exchanged.\nDepreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $33.4 million, or 34.2%, to $131.1 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was due to a $23.1 million increase in mortgage servicing rights amortization and a $9.0 million increase in fixed asset depreciation, which was due to a $5.0 million asset impairment related to Newmark's restructuring plan.\n (2) Warehouse facilities are collateralized by $215.3 million of loans held for sale, at fair value (See Note 21- Warehouse Facilities Collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises\u201d to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) which loans were either under commitment to be purchased by Freddie Mac or had confirmed forward trade commitments for the issuance of and purchase of Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities. \n (2) Partnership units collectively include founding/working partner units, limited partnership units, and Cantor units, (see Note 2 - Limited Partnership Interests in Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings\u201d, to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.) In general, these partnership units are potentially exchangeable into shares of Newmark Class A common stock. In addition, partnership units held by Cantor are generally exchangeable into shares of Newmark Class A common stock and/or for up to 23.1 million shares of Newmark Class B common stock. These partnership units also generally receive quarterly allocations of net income, after the deduction of the Preferred Distribution, based on their weighted-average pro rata share of economic ownership of the operating subsidiaries. As a result, these partnership units are included in the fully diluted share count calculation shown above. \nProvision for income taxes increased by $33.0 million, or 57.4%, to $90.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily driven by the mix of allocable revenues among legal entities as a corporation versus flow through and certain return to provision adjustments, partially offset by changes in the valuation allowance. In general, our consolidated effective tax rate can vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of our earnings.\nBerkeley Point Acquisition and Investment in Real Estate LP\nContingent Payments Related to Acquisitions\nImpact of Adopting Lease Guidance\n\nRegulatory Requirements\nIn April 2019, we acquired MLG Commercial, a leading commercial real estate company offering both brokerage and property management services in Wisconsin.\nWarehouse Facilities Collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises\nAs of January 1, 2018, Newmark had an outstanding balance of $40.0 million under an unsecured senior credit agreement, which was amended and restated on March 19, 2018 ( Intercompany Credit Agreement\u201d). Through the year ended December 31, 2018, Newmark borrowed an additional $230.0 million and used these proceeds plus cash on hand to fund its restricted cash account pledged for the benefit of the Federal National Mortgage Association ( Fannie Mae\u201d). On September 4, 2018, Newmark borrowed $112.5 million in order to repay a promissory note payable to BGC of $112.5 million (the 2042 Promissory Note\u201d). On October 4, 2018, Newmark withdrew $252.0 million of cash on hand that was in excess of the minimum balance required to be pledged for the benefit of Fannie Mae to repay $252.0 million towards the outstanding balance of the Intercompany Credit Agreement. The remaining balance of $130.5 million was repaid with the proceeds of the 6.125% Senior Notes (as defined below).\nOther Operating Expenses\n \u2022 Gains from Mortgage Banking Activities/Originations, Net. Gains from mortgage banking activities/originations are derived from the origination of loans with borrowers and the sale of those loans to investors. \nRevenues\nOn March 7, 2018, BGC Partners and its operating subsidiaries purchased 16.6 million newly issued exchangeable limited partnership units (the Newmark Units\u201d) of Newmark Holdings for $242.0 million (the Investment by BGC in Newmark Holdings\u201d). See Note 27 - Related Party Transactions\u201d to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nInterest rates are also relatively low because of even lower or negative benchmark government interest rates in much of the rest of the developed world, which makes U.S. government bonds relatively more attractive.\nManagement Services, Servicing Fees and Other\nOn September 26, 2018, Newmark entered into a second agreement to issue $150.0 million of additional EPUs to RBC, similar to the June 18, 2018 transaction (together the Newmark OpCo Preferred Investment\u201d). Newmark received $113.2 million of cash with respect to this transaction.\nDebt Repayment and Credit Agreements\nvolume and a 19.9% increase in investment sales volume, both of which significantly outpaced overall industry growth volumes in the U.S.\nEquity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\nIn the past several years, Newmark has acquired approximately 50 companies. We have identified opportunities to streamline our operations and complete the integration of these various businesses. We believe the result of these actions will generate in excess of $20 million of annualized savings by the end of 2020, of which $15 million were achieved in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nThe key drivers of revenue growth for U.S. commercial real estate services companies include the overall health of the U.S. economy, institutional ownership of commercial real estate as an investible asset class, and the ability to attract and retain talent. In addition, growth in our capital markets business is driven by the availability of credit to purchasers of and investors in commercial real estate. In our multifamily business, delayed marriages, an aging population and less home ownership are driving increased demand for new apartments, with an estimated 4.6 million needed by 2030, according to a 2017 study commissioned by the National Multifamily Housing Council and the National Apartment Association. This should continue to drive investment sales, GSE multifamily lending and other mortgage brokerage and growth in our servicing portfolio for the foreseeable future. According to RealPage, developers are expected to deliver 370 thousand new apartments in 2020, up 50% from 247 thousand in 2019.\nNewmark has an investment in Real Estate LP, a joint venture with Cantor in which Newmark has a less than majority ownership and has the ability to exert significant influence over the operating and financial policies. As of December 31, 2019, Newmark had $100.0 million in this equity method investment, which represents a 27% ownership in Real Estate LP.\nDiscretionary Bonus: A portion of our compensation and employee benefits expense comprises discretionary bonuses, which may be paid in cash, equity, partnership awards or a combination thereof. We accrue expense in a period based on revenues in that period and on the expected combination of cash, equity and partnership units. Given the assumptions used in estimating discretionary bonuses, actual results may differ.\nBased on the number of shares of BGC common stock outstanding as of the close of business on the Record Date, BGC's stockholders as of the Record Date received in the Spin-Off 0.463895 of a share of Newmark Class A common stock for each share of BGC Class A common stock held as of the Record Date, and 0.463895 of a share of Newmark Class B common stock for each share of BGC Class B common stock held as of the Record Date. BGC Partners stockholders received cash in lieu of any fraction of a share of Newmark common stock that they otherwise would have received in the Spin-Off.\nThe following table details our share repurchase activity during 2019, including the total number of shares purchased, the average price paid per share, the number of shares repurchased as part of our publicly announced repurchase program and the approximate value that may yet be purchased under such program (in thousands except share and per share amounts):\nAs of January 1, 2018, Newmark had an outstanding balance of $300.0 million principal amount promissory note payable to BGC U.S. OpCo (the 2019 Promissory Note\u201d). On November 23, 2018, Newmark OpCo repaid the $300.0 million outstanding principal amount under the 2019 Promissory Note, primarily using proceeds from the sale of its 6.125% Senior Notes. Upon repayment of the 2019 Promissory Note, Newmark had no further debt obligations owed to or guaranteed by BGC, which was one of the requirements for the Spin-Off to be tax-free.\nThe Spin-Off\nIn January 2019, we filed a registration statement on Form S-4 pursuant to which the holders of our 6.125% Senior Notes which were issued in a private placement were offered an opportunity to exchange such notes for new registered notes with substantially identical terms. The registration statement was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and, on February 5, 2019, we announced an offer to exchange up to all $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6.125% Senior Notes for an equivalent amount of 6.125% Senior Notes registered under the Securities Act. The exchange offer closed on March 14, 2019, and the 6.125% Senior Notes were subsequently exchanged for notes with substantially similar terms that were registered under the Securities Act.\nNewmark entered into four variable postpaid forward contracts as a result of the Nasdaq Forwards. These contracts qualify as derivative financial instruments. The Nasdaq Forwards provide Newmark with the ability to redeem the EPUs for Nasdaq stock, and as these instruments are not legally detachable, they represent single financial instruments. The financial instruments' EPU redemption feature for Nasdaq common stock is not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of Newmark's EPU equity host instruments, and, therefore, it represents an embedded derivative that is required to be bifurcated and recorded at fair value on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets, with all changes in fair value recorded as a component of Other income (loss), net\u201d on our accompanying consolidated statements of operations. See Note 11 - Derivatives\u201d, to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nWe have entered into various agreements with certain of our employees and partners whereby these individuals receive loans, which may be either wholly or in part repaid from the distribution earnings that the individual receives on their limited partnership interests in BGC Holdings and Newmark Holdings. The forgivable portion of these loans is recognized as compensation expense over the life of the loan.\nNewmark granted conversion rights on outstanding limited partnership units in Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings to Newmark employees to convert the limited partnership units to a capital balance within Newmark Holdings or BGC Holdings. Generally, HDUs are not considered share-equivalent limited partnership units and are not in the fully diluted share count.\nPre-IPO Related Party Items\nDepreciation and Amortization\nAs of December 31, 2019, our liquidity, which Newmark defines as cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities, less securities loaned, was $163.6 million. This does not include the approximately $638.0 million in additional Nasdaq stock (stock value based on the February 12, 2020 closing price) that Newmark expects to receive between 2020 and 2027. Newmark expects to use its considerable financial resources to repay debt, profitably hire, make accretive acquisitions, pay dividends, and/or repurchase shares and units of Newmark, all while maintaining or improving its credit profile.\nAccording to Real Capital Analytics ( RCA\u201d), prices for commercial real estate were up by approximately 8% year-over-year for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year, overall U.S. commercial real estate notional sales volumes decreased by approximately 2%. In comparison, our investment sales volumes increased 19.9% year-over-year in 2019. According to a January 2020 Mortgage Bankers Association ( MBA\u201d) forecast, originations of commercial/multifamily loans of all types are projected to increase approximately 9% in terms of dollar volume for each of the years ending December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020. Our mortgage brokerage volumes were up 47.6% year-over-year in 2019 and our total debt volumes were up 34.7% to over $30 billion in 2019.\nLong-term debt consisted of the following (in thousands):\nOn September 8, 2017, BGC Partners, Inc. ( BGC\u201d or BGC Partners\u201d) acquired, from Cantor Commercial Real Estate Company, LP ( CCRE\u201d), 100% of the equity of Berkeley Point Financial LLC (the Berkeley Point Acquisition\u201d). Berkeley Point Financial LLC ( Berkeley Point\u201d or BPF\u201d) is a leading commercial real estate finance company focused on the origination and sale of multifamily and other commercial real estate loans through government-sponsored and government-funded loan programs, as well as the servicing of commercial real estate loans. On December 13, 2017, in connection with the Separation from BGC, the assets and liabilities of Berkeley Point were transferred to Newmark. See Note 27 - Related Party Transactions\u201d to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nCompensation and employee benefits expense increased by $114.0 million, or 9.8%, to $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The main driver of this increase was Newmark's continued hiring of leading industry professionals.\nWe pay fees to BGC Partners and/or Cantor for performing certain administrative and other support, including charges for occupancy of office space, utilization of fixed assets and accounting, operations, human resources, legal services and technology infrastructure support. Management believes that these charges are a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services rendered. However, the expenses for these services are not necessarily indicative of the expenses that would have been incurred if we had not obtained these services from BGC Partners or Cantor. In addition, these charges may not reflect the costs of services we may receive from BGC Partners or Cantor in the future.\nOn December 19, 2019, the Compensation Committee approved the right to (i) convert 552,483 non-exchangeable Newmark Holdings PSUs held by Mr. Lutnick into 552,483 HDUs (which, based on the closing price of the Class A common stock of $13.61 per share on such date, had a value of $7,017,000); and (ii) exchange for cash 602,463 Newmark Holdings non-exchangeable PPSUs held by Mr. Lutnick (which had an average determination price of $13.25 per unit)for a payment of $7,983,000 for taxes when (i) is exchanged.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated $853.6 million of cash from operations. We had net income of $145.1 million, $705.1 million of adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities, and $3.4 million of positive changes in operating assets and liabilities. $711.4 million of adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities was related to loans held for sale. The positive change in operating assets and liabilities was driven by a $58.9 million increase in our accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, including accrued compensation, and a $36.1 increase in other assets, partially offset by a $91.5 million negative change in operating assets and liabilities as a result of an increase in outstanding receivables and employee loans and other receivables. We generated $0.4 million of cash provided by investing activities primarily related to proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, offset by purchases of fixed assets. We used $798.2 million of cash from financing activities primarily due to net payments to related parties of $746.9 million, $101.8 million of distribution of earnings to BGC and $89.1 million distribution related to Berkeley Point acquisition, offset by $57.6 million of proceeds from secured loans.\nInterest (Expense) Income, Net\n (1) Operating leases are related to rental payments under various non-cancelable leases principally for office space. \nThe following table summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2019 (in thousands):\nThe discussion of our financial results reflects only the business owned by us and does not include the results for Knight Frank or for the independently owned offices that use some variation of the Newmark name in their branding or marketing.\nLimited Partnership Units: Limited partnership units in Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings are held by Newmark employees and receive quarterly allocations of net income and are generally contingent upon services being provided by the unit holders. As discussed above, preferred units in Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings are not entitled to participate in partnership distributions other than with respect to a distribution at a rate of either 0.6875% (which is 2.75% per calendar year) or such other amount as set forth in the award documentation. The quarterly allocations of net income to such limited partnership units are reflected as a component of compensation expense under Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nOn November 30, 2018, BGC completed the Spin-Off to its stockholders of all of the shares of the Newmark common stock owned by BGC as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Spin-Off, with shares of Newmark Class A common stock distributed to the holders of shares of BGC Class A common stock (including directors and executive officers of BGC Partners) of record as of the close of business on November 23, 2018 (the Record Date\u201d), and shares of Newmark Class B common stock distributed to the holders of shares of BGC's Class B common stock (consisting of Cantor and CF Group Management, Inc. ( CFGM\u201d) of record as of the close of business on the Record Date).\nFees are generally earned when a lease is signed. In many cases, landlords are responsible for paying the fees. In capital markets, fees are earned and recognized when the sale of a property closes, and title passes from seller to buyer for investment sales and when debt or equity is funded to a vehicle for debt and equity transactions. Gains from mortgage banking activities/originations, net are recognized when a derivative asset is recorded upon the commitment to originate a loan with a borrower and sell the loan to an investor. The derivative is recorded at fair value and includes loan origination fees, sales premiums and the estimated fair value of the expected net servicing cash flows. Gains from mortgage banking activities/originations, net are recognized net of related fees and commissions to affiliates or third-party brokers. For loans we broker, revenues are recognized when the loan is closed. Servicing fees are recognized on an accrual basis over the lives of the related mortgage loans. We typically receive monthly management fees based upon a percentage of monthly rental income generated from the property under management, or in some cases, the greater of such percentage or a minimum agreed upon fee. We are often reimbursed for our administrative and payroll costs, as well as certain out-of-pocket expenses, directly attributable to properties under management. We follow accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or U.S. GAAP\u201d, which provides guidance when accounting for reimbursements from clients and when accounting for certain contingent events for Leasing and Capital Markets transactions. See Note 3 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion.\n \u2022 Capital Markets. Our real estate capital markets business specializes in the arrangement of acquisitions and dispositions of commercial properties, as well as providing other financial services, including the arrangement of debt and equity financing, and loan sale advisory. \nNewmark's income taxes as presented are calculated on a separate return basis for the periods prior to the Spin-Off and have historically been included in BGC's U.S. federal and state tax returns or separate non-U.S. jurisdictions tax returns. Subsequent to the spin, Newmark will file its own stand-alone tax returns for its operations within these jurisdictions. The 2018 tax results reflect both the pre and post spin periods and as such Newmark's tax results as presented are not necessarily reflective of the results that Newmark would have generated on a stand-alone basis.\n6.125% Senior Notes\nDepreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $1.9 million, or 2.0%, to $97.7 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was due to a $5.9 million increase in mortgage servicing rights amortization and $1.4 million increase in fixed asset depreciation, partially offset by lower intangible asset amortization of $5.4 million.\nSee Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d herein for information related to our liquidity and capital resources.\nMSRs, Net\nIn September 2019, the SPV notified RBC of its decision to settle the first variable postpaid forward contract using the Nasdaq common stock the SPV received in November 2019 in exchange for the first tranche of the EPUs, which resulted in a payable to RBC that was settled upon receipt of Nasdaq earn-out shares. The fair value of the Nasdaq common stock that Newmark received was $98.6 million. As a result of Newmark's settlement election, Newmark reclassified $93.5 million of EPUs from \"Noncontrolling interest\" to \"Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities\" on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. On December 2, 2019, Newmark settled the first variable postpaid forward contract with 898,685 Nasdaq common stock shares, with a fair value of $93.5 million and Newmark retained 93,562 Nasdaq common stock shares. The fair value of the Nasdaq common stock held by Newmark, as of December 31, 2019 was $36.8 million and is included in Marketable securities\u201d on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\n\nImpact of Adopting Revenue Recognition Guidance\nFees to related parties decreased by $1.1 million, or 4.3%, to $25.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\n \u2022 Continued corporate employment growth, combined with increased leisure travel, generated demand for hotel room-nights.  Rising inflation and interest rates, which are byproducts of faster economic growth, could deliver a mixed outcome: potentially higher interest rates could put upward pressure on cap rates, but stronger rent growth and sustained investor demand could support higher property values and income growth.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nExchangeable Preferred Partnership Units and Forward Contracts\nYear ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017\nRestricted Stock: Restricted stock provided to certain employees is accounted for as an equity award, and as per U.S. GAAP guidance, we are required to record an expense for the portion of the restricted stock that is ultimately expected to vest. We have granted restricted stock that is not subject to continued employment or service; however, transferability is subject to compliance with our and our affiliates' customary non-compete obligations. Such shares of restricted stock are generally saleable by partners in 5 to 10 years. Because the restricted stock is not subject to continued employment or service, the grant-date fair value of the restricted stock is expensed on the date of grant. The expense is reflected as non-cash equity-based compensation expense in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nOn November 28, 2018, Newmark entered into a Credit Agreement by and among Newmark, the several financial institutions from time to time party thereto, as Lenders, and Bank of America N.A., as administrative agent. The Credit Agreement provides for a $250.0 million three-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2019, there were $50.0 of million borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the Credit Facility will bear an annual interest equal to, at Newmark's option, either (a) London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) for specified periods, or upon the consent of all Lenders, such other period that is 12 months or less, plus an applicable margin, or (b) a base rate equal to the greatest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, (ii) the prime rate as established by the administrative agent, and (iii) one-month LIBOR plus 1.0%. The applicable margin is 200 basis points with respect to LIBOR borrowings in (a) above and can range 0.25% to 1.25% higher, depending upon Newmark's credit rating. The Credit Facility also provides for an unused facility fee.\nWe generate revenues from commissions on leasing and capital markets transactions, consulting and technology user fees, property and facility management fees, and mortgage origination and loan servicing fees.\nLeasing and Other Commissions\nNewmark is a fast growing, full-service commercial real estate services business. We offer a diverse array of integrated services and products designed to meet the full needs of both real estate investors/owners and occupiers. Our investor/owner services and products include capital markets, which consists of investment sales, debt and structured finance and loan sales, agency leasing, property management, valuation and advisory, commercial real estate due diligence consulting and advisory services and government sponsored enterprise ( GSE\u201d) lending and loan servicing, mortgage broking and equity-raising. Our occupier services and products include tenant representation, real estate management technology systems, workplace and occupancy strategy, global corporate consulting services, project management, lease administration and facilities management. We enhance these services and products through innovative real estate technology solutions and data analytics that enable our clients to increase their efficiency and profits by optimizing their real estate portfolio. We have relationships with many of the world's largest commercial property owners, real estate developers and investors, as well as Fortune 500 and Forbes Global 2000 companies. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated revenues of $2.2 billion representing year-over-year growth of 8.3%.\nincluded in our fully diluted share count. The quarterly allocations of net income on Preferred Units are also reflected in compensation expense under Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations. After deduction of the Preferred Distribution, the remaining partnership units generally receive quarterly allocation of net income based on their weighted-average pro rata share of economic ownership of the operating subsidiaries. In addition, Preferred Units are granted in connection with the grant of certain limited partnership units, such as PSUs, that may be granted exchangeability to cover the withholding taxes owed by the unit holder upon such exchange. This is an acceptable alternative to the common practice among public companies of issuing the gross amount of shares to employees, subject to cashless withholding of shares to pay applicable withholding taxes.\nCredit Rating\nIn relation to the IPO, on December 13, 2017, Newmark entered into an exchange agreement with Cantor, CFGM, BGC and other Cantor affiliates entitled to hold Class B common stock, providing the right to exchange from time to time shares of Class A common stock of Newmark now owned or hereafter acquired, as applicable, on a one-for-one basis for shares of Class B common stock, up to the number of shares of Newmark Class B common stock that are authorized but unissued under Newmark's certificate of incorporation. The Newmark Audit Committee and Board of Directors have determined that the exchange agreement is in the best interests of Newmark and its stockholders because, among other things, it will help ensure that Cantor retains its exchangeable limited partnership units in Newmark Holdings, which is the same partnership in which Newmark's partner employees participate, thus continuing to align the interests of Cantor with those of the partner employees.\nDuring 2019, our headcount grew 8%. During 2018 and 2019 we hired over 100 top producers to the platform with average annual production in excess of $2.0 million. Based on their strong track record of revenue generation, we expect these new hires will help us achieve our growth and productivity targets over the coming years. As we continue to generate a higher percentage of our revenues from recurring businesses, we no longer plan to highlight our broker productivity metric beginning in 2020. This is consistent with our full service peers.\nOn February 26, 2020, Newmark entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement (the Amended Credit Agreement\u201d), increasing the size of the Credit Facility to $425.0 million ( the Amended Credit Facility\u201d) and extending the maturity date to February 26, 2023. The interest rate on the Amended Credit Facility is LIBOR plus 1.75% per annum, subject to a pricing grid linked to Newmark's credit ratings from Standard & Poor's and Fitch.\nThe U.S. economy expanded by 2.3% during 2019, according to a preliminary estimate from the U.S. Department of Commerce. This growth compares with an increase of 2.9% during 2018. The consensus is for U.S. gross domestic product to expand by 1.8% in 2020 and 1.9% in 2021, according to a recent Bloomberg survey of economists. This moderate pace of growth should help keep interest rates and inflation low by historical standards.\nthan leasing advisory transactions, while leasing advisory revenues are generally more predictable than revenues from capital markets. Property and facilities management, along with certain of our other Global Corporate Services ( GCS\u201d) products, generally have the most predictable and steady revenues, although pre-tax earnings margins for property and facilities management are at the lower end of those for our business as a whole. When management services clients agree to give us exclusive rights to provide real estate services for their facilities or properties, it is for an extended period, which provides us with stable and foreseeable sources of revenues. Newmark's revenues are balanced between businesses that are relatively less predictable and contractual sources that are very predictable. Approximately 67% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 were generated by our most predictable and highly visible sources, including agency leasing, valuation, GCS, management services, loan servicing and tenant representation leasing business. The remaining 33% of revenues were generated by our more transactional investment sales, mortgage brokerage, and GSE lending platforms. Despite being more transactional, there are $2.1 trillion of mortgage maturities between 2020 and 2024 which we believe will support strong levels of mortgage brokerage and origination activities. Our debt volume increased by 34.7% year-on-year to $30.6 billion in 2019.\nIn December 2017, prior to our Separation and IPO, all intercompany arrangements and agreements that were previously approved by the Audit Committee of BGC Partners with respect to BGC Partners and its subsidiaries and Cantor and its subsidiaries were also approved by our Board of Directors with respect to the relationships between us and our subsidiaries and Cantor and its subsidiaries following our IPO on the terms and conditions approved by the BGC Audit Committee during such time that our business was owned by BGC Partners. These arrangements include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) an authorization to provide Cantor real estate and related services, including real estate advice, brokerage, property or facilities management, appraisals and valuations and other services; (ii) an authorization to enter into brokerage and similar agreements with respect to the provision of ordinary course brokerage services in circumstances in which such entities customarily provide brokerage services to third-party customers; (iii) an authorization to enter into agreements with Cantor and/or its affiliates, to provide services, including finding and reviewing suitable acquisition or partner candidates, structuring transactions and negotiating and due diligence services in connection with acquisitions and other business strategies in commercial real estate and other businesses from time to time; and (iv) an arrangement to jointly manage exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates. Please see the section entitled Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\u201d in BGC Partners' Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A for its 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders filed on April 29, 2019 for a description of these and other approved arrangements.\nNewmark has a stand-alone BBB- stable credit rating from Fitch Ratings, Inc. and Kroll Bond Rating Agency, as well as a BB+ stable rating from Standard & Poor's.\nIn connection with the expansion of our mortgage brokerage and lending activities, Newmark has entered into an agreement with Cantor pursuant to which five former employees of its affiliate, CCRE, have transferred to Newmark, effective as of May 1, 2018. In connection with this transfer of employees, Cantor paid $6.9 million to Newmark in October 2018 and Newmark Holdings issued $6.7 million of limited partnership units and $0.2 million of cash in the form of a cash distribution agreement to the employees. In addition, Newmark Holdings issued $2.2 million of Newmark Holdings partnership units with a\n (5) Interest on the warehouse facilities collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises was projected by using the 1-month LIBOR rate plus their respective additional basis points, primarily 115 basis points above LIBOR, applied to their respective outstanding balances as of December 31, 2019, through their respective maturity dates. Their respective maturity dates range from June 2020 to October 2020, while one line has an open maturity date. The notional amount of these committed and uncommitted warehouse facilities was $1.8 billion at December 31, 2019. One warehouse facility, with an initial notional amount of $450.0 million, was temporarily increased by $350.0 million to $800.0 million for the period January 13, 2020 to March 30, 2020. Another warehouse facility, with an initial notional amount of $400.0 million, was temporarily increased by $100.0 million to $500.0 million for the period January 29, 2020 to March 13, 2020.  As of December 31, 2019, Newmark was committed to fund approximately $1.5 billion, which is the total remaining draws on construction loans originated by Newmark under the Housing and Urban Development ( HUD\u201d) 221(d)4, 220 and 232 programs, rate locked loans that have not been funded, and forward commitments, as well as the funding for Fannie Mae\nOther income, net is comprised of the gains associated with the Earn-out shares related to the Nasdaq transaction and the movements related to the impact of any unrealized non-cash mark-to-market gains or losses related to the Nasdaq Forwards. Additionally, other income includes gains (losses) on equity method investments which represent our pro rata share of the net gains (losses) on investments over which we have significant influence but which we do not control, and the mark-to-market gains or losses on the non-marketable investments accounted for pursuant to the measurement alternative under Accounting Standards Update 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.\nThe primary source of liquidity for our business is the cash flow provided by our operations.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\ninvestment in Newmark, net proceeds from 6.125% Senior Notes of $537.5 million, $262.2 million proceeds from the Newmark OpCo Preferred Investment, partially offset by distributions to limited partnership interests and noncontrolling interests of $46.5 million, and dividends of $41.8 million, and $1,156.0 million repayment of long-term debt.\nNewmark is subject to various capital requirements in connection with seller/servicer agreements that Newmark has entered into with the various GSEs. Failure to maintain minimum capital requirements could result in Newmark's inability to originate and service loans for the respective GSEs and could have a direct material adverse effect on our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2019, Newmark has met all capital requirements. As of December 31, 2019, the most restrictive capital requirement was Fannie Mae's net worth requirement. Newmark exceeded the minimum requirement by $299.9 million.\nWe continue to invest in the business by adding high profile and talented producers and other revenue-generating professionals. Historically, newly hired commercial real estate producers tend to achieve dramatically higher productivity in their second and third years with our company, although we incur related expenses immediately. As our newly hired producers increase their production, we expect our commission revenue and earnings growth to accelerate, thus reflecting our operating leverage. Our pre-tax margins are impacted by the mix of revenues generated. For example, servicing revenues tend to have higher pre-tax margins than Newmark as a whole and margins from Gains from mortgage banking activities/originations, net\u201d tend to be lower as we retain rights to service loans over time. In addition, capital markets, which includes sales, commercial mortgage broking, and other real estate-related financial services, generally has larger transactions that occur with less frequency and visibility when compared with leasing advisory. Capital markets transactions tend to have higher pre-tax margins\nOn January 1, 2019, Newmark adopted ASC 842 Leases ( ASC 842\u201d), which provides guidance on the accounting and disclosure for accounting for leases. Newmark has elected the optional transition method, and pursuant to this transition method, financial information will not be updated and the disclosures required under the new standard will not be provided for dates and periods prior to January 1, 2019. Newmark has elected the package of practical expedients,\u201d which permits Newmark not to reassess under the new standard its prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. Newmark has elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify, and has elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all leases other than real estate leases.\nDepreciation and Amortization\n (1) Amounts include the gains related to the Nasdaq Earn-out associated with the Nasdaq monetization transactions recorded in Other income (loss), net.  Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOn December 19, 2019, the Audit and Compensation Committees of the Board of Directors authorized and the Company executed the repurchase from Mr. Merkel of 132,429 shares of Newmark Class A common stock at $13.61 per share, the closing price on December 19, 2019.\nOn November 6, 2018, Newmark closed its offering of $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Senior Notes due 2023 ( 6.125% Senior Notes\u201d). The 6.125% Senior Notes are general senior unsecured obligations of Newmark. The 6.125% Senior Notes, which were priced on November 1, 2018 at 98.937% to yield 6.375%, were offered and sold by Newmark in a private offering exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act. Newmark received net proceeds of $537.6 million, net of debt issue costs and debt discount. The 6.125% Senior Notes bear an interest rate of 6.125% per annum, payable on each May 15 and November 15, beginning on May 15, 2019 and will mature on November 15, 2023. Newmark used the net proceeds to repay the remaining balance of the Converted Term Loan of $133.9 million, the balance of\n(1)The components of Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs are as follows (in thousands): \nAs of January 1, 2018, Newmark had an outstanding balance of $270.7 million under a committed unsecured senior term loan credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders. The term loan credit agreement provided for loans of up to $575.0 million (the Term Loan\u201d). Newmark used the proceeds of the Investment in Newmark Holdings plus cash on hand to repay in full the Term Loan.\nOn June 18, 2018, Newmark's principal operating subsidiary, Newmark OpCo, issued $175.0 million of exchangeable preferred partnership units ( EPUs\u201d) in a private transaction to the Royal Bank of Canada ( RBC\u201d). Newmark received $152.9 million of cash with respect to this transaction.\nOther Income, Net\nLeasing and other commission revenues increased by $200.5 million, or 32.5%, to $817.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was due to organic growth.\nLeasing and Other Commissions\nSeparation and Distribution and Related Agreements\nCertain of these limited partnership units entitle the holders to receive post-termination payments. These limited partnership units are accounted for as post-termination liability awards under U.S. GAAP guidance, which requires that we record an expense for such awards based on the change in value at each reporting period and include the expense in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations as part of Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d. The liability for limited partnership units with a post-termination payout amount is included in Other long-term liabilities\u201d on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nRegistration Statements\nBecause the Company recognizes OMSR gains equal to the fair value of servicing rights retained on mortgage loans originated and sold, it also amortizes MSRs in proportion to the net servicing revenue expected to be earned. Subsequent to the initial recording, MSRs are amortized and carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. For the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our expenses included $78.4 million and $72.5 million of MSR amortization, respectively.\n\nCredit Facility\nthe Intercompany Credit Agreement of $130.5 million, and a portion of the 2019 Promissory Note (as defined below). The 6.125% Senior Notes were subsequently exchanged for notes with substantially similar terms that were registered under the Securities Act. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the carrying amount of the 6.125% Senior Notes was $540.4 million and $537.9 million, respectively.\nCompensation and Employee Benefits\nFees to Related Parties\n (1) Includes payments for corporate taxes in the amounts of $95.1 million, $1.2 million and $0.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. \n \u2022 the BGC Holdings distribution; and \nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606\u201d), which provides accounting guidance on the recognition of revenues from contracts with customers and impacts the presentation of certain revenues and expenses in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Newmark elected to adopt ASC 606 using a modified retrospective approach with regard to contracts that were not completed as of December 31, 2017, and prospectively from January 1, 2018 onward. Due to the adoption of ASC 606, for all periods from the first quarter of 2018 onward, Newmark did not and will not record revenues or earnings related to Leasing and other commissions\u201d with respect to contingent revenue expected to be received in future periods as of December 31, 2017, in relation to contracts signed prior to January 1, 2018, for which services have already been completed. Instead, Newmark recorded this contingent revenue and related commission payments on the balance sheet on January 1, 2018, with a corresponding pre-tax improvement of $22.7 million and Newmark recognized an increase of $16.5 million and $2.3 million to beginning retained earnings and noncontrolling interests, respectively, as a cumulative effect of adoption of an accounting change.\nA portion of our gains from mortgage banking activities, net, relate to non-cash gains attributable to OMSRs. We recognize OMSR gains equal to the fair value of servicing rights retained on mortgage loans originated and sold. For the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recognized $103.2 million and $121.0 million of non-cash gains, respectively, related to OMSRs.\nIn addition, as a servicer for Fannie Mae, the Government National Mortgage Association ( Ginnie Mae\u201d) and FHA, Newmark is required to advance to investors any uncollected principal and interest due from borrowers. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, outstanding borrower advances were $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively, and are included in Other assets\u201d in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nBoth the commitment to extend credit and the forward sale commitment qualify as derivative financial instruments. We recognize all derivatives on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities measured at fair value. The change in the derivatives fair value is recognized in current period earnings.\nCapital Markets\nFinancial Overview\nIn June 2019, we completed the acquisition of ACRES, a commercial brokerage and management firm headquartered in Utah. ACRES operates offices in Salt Lake City, Utah; Boise, Idaho; and Reno, Nevada.\nFees to Related Parties\nTransfer of Employees to Newmark and Other Related Party Transactions\n \u2022 the pro rata distribution in the Spin-Off of the shares of Newmark Class A common stock and the shares of Newmark Class B common stock held by BGC, pursuant to which shares of Newmark Class A common stock held by BGC would be distributed to the holders of shares of BGC Class A common stock and shares of Newmark Class B common stock held by BGC would be distributed to the holders of shares of BGC Class B common stock. The Spin-Off distribution is intended to qualify as generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  As part of the Separation described above, BGC contributed its interests in BPF and Real Estate L.P. to Newmark.\nWe incur income tax expenses based on the location, legal structure, and jurisdictional taxing authorities of each of our subsidiaries. Certain of the Company's entities are taxed as U.S. partnerships and are subject to the Unincorporated Business Tax (which we refer to as UBT\u201d) in New York City. U.S. federal and state income tax liability or benefit related to the partnership income or loss, with the exception of UBT, rests with the partners (See Note 2 - Limited Partnership Interests in Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings\u201d, to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.) rather than the partnership entity. Our accompanying consolidated financial statements include U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on the Company's allocable share of the U.S. results of operations. Outside of the U.S., we operate principally through subsidiary corporations subject to local income taxes.\nA portion of our gains from mortgage banking activities, net, relate to non-cash gains attributable to OMSRs. We recognize OMSR gains equal to the fair value of servicing rights retained on mortgage loans originated and sold. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recognized $109.2 million and $103.2 million of non-cash gains, respectively, related to OMSRs. As with originations, OMSR gains are also impacted by the product mix.\nThe ten-year Treasury yield declined by approximately 77 basis points to 1.92% as of December 31, 2019 versus the year-earlier date. Ten-year Treasury yields have remained well below their 50-year average of approximately 6.32% due to market expectations that the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC\u201d) will lower the federal funds rate over the next year in addition to muted long-term inflation expectations. On October 30, 2019, the FOMC reduced the target range for the federal funds rate to between 1.50% and 1.75%.\nWe derive our revenues primarily through commissions from brokerage services, gains from mortgage banking activities/originations, net, revenues from real estate management services, servicing fees and other revenues. Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when, or as, Newmark satisfies its performance obligations by transferring the promised goods or services to the customers as determined by when, or as, the customer obtains control of that good or service. A performance obligation may be satisfied over time or at a point in time. Revenue from a performance obligation satisfied over time is recognized by measuring Newmark's progress in satisfying the performance obligation as evidenced by the transfer of the goods or services to the customer. Revenue from a performance obligation satisfied at a point in time is recognized at the point in time when the customer obtains control over the promised good or service. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those promised goods or services (i.e., the transaction price\u201d). In determining the transaction price, we consider consideration promised in a contract that includes a variable amount, referred to as variable consideration, and estimate the amount of consideration due Newmark. Additionally, variable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. In determining when to include variable consideration in the transaction price, Newmark considers all information (historical, current and forecast) that is available, including the range of possible outcomes, the predictive value of past experiences, the time period of when uncertainties expect to be resolved and the amount of consideration that is susceptible to factors outside of Newmark's influence.\nOn December 31, 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the monetization of 898,080 BGC Holdings, PPSUs held by Mr. Lutnick (which had an average determination price of $7.65 per unit), and 592,721 Newmark Holdings PPSUs (which had an average determination price of $13.715 per unit), which transactions had an aggregate value of $15,000,000. On February 6, 2019, the Compensation Committee approved a modification which consisted of the following: (i) the right to exchange 1,131,774 non-exchangeable BGC Holdings PSUs held by Mr. Lutnick into 1,131,774 HDUs (which, based on the closing price of the BGC Class A common stock of $6.20 per share on such date, had a value of $7,017,000); and (ii) the right to exchange for cash 1,018,390 BGC Holdings non-exchangeable PPSUs held by Mr. Lutnick, (which had an average determination price of $7.8388 per unit), for a payment of $7,983,000 for taxes when (i) is exchanged.\nCash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nOn November 30, 2018, BGC Partners also caused its subsidiary, BGC Holdings, to distribute pro rata (the BGC Holdings distribution\u201d) all of the 1,458,931 exchangeable limited partnership units of Newmark Holdings held by BGC Holdings immediately prior to the effective time of the BGC Holdings distribution to its limited partners entitled to receive distributions on their BGC Holdings units (including Cantor and executive officers of BGC) who were holders of record of such units as of the Record Date. The Newmark Holdings units distributed to BGC Holdings partners in the BGC Holdings distribution are exchangeable for shares of Newmark Class A common stock, and in the case of the 449,917 Newmark Holdings units received by Cantor also into shares of Newmark Class B common stock, at the applicable exchange ratio (subject to\nTotal liabilities at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $2,239.4 million and $2,371.2 million, respectively. The decrease of $131.8 million can be attributed to a decrease in warehouse facilities collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored\nNewmark provides for uncertain tax positions based upon management's assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. Management is required to determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Because significant assumptions are used in determining whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities, actual results may differ from Newmark's estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Newmark recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in Provision for income taxes\u201d in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated $986.8 million of cash from operations. However, excluding activity from loan originations and sales, net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $211.2 million. We had consolidated net income of $161.7 million, $222.6 million of positive adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash used by operating activities (excluding activity from loan originations and sales) and $173.1 million of negative changes in operating assets and liabilities. The negative change in operating assets and liabilities included $161.9 million of increases in loans, forgivable loans and other receivables from employees and partners primarily related to continued hiring and expansion of our business, $113.2 million of increases in other assets, and $52.0 million of increase in receivables, net, offset by an increase of $130.7 million in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities and an increase of $23.4 million in payables to related parties. Cash used in investing activities was $56.8 million, primarily related to $34.5 million in purchases of fixed assets, $33.9 million of payments for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, $28.0 million in purchases of non-marketable investments, net, partially offset by $32.6 million of proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, and $8.6 million of distributions from Real Estate L.P. We used $895.5 million of cash from financing activities primarily due to net repayments on the warehouse facilities collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises of $762.7 million, distributions to limited partnership interests and other noncontrolling interests of $140.6 million, dividends to stockholders of $69.2 million and treasury stock repurchases of $37.4 million, partially offset by net borrowings under the Credit Facility of $50.0 million, the settlement of pre-Spin-Off related party receivables of $33.9 million, and proceeds from securities loaned of $36.7 million.\nGains from mortgage banking activities, net increased by $15.8 million, or 8.7%, to $198.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in GSE loan origination volume of $1.4 billion, or 16.1%, to $9.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. As with other multifamily agency lenders, Newmark's mix of originations, and therefore revenues, can vary depending on the size of loans, as well by the categories of loans with respect to the FHA, Freddie Mac, and different Fannie Mae structures.\nWe have invested significantly to capitalize on the current business environment through acquisitions, technology spending and the hiring of new producers, salespeople, managers and other front-office personnel. The business climate for these acquisitions has been competitive, and it is expected that these conditions will persist for the foreseeable future. We have been able to attract businesses and producers, salespeople, managers and other front-office personnel to our platform as we believe they recognize that we have the scale, technology, experience and expertise to succeed in the current business environment.

The Cantor Credit Agreement provides for each party to issue loans to the other party in the lender's discretion. Pursuant to the Cantor Credit Agreement, the parties and their respective subsidiaries (with respect to CFLP, other than BGC and its subsidiaries) may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $250.0 million from each other from time to time at an interest rate which is the higher of Cantor's or the Company's short-term borrowing rate then in effect, plus 1.0%.\nThis discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations and financial condition during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.

The total consideration received in the transaction included $750.0 million in cash paid upon closing and an Earn-out of up to 14,883,705 shares of Nasdaq common stock to be paid ratably over 15 years, provided that Nasdaq, as a whole, produces at least $25.0 million in consolidated gross revenues each year. Nasdaq generated gross revenues of approximately $4.3 billion in 2019. The remaining rights under the Nasdaq Earn-out were transferred to Newmark on September 28, 2017. See Note 7 - Marketable Securities\u201d to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nManagement services, servicing fees and other revenue increased $203.2 million, or 54.1%, to $579.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. $86.2 million of the increase was related to additional pass-through revenues resulting from the implementation of ASC 606, while $59.5 million was related to the valuation and advisory business. Additionally, $21.3 million or 19.3% of the increase was related to servicing fee revenues, which includes interest income of $9.0 million on Loans held for sale.\nNewmark accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method as prescribed in U.S. GAAP guidance, Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to basis differences between our accompanying consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Certain of Newmark's entities are taxed as U.S. partnerships and are subject to UBT in New York City. Therefore, the tax liability or benefit related to the partnership income or loss except for UBT rests with the partners, rather than the partnership entity. As such, the partners' tax liability or benefit is not reflected in our accompanying consolidated financial statements. The tax-related assets, liabilities, provisions or benefits included in our accompanying consolidated financial statements also reflect the results of the entities that are taxed as corporations, either in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions.\nCompensation and Employee Benefits\nFees to related parties that are charged by BGC Partners and/or Cantor to Newmark are reflected as cash flows from operating activities in our accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows for each period presented. All other amounts sent to or from BGC Partners and Cantor are reflected as cash flows from financing activities in our accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows for each period presented.\nOperating, administrative and other expenses increased $30.1 million, or 9.1%, to $361.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily driven by increases in selling and promotional and other expenses associated with acquisitions and new hires, an increase in interest expense on the warehouse facilities collateralized by GSEs of $3.8 million, which is partially offset by the increase in interest income on Loans held for sale, at fair value.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was $986.8 million. However, excluding activity from loan originations and sales, net cash provided by operating activities was $211.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. We expect to generate cash flows from operations to fund our business operations and growth strategy to meet our short-term liquidity requirements, which we define as the next 12 months. We also expect that cash flows from operations, cash on hand, and our $250.0 million Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our operations, growth strategy and dividends and distributions to meet our long-term liquidity requirements.\nAs part of our compensation plans, certain employees have been granted limited partnership units in Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings, which generally receive quarterly allocations of net income and are generally contingent upon services being provided by the unit holders. Certain Newmark employees also hold non-distribution earnings units (e.g. NPSUs and NREUs, collectively N Units\u201d) that do not participate in quarterly partnership distributions and are not allocated any items of profit or loss. These N Units vest into distribution earnings units over a 4-year period. As prescribed in U.S. GAAP guidance, the quarterly allocations of net income on such limited partnership units are reflected as a component of compensation expense under Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations. During 2019, Newmark simplified its compensation structure when hiring new personnel by issuing restricted stock units in lieu of limited partnership units. Newmark continues to monitor its compensation policy and make changes where necessary to attract industry leading producers to Newmark.\nCapital markets revenue increased by $71.2 million, or 17.9%, to $468.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was driven by strong improvement in volumes for the investment sales and mortgage brokerage business.\n \u2022 the assumption and repayment of indebtedness by the BGC Group and the Newmark Group, as further described below; \n \u2022 Leasing and Other Commissions. We offer a diverse range of commercial real estate brokerage and advisory services, including tenant and agency representation, which includes comprehensive lease negotiations, strategic planning, site selection, lease auditing, and other financial and market analysis. \nCash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2018\n (3) Long-term debt reflects long-term borrowings of $550.0 million 6.125% Senior Notes. The carrying amount of these notes was approximately $540.4 million. Long-term debt also includes the borrowings under the Credit Facility, which is assumed to be outstanding until the maturity date of the Credit Facility. The carrying amount of the borrowings under the Credit Facility is $48.9 million. (See Note 22 - Long-Term Debt\u201d to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.) \nWe have loan commitments to extend credit to third parties. The commitments to extend credit are for mortgage loans at a specific rate (rate lock commitments). These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require a fee. We are committed to extend credit to the counterparty as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the commitment contracts.\nOperating, administrative and other expenses increased $112.6 million, or 51.4%, to $331.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily driven by $86.2 million directly related to additional pass-through expenses resulting from the implementation of ASC 606. Additionally, interest expense on the warehouse facilities collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises increased $7.3 million, which is commensurate with the increase in interest income on Loans held for sale.\n\nPrior to and in connection with the Spin-Off, 14.8 million Newmark Units held by BGC were exchanged into 9.4 million shares of Newmark Class A common stock and 5.4 million shares of Newmark Class B common stock, and 7.0 million Newmark OpCo Units held by BGC were exchanged into 6.9 million shares of Newmark Class A common stock. These Newmark Class A and Class B shares of common stock were included in the Spin-Off to BGC's stockholders.\nA valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if it is deemed more likely than not that those assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, Newmark considers all available evidence, including past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies.\nResults of Operations\nThe preparation of our accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP guidance requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our accompanying consolidated financial statements. These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, our accompanying consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows could be materially affected. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.\nExpenses\nThe first step of the process involves comparing each reporting unit's estimated fair value with its carrying value, including goodwill. To estimate the fair value of the reporting units, we use a discounted cash flow model and data regarding market comparables. The valuation process requires significant judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These assumptions include cash flow projections, estimated cost of capital and the selection of peer companies and relevant multiples. Because significant assumptions and estimates are used in projecting future cash flows, choosing peer companies and selecting relevant multiples, actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is deemed not to be impaired. If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of potential impairment.\nIn some instances, Newmark performs services for customers and incurs out-of-pocket expenses as part of delivering those services. Newmark's customers agree to reimburse Newmark for those expenses, and those reimbursements are part of the contract's transaction price. Consequently, these expenses and the reimbursements of such expenses from the customer are presented on a gross basis because the services giving rise to the out-of-pocket expenses do not transfer a good or service. The reimbursements are included in the transaction price when the costs are incurred, and the reimbursements are due from the customer.\nOn March 28, 2019, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 pursuant to which CF&Co may make offers and sales of our 6.125% Senior Notes in connection with ongoing market-making transactions which may occur from time to time. Such market-making transactions in these securities may occur in the open market or may be privately negotiated at prevailing market prices at a time of resale or at related or negotiated prices. Neither CF&Co, nor any of our affiliates, has any obligation to make a market in our securities, and CF&Co or any such other affiliate may discontinue market-making activities at any time without notice. Newmark does not receive any proceeds from market-making activities in these securities by CF&Co (or any of its affiliates).\nadjustment). As of December 31, 2019, the exchange ratio was 0.9400 shares of Newmark common stock per Newmark Holdings unit.\nInterest expense, net decreased by $18.1 million to $32.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Interest expense decreased due to the reduction in our long-term debt.\nThe fair value of RSU awards to employees is determined on the date of grant, based on the fair value of our Class A common stock. Generally, RSUs granted by us as employee compensation do not receive dividend equivalents; as such, we adjust the fair value of the RSUs for the present value of expected forgone dividends, which requires us to include an estimate of expected dividends as a valuation input. This grant-date fair value is amortized to expense ratably over the awards' vesting periods. For RSUs with graded vesting features, we have made an accounting policy election to recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis. The amortization is reflected as non-cash equity-based compensation expense in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nEQUITY\n \u2022 Technology, professional and business services and healthcare continued to power demand for office space; \nEquity-Based and Other Compensation\nHiring and Acquisitions\nMarket Statistics\nSeparation, Initial Public Offering, and Spin-Off\nNewmark completed acquisitions for which contingent cash consideration of $29.3 million and limited partnership units of 0.4 million may be issued on certain targets being met through 2022. The contingent equity instruments are included in the Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities\u201d on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The contingent cash liability is recorded at fair value as deferred consideration on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nNewmark's Compensation Committee may grant various equity-based awards to employees of Newmark, including restricted stock units, limited partnership units and exchange rights for shares of Newmark's Class A common stock upon exchange of Newmark limited partnership units (See Note 2 - Limited Partnership Interests in Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings\u201d, to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). On December 13, 2017, as part of the Separation, the Newmark Group, Inc. Long Term Incentive Plan (the Newmark Equity Plan\u201d) was approved by Newmark's sole stockholder at the time, BGC, for Newmark to issue up to 400.0 million aggregate number of shares of Class A common stock of Newmark, of which 65.0 million are pursuant to effective registration statements on Form S-8 that may be delivered or cash-settled pursuant to awards granted during the life of the Newmark Equity Plan. As of December 31, 2019, awards with respect to 20.8 million shares have been granted and 379.2 million shares are available for future awards.\naverage determination price of $10.61 per unit). Additionally, on December 19, 2019, Mr. Merkel exchanged 4,222 already exchangeable Newmark Holdings PSUs held by him in exchange for Class A common stock. The above transaction resulted in income of $3,791,848 for Mr. Merkel, of which the Company withheld $1,989,483 for taxes and issued the remaining $1,802,365 in the form of 132,429 net shares of Class A common stock at a price of $13.61 per share.\nIncome Taxes\nCash Flows\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was $85.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was attributable to the change in Newmark's corporate structure related to the Separation.\nFinancial Highlights\nFollowing the Spin-Off and the BGC Holdings distribution, BGC Partners ceased to be our controlling stockholder, and BGC and its subsidiaries no longer held any shares of our common stock or other equity interests in us or our subsidiaries. Therefore, BGC no longer consolidates Newmark with its financial results subsequent to the Spin-Off. Cantor continues to control Newmark and its subsidiaries following the Spin-Off and the BGC Holdings distribution.\nThe following key trends drove the commercial real estate market during 2019:\nIn December 2019, we completed the acquisition of Harper Dennis Hobbs Holdings Limited, a tenant-focused real estate advisory services firm, based in London.\nGoodwill\nadvances to be repaid in full from the future distributions on existing and future awards granted. The allocations of net income to the awards are treated as compensation expense and the proceeds from distributions are used to repay the loan. The forgivable portion of any loans is recognized as compensation expense in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations over the life of the loan. We review the loan balances each reporting period for collectability. If we determine that the collectability of a portion of the loan balances is not expected, we recognize a reserve against the loan balances. Actual collectability of loan balances may differ from our estimates. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the aggregate balance of employee loans, net of reserve, was $403.7 million and $285.5 million, respectively, and is included as Loans, forgivable loans and other receivables from employees and partners, net\u201d in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Compensation expense for the above-mentioned employee loans for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 were $39.0 million, $27.7 million, and $34.4 million, respectively. The compensation expense related to these loans was included as part of Compensation and employee benefits\u201d in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nOur fully diluted weighted-average share count for the year ended December 31, 2019 was as follows (in thousands):\n\nInterest expense of $50.2 million incurred during the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily related to $58.4 million of interest expense on Newmark's debt, which included a $7.0 million prepayment fee on long- term debt repaid as part of the Spin-Off. This was partially offset by $4.7 million of interest income primarily related to interest income on employee loans and $3.8 million of interest earned on bank deposits.\nCapital markets revenue increased by $72.4 million, or 15.4%, to $541.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was driven by a 47.6% increase in mortgage brokerage\n\nEquity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs increased by $34.2 million, or 15.2%, to $258.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily driven by an increase of $32.9 million in equity amortization.\n (2) Reclassifications have been made to previously reported amounts to conform to the new presentation.  Year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018\nSee Note 1 - Organization and Basis of Presentation\u201d, to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements.\n\nBecause Newmark recognizes OMSR gains equal to the fair value of servicing rights retained on mortgage loans originated and sold, it also amortizes MSRs in proportion to the net servicing revenue expected to be earned. Subsequent to the initial recording, MSRs are amortized and carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our expenses included $101.5 million and $78.4 million of MSR amortization, respectively. $17.1 million of the increase in MSR amortization was due to an impairment of the MSR to fair value resulting from a year over year decline in interest rates.\nContemporaneously with the issuance of the EPUs, the special purpose vehicle (the SPV\u201d) that is a consolidated subsidiary of Newmark entered into four variable postpaid forward contracts with RBC (together, the Nasdaq Forwards\u201d). The SPV is an indirect subsidiary of Newmark whose sole assets are the Nasdaq Earn-outs for 2019 through 2022. The Nasdaq Forwards provide the SPV the option to settle using up to 992,247 shares of Nasdaq common stock, to be received by the SPV pursuant to the Nasdaq Earn-out (See Note 7 - Marketable Securities\u201d to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), or Newmark Class A common stock, in exchange for either cash or redemption of the EPUs, notice of which must be provided to RBC prior to November 1 of each year from 2019 through 2022.\n \u2022 Management Services, Servicing Fees and Other. We provide commercial services to tenants and landlords. In this business, we provide property and facilities management services along with project management, valuation and appraisal services and other consulting services, as well as technology, to customers who may also utilize our commercial real estate brokerage services. Servicing fees are derived from the servicing of loans originated by us as well as loans originated by third parties. \nThe adoption of the new guidance did not have a significant impact on our accompanying consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statements of changes in equity, and consolidated statements of cash flows.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCredit Ratings\nAccording to a preliminary report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employers added a monthly average of approximately 175 thousand net new payroll jobs during 2019, which was below the seasonally adjusted average of 193 thousand per month in 2018.\nNasdaq Monetization Transactions\nCapital Markets\nSteady economic growth and historically low interest rates have helped push vacancy rates down for the office, apartment, and industrial markets over the current economic expansion, which began in July 2009. Construction activity, while increasing, remains low compared with prior expansion cycles and low relative to demand and absorption, which means that property leasing markets continue to tighten. Overall, demand for commercial real estate remains strong. U.S. office asking rates increased by 1.3% year-over-year, according to Newmark Research.\nover the period of, the projected net servicing income. For purposes of impairment evaluation and measurement, Newmark stratifies MSRs based on predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans, primarily by investor type (Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac, FHA/GNMA, CMBS and other). To the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of a specific MSR strata, a valuation allowance is established, which is adjusted in the future as the fair value of MSRs increases or decreases. Reversals of valuation allowances cannot exceed the previously recognized impairment up to the amortized cost.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, Newmark's total revenues were $2.2 billion, an 8.3% increase, as compared to 2018. For the full year 2019, all major business lines were up as compared with 2018. More than 85% of our overall revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2019 was organic. Newmark continued to gain market share in 2019, as evidenced by its volume growth of 20% in investment sales, 48% in mortgage brokerage, and 16% in GSE originations. Total investment sales and debt increased by $16.0 billion, or 25.0% to $81.0 billion in 2019 as compared to 2018.\nIn the aggregate, BGC distributed 131,886,409 shares of our Class A common stock and 21,285,537 shares of our Class B common stock to BGC's stockholders in the Spin-Off. These shares of our common stock collectively represented approximately 94% of the total voting power of our outstanding common stock and approximately 87% of the total economics of our outstanding common stock in each case as of the Distribution Date.\n \u2022 the proportional distribution in the Separation of interests in Newmark Holdings to holders of interests in BGC Holdings; ", "item_7_text": "On December 31, 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the cancellation of 13,552 non-exchangeable PSUs in BGC Holdings held by Mr. Rispoli and the cancellation of 11,089 BGC Holdings PPSUs (which had an average determination price of $5.814 per unit). In connection with the transaction, BGC issued $134,535 in shares of Class A common stock, less applicable taxes and withholdings, resulting in 13,552 net shares of BGC Class A common stock at a price of $5.17 per share and the payment of $64,471 for taxes. On February 22, 2019, the Compensation Committee removed the sale restrictions on 4,229 shares of BGC Class A common stock and 1,961 shares of Newmark Class A common stock held by Mr. Rispoli.\nInitial Public Offering\nCredit ratings and associated outlooks are influenced by several factors, including but not limited to: operating environment, earnings and profitability trends, the prudence of funding and liquidity management practices, balance sheet size/composition and resulting leverage, cash flow coverage of interest, composition and size of the capital base, available liquidity, outstanding borrowing levels and the firm's competitive position in the industry. A credit rating and/or the associated outlook can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change. Any reduction in our credit ratings and/or the associated outlook could adversely affect the availability of debt financing on terms acceptable to us, as well as the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain any such financing. In addition, credit ratings and associated outlooks may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions. In connection with certain agreements, interest rates on our notes may incur increases of up to 2% in the event of a credit ratings downgrade.\nThe following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly results of operations for the indicated periods (in thousands). Results of any period are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year and may, in certain periods, be affected by seasonal fluctuations in our business. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the current period's presentation.\nThe EPUs were issued in four tranches and are separately convertible by either RBC or Newmark into a fixed number of shares of Newmark Class A common stock, subject to a revenue hurdle in each of the fourth quarters of 2019 through 2022 for each of the respective four tranches. The ability to convert the EPUs into Newmark Class A common stock is subject to the SPV's option to settle the postpaid forward contracts as described below. As the EPUs represent equity ownership of a consolidated subsidiary of Newmark, they have been included in Noncontrolling interests\u201d on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of changes in equity. The EPUs are entitled to a preferred payable-in-kind dividend, which is recorded as accretion to the carrying amount of the EPUs through Retained earnings\u201d on our accompanying consolidated statements of changes in equity and are reductions to Net income (loss) available to common stockholders\u201d for the purpose of calculating earnings per share.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of sales growth, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities, our expansion into other markets and our results of operations. To the extent that existing cash, cash from operations and credit facilities, and Nasdaq shares are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public equity or debt financing. As of December 31, 2019, our long-term debt consists of our 6.125% Senior Notes with a carrying amount of $540.4 million and $50.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facility.\nOverview and Business Environment\nOn August 1, 2018, the Newmark Board of Directors and Audit Committee authorized repurchases of shares of Newmark's Class A common stock and purchases of limited partnership interests or other equity interests in Newmark's subsidiaries up to $200 million, increased from the $100 million that had been authorized on March 12, 2018. This authorization includes repurchases of stock or units from executive officers, other employees and partners, including of BGC and Cantor, as well as other affiliated persons or entities. From time to time, Newmark may actively continue to repurchase shares and/or purchase units. As of December 31, 2019, Newmark has repurchased 4.6 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $9.32. As of December 31, 2019, Newmark had $157.4 million remaining from its share repurchase and unit purchase authorization.\nFees to related parties increased by $5.4 million, or 26.0%, to $26.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Fees to related parties are allocations paid to BGC Partners and Cantor for administrative and support services.\nAs of January 1, 2018, Newmark had an outstanding balance of $112.5 million under the 2042 Promissory Note payable to BGC. On September 4, 2018, Newmark borrowed $112.5 million under the Intercompany Credit Agreement and repaid this note in full.\nRevenue Recognition\nOn November 2, 2018, Newmark announced the pricing of an offering of $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Senior Notes due 2023, which closed on November 6, 2018. The 6.125% Senior Notes were offered and sold in a private offering exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act. The 6.125% Senior Notes are general senior unsecured obligations of Newmark. These 6.125% Senior Notes were priced at 98.937% to yield 6.375%. The 6.125% Senior Notes bear an interest rate of 6.125% per annum, payable on each May 15 and November 15, beginning on May 15, 2019 and will mature on November 15, 2023. The 6.125% Senior Notes were subsequently exchanged for notes with substantially similar terms that were registered under the Securities Act.\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\nSee Regulation\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our regulatory environment.\nProvision for income taxes decreased by $38.1 million, or 42.1%, to $52.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily driven by the mix of allocable revenues among legal entities as a corporation versus flow through and certain return to provision adjustments, in addition to the revaluation of the deferred tax assets in the prior year, due to the Spin-Off. In general, our consolidated effective tax rate can vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of our earnings.\nstructured transactions. Newmark also has corresponding commitments to sell these loans to various purchasers as they are funded.\nCompensation and employee benefits expense increased by $174.3 million, or 17.6%, to $1,162.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The main drivers of this increase were $122.4 million of additional payments directly related to the increase in revenues.\nindustry are based on when loans are sold and/or securitized, and typically lag those reported by Newmark and its competitors by 30 to 45 days.\n\nOverview\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by $40.8 million, or 47.9%, to $44.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to the change in Newmark's corporate structure related to the Separation.\nEconomic Growth in the United States\nWe have an effective registration statement on Form S-4, with respect to the offer and sale of up to 20.0 million shares of our Class A common stock from time to time in connection with business combination transactions, including acquisitions of other businesses, assets, properties or securities. As of December 31, 2019, we have issued 0.4 million shares of our Class A common stock under this registration statement.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our public long-term credit ratings and associated outlooks are as follows:\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nAccording to NKF Research, the average vacancy rate for office improved 20 basis points year-over-year to 12.9%, industrial increased slightly to 5.2%, while retail rose 40 basis points compared with the year earlier. Against this backdrop, revenues from our leasing and other commissions business increased by 4.6% year-over-year in 2019.\nExpenses\nIn February 2019, the Audit Committee of the Company authorized Newmark and its subsidiaries to originate and service GSE loans to Cantor and its affiliates (other than BGC) and service loans originated by Cantor and its affiliates (other than BGC) on prices, rates and terms no less favorable to Newmark and its subsidiaries than those charged by third parties. The authorization is subject to certain terms and conditions, including but not limited to: (i) a maximum amount up to $100.0 million per loan, (ii) a $250.0 million limit on loans that have not yet been acquired or sold to a GSE at any given time, and (iii) a separate $250.0 million limit on originated Fannie Mae loans outstanding to Cantor at any given time.\nEquity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\nInterest (Expense) Income, Net\nThe measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of enacted tax laws and involves uncertainties in the application of tax regulations in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions. Because Newmark's interpretation of complex tax law may impact the measurement of current and deferred income taxes, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions regarding the application of tax law.\nMSRs are assessed for impairment, at least on an annual basis, based upon the fair value of those rights as compared to the amortized cost. Fair values are estimated using a valuation model that calculates the present value of the future net servicing cash flows. In using this valuation method, Newmark incorporates assumptions that management believes market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income. The fair value estimates are sensitive to significant assumptions used in the valuation model such as prepayment rates, cost of servicing, escrow earnings rates, discount rates and servicing multiples, which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions derived, in part, from historical data. It is reasonably possible that such estimates may change. Newmark amortizes the MSRs in proportion to, and\nBalance Sheet\n (2) Includes payments for new hires and producers in the amount of $161.9 million, $109.6 million, and $34.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nNewmark's loan origination volumes are driven more by the GSE multifamily financing volumes than the activity level of the overall commercial mortgage market. Overall industry GSE multifamily origination volumes increased by approximately 4% year-over-year in 2019. In comparison, Newmark's combined notional volumes across GSE and FHA multifamily loan originations increased by 16.1% year-over-year. The GSE multifamily agency volume statistics for the\nOther income, net of $81.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily related to the recognition of income from the receipt of Nasdaq shares of $113.9 million, including appreciation of Nasdaq shares held by Newmark, and unrealized gains of $12.2 million relating to non-marketable investments carried under the measurement alternative, partially offset by mark-to-market losses related to the Nasdaq Forwards of $51.1 million.\nSee Note 13 - Revenues from Contracts with Customers\u201d to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for further information.\nCompensation and Employee Benefits\ncapital account and $0.5 million of limited partnership units in exchange for the cash payment from Cantor to Newmark of $2.2 million. In consideration for the Cantor payment, Newmark has agreed to return up to a maximum of $3.3 million to Cantor based on the employees' production during their first two years of employment with Newmark. As of December 31, 2019, Newmark has $2.6 million included in Payables to related parties\u201d on the consolidated balance sheets, to be returned to Cantor related to this transaction. Newmark has agreed to allow certain of these employees to continue to provide consulting services to Cantor in exchange for a forgivable loan which was directly paid by Cantor to these employees.\nRevenues\nOn July 22, 2019, Cantor Commercial Real Estate Lending, L.P. ( CCRE Lending\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Real Estate LP, made a $146.6 million commercial real estate loan (the Loan\u201d) to a single-purpose company (the Borrower\u201d) in which Barry Gosin, Newmark's Chief Executive Officer, owns a 19% interest. The Loan is secured by the Borrower's interest in property in Pennsylvania that is subject to a ground lease. While CCRE Lending initially provided the full loan amount, on August 16, 2019, a third-party bank purchased approximately 80% of the Loan value from CCRE Lending, with CCRE Lending retaining approximately 20%. The Loan matures on August 6, 2029, and is payable monthly at a fixed interest rate of 4.38% per annum. Newmark provided certain commercial loan brokerage services to the Borrower in the ordinary course of its business, and the Borrower paid Newmark a fee, as the broker of the Loan, of $0.7 million. The Newmark Audit Committee approved the commercial loan brokerage services and the related fee amount received.\nLong-term debt\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we used $332.4 million of cash from operations. However, excluding activity from loan originations and sales, net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $295.9 million. We had consolidated net income of $191.9 million, $149.9 million of positive adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash used by operating activities (excluding activity from loan originations and sales) and $45.9 million of negative changes in operating assets and liabilities. The negative change in operating assets and liabilities included $109.6 million of increases in loans, forgivable loans and other receivables from employees and partners primarily related to continued hiring and expansion of our business and $129.5 million of increase in receivables related to acquisitions and increased revenues, offset by an increase of $203.1 million in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities. Cash provided by investing activities was $7.7 million, primarily related to $95.9 million of proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, partially offset by $34.5 million of payments for acquisitions, $29.5 million in non-marketable investments and $21.0 million of purchases of fixed assets. We generated $338.6 million of cash from financing activities primarily due to net proceeds from warehouse facilities collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises of $611.9 million, $242.0 million of proceeds from BGC's 2018\nEquity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs increased by $77.5 million, or 52.7%, to $224.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily driven by an increase of $79.9 million in exchangeability and common stock charges and an increase in allocations of income of $26.2 million as a result of an increase in pre-tax earnings.\nBGC's Investment in Newmark Holdings\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n \u2022 Apartment rents benefited from sustained job growth and underlying demographic trends towards apartment living among two key age groups: millennials and baby boomers; and \nAs of December 31, 2019, Newmark had $1.1 billion of committed loan funding available through three commercial banks, an uncommitted warehouse line of $300.0 million, and an uncommitted $400.0 million Fannie Mae loan repurchase facility. Consistent with industry practice, these warehouse facilities are short-term, requiring annual renewal. These warehouse facilities are collateralized by an assignment of the underlying mortgage loans originated under its various lending programs and third-party purchase commitments and are recourse only to our wholly-owned subsidiary, Berkeley Point Capital, LLC. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $209.6 million and $972.4 million outstanding under Warehouse facilities collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises\u201d on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\n \u2022 the principal corporate transactions pursuant to which BGC, BGC Holdings and BGC U.S. OpCo and their respective subsidiaries (other than the Newmark Group (defined below), the BGC Group\u201d) transferred to Newmark, Newmark Holdings and Newmark OpCo and their respective subsidiaries (the Newmark Group\u201d) the assets and liabilities of the BGC Group relating to BGC's Real Estate Services business, including BGC's interests in both BPF and Real Estate LP (together with the proportional distribution and assumption and repayment of indebtedness described in the following bullets, the ( Separation\u201d); \nConcurrently with the acquisition of Berkeley Point Acquisition, on September 8, 2017 Newmark invested $100.0 million in a newly formed commercial real estate-related financial and investment business, CF Real Estate Finance Holdings, L.P. ( Real Estate LP\u201d), which is controlled and managed by Cantor (as defined below). Real Estate LP may conduct activities in any real estate related business or asset backed securities-related business or any extensions thereof and ancillary activities thereto. In addition, Real Estate LP may provide short-term loans to related parties from time to time when funds in excess of amounts needed for investment are available. Newmark's investment in Real Estate LP is accounted for under the equity method.\nCantor Credit Agreement\n (1) Common stock consisted of Class A shares, Class B shares and contingent shares for which all necessary conditions have been satisfied except for the passage of time. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the weighted-average number of Class A shares was 156.2 million shares, Class B shares was 21.3 million shares and approximately 0.2 million shares of contingent Class A common stock and limited partnership units were included in our fully diluted EPS computation because the conditions for issuance had been met by the end of the period. \nShare Exchange Agreement\nLiquidity\nEmployee Loans: We have entered into various agreements with certain of our employees and partners whereby these individuals receive loans that may be either wholly or in part repaid from distributions that the individuals receive on some or all of their limited partnership interests or may be forgiven over a period of time. Cash advance distribution loans are documented in formal agreements and are repayable in timeframes outlined in the underlying agreements. We intend for these\nOther Income, Net\nIn connection with the Company's 2019 executive compensation process, the Company's executive officers received certain monetization of prior awards as compensation at Newmark, as set forth below.\nOther income of $127.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily related to the recognition of income from the receipt of Nasdaq shares of $87.2 million, as well as the mark-to-market adjustment related to the variable share forward of $19.0 million, and recognized gain of $17.9 million relating to investments carried under the measurement alternative of ASU 2016-01. Other income of $73.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily related to the recognition of income from the receipt of Nasdaq shares of $76.3 million.\nRepurchase Program\nUnit Redemptions and Exchanges - Executive Officers\nOperating, Administrative and Other\nGains from Mortgage Banking Activities/Originations, Net\nSee Note 3 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 18 - Leases\u201d to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for further information.\nOn November 30, 2018 Newmark entered into an unsecured credit agreement with Cantor. The Cantor Credit Agreement provides for each party to issue loans to the other party in the lender's discretion. Pursuant to the Cantor Credit Agreement, the parties and their respective subsidiaries (with respect to CFLP, other than BGC and its subsidiaries) may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $250.0 million from each other from time to time at an interest rate which is the higher of CFLP's or Newmark's short-term borrowing rate then in effect, plus 1.0%. As of December 31, 2019, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Cantor Credit Agreement.\nWe also use third-party service providers in the provision of its services to customers. In instances where a third-party service provider is used, Newmark performs an analysis to determine whether Newmark is acting as a principal or an agent with respect to the services provided. To the extent that Newmark determines that it is acting as a principal, the revenue and the expenses incurred are recorded on a gross basis. In instances where Newmark has determined that it is acting as an agent, the revenue and expenses are presented on a net basis within the revenue line item.\nGoodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. As prescribed in U.S. GAAP guidance, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is not amortized, but instead is periodically tested for impairment. We review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever an event occurs, or circumstances change that could reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.\nRevenues\nThe adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019 resulted in the recognition of Right-of-use ( ROU\u201d) assets of approximately $178.8 million and ROU liabilities of approximately $226.7 million, with no effect on beginning retained earnings.\nKey drivers of our revenue are producer headcount and average revenue per producer. We believe that our strong technology platform and equity and partnership structure have enabled us to use both acquisitions and recruiting to profitably increase our front-office revenue and revenue per producer, over time.\nOver the past several years, we expanded our capital markets capabilities through the strategic addition of many prolific, accomplished capital markets producers in key markets throughout the United States. We have access to many of the world's largest owners of commercial real estate, and this will drive growth throughout the life cycle of each real estate asset by allowing us to provide best-in-class agency leasing and property management during the ownership period. We also provide investment sales and arrange debt and equity financing to assist owners in maximizing the return on investment in each of their real estate assets. Specifically, with respect to multifamily assets, we are a leading GSE lender by loan origination volume and servicer with a servicing portfolio of $62.3 billion as of December 31, 2019 (of which 3.9% relates to special servicing). This servicing portfolio provides a steady stream of income over the life of the serviced loans. Additionally, we expect to see continued growth from our valuation and advisory and property management businesses, particularly in conjunction with our increasingly robust capital markets platform. In 2019, we did $81.3 billion of investment sales and debt transaction volume which was up $16.3 billion, or 25.1% over 2018.\nCertain of Newmark's agreements with Fannie Mae allow Newmark to originate and service loans under Fannie Mae's Delegated Underwriting and Servicing ( DUS\u201d) Program. These agreements require Newmark to maintain sufficient collateral to meet Fannie Mae's restricted and operational liquidity requirements based on a pre-established formula. Certain of Newmark's agreements with Freddie Mac allow Newmark to service loans under Freddie Mac's Targeted Affordable Housing ( TAH\u201d) Program. These agreements require Newmark to pledge sufficient collateral to meet Freddie Mac's liquidity requirement of 8% of the outstanding principal of TAH loans serviced by Newmark. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, Newmark has met all liquidity requirements.\nOn October 30, 2019, the Audit and Compensation Committees of the Board of Directors authorized and the Company executed the repurchase from Mr. Merkel of 55,193 shares of Newmark Class A common stock at $10.69 per share, the closing price on October 30, 2019.\nLeasing and other commission revenues increased by $37.3 million, or 4.6%, to $854.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was largely due to organic growth.\nOn December 31, 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the monetization of 1,909,188 BGC Holdings PSUs held by Mr. Gosin and 264,985 BGC Holdings PPSUs (which had an average determination price of $4.2625 per unit), which transactions had an aggregate value of $11,000,000. On February 6, 2019, the Compensation Committee approved a modification which consisted of the following: (i) the right to exchange 1,592,016 non-exchangeable HDUs (which, based on the closing price of the BGC Class A common stock of $6.20 per share on such date, had a value of $9,870,501); and (ii) the right to exchange for cash 264,985 BGC Holdings non-exchangeable PPSUs held by Mr. Gosin, (which had an average determination price of $4.2625 per unit), for a payment of $1,129,499 for taxes when (i) is exchanged. On February 22, 2019, the Compensation Committee initially approved for Mr. Gosin grants in Newmark Holdings NPSUs and NPPSUs. On April 25, 2019, the Compensation Committee modified Mr. Gosin's awards by canceling the grant of the previously mentioned Newmark Holdings NPSUs and NPPSUs and by granting non-exchangeable Newmark Holdings PSUs and PPSUs. The Committee approved this modification in order to reflect an annual compensation structure rather than a long-term NPSU/NPPSU structure.\nGrowth Drivers\nOur origination business is impacted by the lending caps imposed by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (the FHFA\u201d). On September 13, 2019, the FHFA revised its industry-wide multifamily loan purchase caps to $200.0 billion combined for the five-quarter period from the fourth quarter of 2019 to the fourth quarter of 2020. These caps on an annualized basis exceed total 2019 GSE volume of $148.5 billion and provide visibility through the end of 2020. Of the $200.0 billion, 37.5% must be loans in the affordable and underserved market segments, as well as loans that finance water and energy efficiency improvements.\n (3) For the year ended December 31, 2019, the weighted-average share count includes 84.5 million potentially anti-dilutive securities, which were excluded in the computation of fully diluted earnings per share.  Our fully diluted period-end (spot) share count for the year ended December 31, 2019 was as follows (in thousands):\nRegulatory Environment\nSee Business-Regulation\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information related to our regulatory environment.\nRestricted Stock Units: We account for equity-based compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of U.S. GAAP guidance. Restricted stock units (which we refer to as RSUs\u201d) provided to certain employees are accounted for as equity awards, and in accordance with U.S. GAAP guidance, we are required to record an expense for the portion of the RSUs that is ultimately expected to vest. Further, U.S. GAAP guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Because significant assumptions are used in estimating employee turnover and associated forfeiture rates, actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nManagement services, servicing fees and other revenue increased $45.0 million, or 7.8%, to $624.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Valuation and advisory increased $21.4 million, or 31.1%. Servicing fees increased $11.1 million (which includes a $4.1 million increase in interest income on escrow balances and a $3.5 million increase in yield maintenance fees), and interest income on loans held for sale increased $2.0 million, which was largely offset by additional interest expense on the warehouse facilities collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises.\n \u2022 the IPO; \nOther Income, Net\nFrom time to time, we may also enter into agreements with employees and partners to grant bonus and salary advances or other types of loans. These advances and loans are repayable in the timeframes outlined in the underlying agreements. In addition, we also enter into deferred compensation agreements with employees providing services to us. The costs associated with such plans are generally amortized over the period in which they vest. (See Note 30 - Compensation\u201d and Note 31 - Commitment and Contingencies\u201d, to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nGains from Mortgage Banking Activities/Originations, Net\nCertain of these limited partnership units entitle the holders to receive post-termination payments equal to the notional amount in four equal yearly installments after the holder's termination. These limited partnership units are accounted for as post-termination liability awards under U.S. GAAP guidance, which requires that Newmark record an expense for such awards based on the change in value at each reporting period and include the expense in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations as part of Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs.\u201d The liability for limited partnership units with a post-termination payout is included in Other long-term liabilities\u201d on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nThe second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated a potential impairment may exist. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one, over the estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identified intangibles. Events such as economic weakness, significant declines in operating results of reporting units, or significant changes to critical inputs of the goodwill impairment test (e.g., estimates of cash flows or cost of capital) could cause the estimated fair value of our reporting units to decline, which could result in an impairment of goodwill in the future.\nEquity Method Investments\nLiquidity\nOn December 15, 2017, Newmark announced the pricing of the IPO of 20 million shares of Newmark Class A common stock at a price to the public of $14.00 per share, which was completed on December 19, 2017. Newmark Class A shares began trading on December 15, 2017 on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol NMRK\u201d. In addition, Newmark granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 3 million shares of Newmark Class A common stock at the IPO price, less underwriting discounts and commissions. On December 26, 2017, the underwriters of the IPO exercised in full their overallotment option to purchase an additional 3 million shares of Newmark Class A common stock from Newmark at the IPO price, less underwriting discounts and commission. As a result, Newmark received aggregate net proceeds of $295.4 million from the IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. See Note 27 - Related Party Transactions\u201d to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nManagement Services, Servicing Fees and Other\nEnterprises of $762.8 million, offset by an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities of $313.0 million, an increase in ROU liabilities of $227.9 million, and an increase in long-term debt of $51.4 million.\nOn November 28, 2018, Newmark entered into a credit agreement by and among Newmark, the several financial institutions from time to time party thereto, as Lenders, and Bank of America N.A., as administrative agent (the Credit Agreement\u201d). The Credit Agreement provides for a $250.0 million three-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility\u201d). As of December 31, 2019, there was $50.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facility.\nWe have various other operating expenses. We incur leasing, equipment and maintenance expenses. We also incur selling and promotion expenses, which include entertainment, marketing and travel-related expenses. We incur communication expenses, professional and consulting fees for legal, audit and other special projects, and interest expense related to short-term operational funding needs, and notes payable and collateralized borrowings.\nIn November 2018, the Audit Committee authorized Newmark to enter into an engagement agreement with CF&Co. and its affiliates to act as financial advisor in connection with one or more third-party business combination transactions as requested by Newmark on behalf of its affiliates from time to time on specified terms, conditions and fees.\nNewmark initially recognizes and measures the rights to service mortgage loans at fair value and subsequently measures them using the amortization method. Newmark recognizes rights to service mortgage loans as separate assets at the time the underlying originated mortgage loan is sold, and the value of those rights is included in the determination of the gains on loans held for sale. Purchased MSRs, including MSRs purchased from CCRE, are initially recorded at fair value, and subsequently measured using the amortization method.\nExpenses\nAs of January 1, 2018, Newmark had an outstanding balance of $400.0 million under a committed unsecured senior revolving credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A, as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders (the Converted Term Loan\u201d). On June 19, 2018, Newmark repaid $152.9 million, and on September 26, 2018 repaid $113.2 million of the Converted Term Loan, using the proceeds from the Newmark OpCo Preferred Investments (as defined below). On November 6, 2018, Newmark repaid the remaining balance of $133.9 million with the proceeds of the 6.125% Senior Notes.\nOur growth to date has been focused in North America. As of December 31, 2019, we have more than 5,600 employees, including more than 1,800 revenue-generating producers in over 137 offices in more than 105 cities. In addition, Newmark has licensed its name to 11 commercial real estate providers that operate out of 17 offices in certain locations where Newmark does not have its own offices.\nSee Note 27 - Related Party Transactions\u201d and Note 22 - Long-Term Debt\u201d to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nGains from mortgage banking activities, net decreased by $23.7 million, or 11.5%, to $182.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by lower OMSR revenue of $17.8 million. As with other multifamily agency lenders, the Company's mix of originations, and therefore revenues, can vary depending on the size of loans, as well by the categories of loans with respect to the FHA, Freddie Mac, and different Fannie Mae structures.\nOn December 13, 2017, prior to the closing of Newmark's initial public offering ( IPO\u201d), BGC, BGC Holdings, L.P. ( BGC Holdings\u201d), BGC Partners, L.P. ( BGC U.S. OpCo\u201d), Newmark, Newmark Holdings, L.P. ( Newmark Holdings\u201d), Newmark Partners, L.P. ( Newmark OpCo\u201d), and, solely for the provisions listed therein, Cantor Fitzgerald L.P. ( CFLP\u201d or Cantor\u201d, including Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. ( CF&Co\u201d) and BGC Global Holdings, L.P. ( BGC Global OpCo\u201d) entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement (as amended on November 8, 2018 and amended and restated on November 23, 2018, the Separation and Distribution Agreement\u201d). The Separation and Distribution Agreement sets forth the agreements among BGC, Cantor, Newmark and their respective subsidiaries regarding, among other things:\nWhen reviewing goodwill for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, or if we choose to bypass the qualitative assessment, we perform a goodwill impairment analysis using a two-step process. Newmark had goodwill balances as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 of $557.9 million and $515.3 million, respectively.\n (4) Reflects interest on the $550.0 million 6.125% Senior Notes until their maturity date of November 15, 2023, in addition to the borrowings of $50.0 million assumed to be outstanding until the maturity date of the Credit Facility. Interest on the borrowings under the Credit Facility was projected using the 1-month LIBOR rate plus 200 basis points. \nCertain limited partnership units held by Newmark employees are granted exchangeability into Class A common stock or may be redeemed in connection with the grant of shares of Class A common stock. At the time exchangeability is granted, or the shares are issued, Newmark recognizes an expense based on the fair value of the award on that date, which is included in Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\n \u2022 E-commerce and supply-chain optimization has pushed industrial absorption to 39 consecutive quarters of positive net absorption, reflecting tenant and owner-user demand for warehouses and distribution centers; \nOn September 9, 2019, the U.S. Department of the Treasury issued a Housing Reform Plan (the Plan\u201d) in response to a March 27, 2019 Presidential Memorandum soliciting reforms in the housing financing system designed to minimize taxpayer exposure to future bailouts. The primary recommendations of the Plan are: (i) that existing government support for the secondary markets should be explicitly defined, tailored and paid for; (ii) that the GSEs' conservatorship should come to an end; (iii) the implementation of reforms necessary to ensure that the GSEs, and any successors, are appropriately capitalized to withstand a severe economic downturn and that shareholders and unsecured creditors, rather than U.S. taxpayers, bear the losses; (iv) that the GSEs should continue to support affordable housing at a reasonable economic return that may be less than the return earned on other activities; (v) that the FHFA and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development should clearly define the appropriate roles and overlap between the GSEs and the Federal Housing Administration so as to avoid duplication and (vi) that measures should be implemented to level the playing field\u201d between the GSEs and private sector competitors. Additionally, in September 2019, FHFA announced a cap of $200 billion as the maximum volume for combined Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac multifamily volume through the end of 2020, of which 37.5% must meet certain affordability requirements. The foregoing proposals may have the effect of impacting the volume of business that we may do with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Additionally, the potential increase in our proportion of affordable business and the potential implementation of a fee to be charged in connection with the government's offer of a guarantee may alter the economics of the business and, accordingly, may impact our financial results.\nWe derive revenues from the following general four sources:\nNewmark receives up to a 3-basis point servicing fee and/or up to a 1-basis point surveillance fee on certain Freddie Mac loans after the loan is securitized in a Freddie Mac pool ( Freddie Mac Strip\u201d). The Freddie Mac Strip is also recognized at fair value and subsequently measured using the amortization method, but is recognized as a MSR at the securitization date.\nThe following discussion of Newmark's financial condition and results of operations should be read together with Newmark's accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes, as well as the Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information\u201d relating to forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, (the Securities Act\u201d), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, (the Exchange Act\u201d), included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. When used herein, the terms Newmark Knight Frank,\u201d Newmark,\u201d the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d and our\u201d refer to Newmark and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nQUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn connection with the Company's 2018 executive compensation process, the Company's executive officers received certain monetization of prior awards as compensation at Newmark, as set forth below.\nOn December 19, 2019, the Compensation Committee approved the right to (i) convert 443,872 non-exchangeable Newmark Holdings PSUs held by Mr. Gosin into 443,872 HDUs (which, based on the closing price of the Class A common stock of $13.61 per share on such date, had a value of $5,637,548); and (ii) exchange for cash 539,080 Newmark Holdings non-exchangeable PPSUs held by Mr. Gosin (which had an average determination price of $9.95 per unit) for a payment of $5,362,452 for taxes when (i) is exchanged.\nDepreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $33.4 million, or 34.2%, to $131.1 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was due to a $23.1 million increase in mortgage servicing rights amortization and a $9.0 million increase in fixed asset depreciation, which was due to a $5.0 million asset impairment related to Newmark's restructuring plan.\n (2) Warehouse facilities are collateralized by $215.3 million of loans held for sale, at fair value (See Note 21- Warehouse Facilities Collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises\u201d to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) which loans were either under commitment to be purchased by Freddie Mac or had confirmed forward trade commitments for the issuance of and purchase of Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities. \n (2) Partnership units collectively include founding/working partner units, limited partnership units, and Cantor units, (see Note 2 - Limited Partnership Interests in Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings\u201d, to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.) In general, these partnership units are potentially exchangeable into shares of Newmark Class A common stock. In addition, partnership units held by Cantor are generally exchangeable into shares of Newmark Class A common stock and/or for up to 23.1 million shares of Newmark Class B common stock. These partnership units also generally receive quarterly allocations of net income, after the deduction of the Preferred Distribution, based on their weighted-average pro rata share of economic ownership of the operating subsidiaries. As a result, these partnership units are included in the fully diluted share count calculation shown above. \nProvision for income taxes increased by $33.0 million, or 57.4%, to $90.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily driven by the mix of allocable revenues among legal entities as a corporation versus flow through and certain return to provision adjustments, partially offset by changes in the valuation allowance. In general, our consolidated effective tax rate can vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of our earnings.\nBerkeley Point Acquisition and Investment in Real Estate LP\nContingent Payments Related to Acquisitions\nImpact of Adopting Lease Guidance\n\nRegulatory Requirements\nIn April 2019, we acquired MLG Commercial, a leading commercial real estate company offering both brokerage and property management services in Wisconsin.\nWarehouse Facilities Collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises\nAs of January 1, 2018, Newmark had an outstanding balance of $40.0 million under an unsecured senior credit agreement, which was amended and restated on March 19, 2018 ( Intercompany Credit Agreement\u201d). Through the year ended December 31, 2018, Newmark borrowed an additional $230.0 million and used these proceeds plus cash on hand to fund its restricted cash account pledged for the benefit of the Federal National Mortgage Association ( Fannie Mae\u201d). On September 4, 2018, Newmark borrowed $112.5 million in order to repay a promissory note payable to BGC of $112.5 million (the 2042 Promissory Note\u201d). On October 4, 2018, Newmark withdrew $252.0 million of cash on hand that was in excess of the minimum balance required to be pledged for the benefit of Fannie Mae to repay $252.0 million towards the outstanding balance of the Intercompany Credit Agreement. The remaining balance of $130.5 million was repaid with the proceeds of the 6.125% Senior Notes (as defined below).\nOther Operating Expenses\n \u2022 Gains from Mortgage Banking Activities/Originations, Net. Gains from mortgage banking activities/originations are derived from the origination of loans with borrowers and the sale of those loans to investors. \nRevenues\nOn March 7, 2018, BGC Partners and its operating subsidiaries purchased 16.6 million newly issued exchangeable limited partnership units (the Newmark Units\u201d) of Newmark Holdings for $242.0 million (the Investment by BGC in Newmark Holdings\u201d). See Note 27 - Related Party Transactions\u201d to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nInterest rates are also relatively low because of even lower or negative benchmark government interest rates in much of the rest of the developed world, which makes U.S. government bonds relatively more attractive.\nManagement Services, Servicing Fees and Other\nOn September 26, 2018, Newmark entered into a second agreement to issue $150.0 million of additional EPUs to RBC, similar to the June 18, 2018 transaction (together the Newmark OpCo Preferred Investment\u201d). Newmark received $113.2 million of cash with respect to this transaction.\nDebt Repayment and Credit Agreements\nvolume and a 19.9% increase in investment sales volume, both of which significantly outpaced overall industry growth volumes in the U.S.\nEquity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\nIn the past several years, Newmark has acquired approximately 50 companies. We have identified opportunities to streamline our operations and complete the integration of these various businesses. We believe the result of these actions will generate in excess of $20 million of annualized savings by the end of 2020, of which $15 million were achieved in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nThe key drivers of revenue growth for U.S. commercial real estate services companies include the overall health of the U.S. economy, institutional ownership of commercial real estate as an investible asset class, and the ability to attract and retain talent. In addition, growth in our capital markets business is driven by the availability of credit to purchasers of and investors in commercial real estate. In our multifamily business, delayed marriages, an aging population and less home ownership are driving increased demand for new apartments, with an estimated 4.6 million needed by 2030, according to a 2017 study commissioned by the National Multifamily Housing Council and the National Apartment Association. This should continue to drive investment sales, GSE multifamily lending and other mortgage brokerage and growth in our servicing portfolio for the foreseeable future. According to RealPage, developers are expected to deliver 370 thousand new apartments in 2020, up 50% from 247 thousand in 2019.\nNewmark has an investment in Real Estate LP, a joint venture with Cantor in which Newmark has a less than majority ownership and has the ability to exert significant influence over the operating and financial policies. As of December 31, 2019, Newmark had $100.0 million in this equity method investment, which represents a 27% ownership in Real Estate LP.\nDiscretionary Bonus: A portion of our compensation and employee benefits expense comprises discretionary bonuses, which may be paid in cash, equity, partnership awards or a combination thereof. We accrue expense in a period based on revenues in that period and on the expected combination of cash, equity and partnership units. Given the assumptions used in estimating discretionary bonuses, actual results may differ.\nBased on the number of shares of BGC common stock outstanding as of the close of business on the Record Date, BGC's stockholders as of the Record Date received in the Spin-Off 0.463895 of a share of Newmark Class A common stock for each share of BGC Class A common stock held as of the Record Date, and 0.463895 of a share of Newmark Class B common stock for each share of BGC Class B common stock held as of the Record Date. BGC Partners stockholders received cash in lieu of any fraction of a share of Newmark common stock that they otherwise would have received in the Spin-Off.\nThe following table details our share repurchase activity during 2019, including the total number of shares purchased, the average price paid per share, the number of shares repurchased as part of our publicly announced repurchase program and the approximate value that may yet be purchased under such program (in thousands except share and per share amounts):\nAs of January 1, 2018, Newmark had an outstanding balance of $300.0 million principal amount promissory note payable to BGC U.S. OpCo (the 2019 Promissory Note\u201d). On November 23, 2018, Newmark OpCo repaid the $300.0 million outstanding principal amount under the 2019 Promissory Note, primarily using proceeds from the sale of its 6.125% Senior Notes. Upon repayment of the 2019 Promissory Note, Newmark had no further debt obligations owed to or guaranteed by BGC, which was one of the requirements for the Spin-Off to be tax-free.\nThe Spin-Off\nIn January 2019, we filed a registration statement on Form S-4 pursuant to which the holders of our 6.125% Senior Notes which were issued in a private placement were offered an opportunity to exchange such notes for new registered notes with substantially identical terms. The registration statement was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and, on February 5, 2019, we announced an offer to exchange up to all $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6.125% Senior Notes for an equivalent amount of 6.125% Senior Notes registered under the Securities Act. The exchange offer closed on March 14, 2019, and the 6.125% Senior Notes were subsequently exchanged for notes with substantially similar terms that were registered under the Securities Act.\nNewmark entered into four variable postpaid forward contracts as a result of the Nasdaq Forwards. These contracts qualify as derivative financial instruments. The Nasdaq Forwards provide Newmark with the ability to redeem the EPUs for Nasdaq stock, and as these instruments are not legally detachable, they represent single financial instruments. The financial instruments' EPU redemption feature for Nasdaq common stock is not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of Newmark's EPU equity host instruments, and, therefore, it represents an embedded derivative that is required to be bifurcated and recorded at fair value on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets, with all changes in fair value recorded as a component of Other income (loss), net\u201d on our accompanying consolidated statements of operations. See Note 11 - Derivatives\u201d, to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nWe have entered into various agreements with certain of our employees and partners whereby these individuals receive loans, which may be either wholly or in part repaid from the distribution earnings that the individual receives on their limited partnership interests in BGC Holdings and Newmark Holdings. The forgivable portion of these loans is recognized as compensation expense over the life of the loan.\nNewmark granted conversion rights on outstanding limited partnership units in Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings to Newmark employees to convert the limited partnership units to a capital balance within Newmark Holdings or BGC Holdings. Generally, HDUs are not considered share-equivalent limited partnership units and are not in the fully diluted share count.\nPre-IPO Related Party Items\nDepreciation and Amortization\nAs of December 31, 2019, our liquidity, which Newmark defines as cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities, less securities loaned, was $163.6 million. This does not include the approximately $638.0 million in additional Nasdaq stock (stock value based on the February 12, 2020 closing price) that Newmark expects to receive between 2020 and 2027. Newmark expects to use its considerable financial resources to repay debt, profitably hire, make accretive acquisitions, pay dividends, and/or repurchase shares and units of Newmark, all while maintaining or improving its credit profile.\nAccording to Real Capital Analytics ( RCA\u201d), prices for commercial real estate were up by approximately 8% year-over-year for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year, overall U.S. commercial real estate notional sales volumes decreased by approximately 2%. In comparison, our investment sales volumes increased 19.9% year-over-year in 2019. According to a January 2020 Mortgage Bankers Association ( MBA\u201d) forecast, originations of commercial/multifamily loans of all types are projected to increase approximately 9% in terms of dollar volume for each of the years ending December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020. Our mortgage brokerage volumes were up 47.6% year-over-year in 2019 and our total debt volumes were up 34.7% to over $30 billion in 2019.\nLong-term debt consisted of the following (in thousands):\nOn September 8, 2017, BGC Partners, Inc. ( BGC\u201d or BGC Partners\u201d) acquired, from Cantor Commercial Real Estate Company, LP ( CCRE\u201d), 100% of the equity of Berkeley Point Financial LLC (the Berkeley Point Acquisition\u201d). Berkeley Point Financial LLC ( Berkeley Point\u201d or BPF\u201d) is a leading commercial real estate finance company focused on the origination and sale of multifamily and other commercial real estate loans through government-sponsored and government-funded loan programs, as well as the servicing of commercial real estate loans. On December 13, 2017, in connection with the Separation from BGC, the assets and liabilities of Berkeley Point were transferred to Newmark. See Note 27 - Related Party Transactions\u201d to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nCompensation and employee benefits expense increased by $114.0 million, or 9.8%, to $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The main driver of this increase was Newmark's continued hiring of leading industry professionals.\nWe pay fees to BGC Partners and/or Cantor for performing certain administrative and other support, including charges for occupancy of office space, utilization of fixed assets and accounting, operations, human resources, legal services and technology infrastructure support. Management believes that these charges are a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services rendered. However, the expenses for these services are not necessarily indicative of the expenses that would have been incurred if we had not obtained these services from BGC Partners or Cantor. In addition, these charges may not reflect the costs of services we may receive from BGC Partners or Cantor in the future.\nOn December 19, 2019, the Compensation Committee approved the right to (i) convert 552,483 non-exchangeable Newmark Holdings PSUs held by Mr. Lutnick into 552,483 HDUs (which, based on the closing price of the Class A common stock of $13.61 per share on such date, had a value of $7,017,000); and (ii) exchange for cash 602,463 Newmark Holdings non-exchangeable PPSUs held by Mr. Lutnick (which had an average determination price of $13.25 per unit)for a payment of $7,983,000 for taxes when (i) is exchanged.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated $853.6 million of cash from operations. We had net income of $145.1 million, $705.1 million of adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities, and $3.4 million of positive changes in operating assets and liabilities. $711.4 million of adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities was related to loans held for sale. The positive change in operating assets and liabilities was driven by a $58.9 million increase in our accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, including accrued compensation, and a $36.1 increase in other assets, partially offset by a $91.5 million negative change in operating assets and liabilities as a result of an increase in outstanding receivables and employee loans and other receivables. We generated $0.4 million of cash provided by investing activities primarily related to proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, offset by purchases of fixed assets. We used $798.2 million of cash from financing activities primarily due to net payments to related parties of $746.9 million, $101.8 million of distribution of earnings to BGC and $89.1 million distribution related to Berkeley Point acquisition, offset by $57.6 million of proceeds from secured loans.\nInterest (Expense) Income, Net\n (1) Operating leases are related to rental payments under various non-cancelable leases principally for office space. \nThe following table summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2019 (in thousands):\nThe discussion of our financial results reflects only the business owned by us and does not include the results for Knight Frank or for the independently owned offices that use some variation of the Newmark name in their branding or marketing.\nLimited Partnership Units: Limited partnership units in Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings are held by Newmark employees and receive quarterly allocations of net income and are generally contingent upon services being provided by the unit holders. As discussed above, preferred units in Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings are not entitled to participate in partnership distributions other than with respect to a distribution at a rate of either 0.6875% (which is 2.75% per calendar year) or such other amount as set forth in the award documentation. The quarterly allocations of net income to such limited partnership units are reflected as a component of compensation expense under Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nOn November 30, 2018, BGC completed the Spin-Off to its stockholders of all of the shares of the Newmark common stock owned by BGC as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Spin-Off, with shares of Newmark Class A common stock distributed to the holders of shares of BGC Class A common stock (including directors and executive officers of BGC Partners) of record as of the close of business on November 23, 2018 (the Record Date\u201d), and shares of Newmark Class B common stock distributed to the holders of shares of BGC's Class B common stock (consisting of Cantor and CF Group Management, Inc. ( CFGM\u201d) of record as of the close of business on the Record Date).\nFees are generally earned when a lease is signed. In many cases, landlords are responsible for paying the fees. In capital markets, fees are earned and recognized when the sale of a property closes, and title passes from seller to buyer for investment sales and when debt or equity is funded to a vehicle for debt and equity transactions. Gains from mortgage banking activities/originations, net are recognized when a derivative asset is recorded upon the commitment to originate a loan with a borrower and sell the loan to an investor. The derivative is recorded at fair value and includes loan origination fees, sales premiums and the estimated fair value of the expected net servicing cash flows. Gains from mortgage banking activities/originations, net are recognized net of related fees and commissions to affiliates or third-party brokers. For loans we broker, revenues are recognized when the loan is closed. Servicing fees are recognized on an accrual basis over the lives of the related mortgage loans. We typically receive monthly management fees based upon a percentage of monthly rental income generated from the property under management, or in some cases, the greater of such percentage or a minimum agreed upon fee. We are often reimbursed for our administrative and payroll costs, as well as certain out-of-pocket expenses, directly attributable to properties under management. We follow accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or U.S. GAAP\u201d, which provides guidance when accounting for reimbursements from clients and when accounting for certain contingent events for Leasing and Capital Markets transactions. See Note 3 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion.\n \u2022 Capital Markets. Our real estate capital markets business specializes in the arrangement of acquisitions and dispositions of commercial properties, as well as providing other financial services, including the arrangement of debt and equity financing, and loan sale advisory. \nNewmark's income taxes as presented are calculated on a separate return basis for the periods prior to the Spin-Off and have historically been included in BGC's U.S. federal and state tax returns or separate non-U.S. jurisdictions tax returns. Subsequent to the spin, Newmark will file its own stand-alone tax returns for its operations within these jurisdictions. The 2018 tax results reflect both the pre and post spin periods and as such Newmark's tax results as presented are not necessarily reflective of the results that Newmark would have generated on a stand-alone basis.\n6.125% Senior Notes\nDepreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $1.9 million, or 2.0%, to $97.7 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was due to a $5.9 million increase in mortgage servicing rights amortization and $1.4 million increase in fixed asset depreciation, partially offset by lower intangible asset amortization of $5.4 million.\nSee Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d herein for information related to our liquidity and capital resources.\nMSRs, Net\nIn September 2019, the SPV notified RBC of its decision to settle the first variable postpaid forward contract using the Nasdaq common stock the SPV received in November 2019 in exchange for the first tranche of the EPUs, which resulted in a payable to RBC that was settled upon receipt of Nasdaq earn-out shares. The fair value of the Nasdaq common stock that Newmark received was $98.6 million. As a result of Newmark's settlement election, Newmark reclassified $93.5 million of EPUs from \"Noncontrolling interest\" to \"Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities\" on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. On December 2, 2019, Newmark settled the first variable postpaid forward contract with 898,685 Nasdaq common stock shares, with a fair value of $93.5 million and Newmark retained 93,562 Nasdaq common stock shares. The fair value of the Nasdaq common stock held by Newmark, as of December 31, 2019 was $36.8 million and is included in Marketable securities\u201d on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\n\nImpact of Adopting Revenue Recognition Guidance\nFees to related parties decreased by $1.1 million, or 4.3%, to $25.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\n \u2022 Continued corporate employment growth, combined with increased leisure travel, generated demand for hotel room-nights.  Rising inflation and interest rates, which are byproducts of faster economic growth, could deliver a mixed outcome: potentially higher interest rates could put upward pressure on cap rates, but stronger rent growth and sustained investor demand could support higher property values and income growth.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nExchangeable Preferred Partnership Units and Forward Contracts\nYear ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017\nRestricted Stock: Restricted stock provided to certain employees is accounted for as an equity award, and as per U.S. GAAP guidance, we are required to record an expense for the portion of the restricted stock that is ultimately expected to vest. We have granted restricted stock that is not subject to continued employment or service; however, transferability is subject to compliance with our and our affiliates' customary non-compete obligations. Such shares of restricted stock are generally saleable by partners in 5 to 10 years. Because the restricted stock is not subject to continued employment or service, the grant-date fair value of the restricted stock is expensed on the date of grant. The expense is reflected as non-cash equity-based compensation expense in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nOn November 28, 2018, Newmark entered into a Credit Agreement by and among Newmark, the several financial institutions from time to time party thereto, as Lenders, and Bank of America N.A., as administrative agent. The Credit Agreement provides for a $250.0 million three-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2019, there were $50.0 of million borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the Credit Facility will bear an annual interest equal to, at Newmark's option, either (a) London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) for specified periods, or upon the consent of all Lenders, such other period that is 12 months or less, plus an applicable margin, or (b) a base rate equal to the greatest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, (ii) the prime rate as established by the administrative agent, and (iii) one-month LIBOR plus 1.0%. The applicable margin is 200 basis points with respect to LIBOR borrowings in (a) above and can range 0.25% to 1.25% higher, depending upon Newmark's credit rating. The Credit Facility also provides for an unused facility fee.\nWe generate revenues from commissions on leasing and capital markets transactions, consulting and technology user fees, property and facility management fees, and mortgage origination and loan servicing fees.\nLeasing and Other Commissions\nNewmark is a fast growing, full-service commercial real estate services business. We offer a diverse array of integrated services and products designed to meet the full needs of both real estate investors/owners and occupiers. Our investor/owner services and products include capital markets, which consists of investment sales, debt and structured finance and loan sales, agency leasing, property management, valuation and advisory, commercial real estate due diligence consulting and advisory services and government sponsored enterprise ( GSE\u201d) lending and loan servicing, mortgage broking and equity-raising. Our occupier services and products include tenant representation, real estate management technology systems, workplace and occupancy strategy, global corporate consulting services, project management, lease administration and facilities management. We enhance these services and products through innovative real estate technology solutions and data analytics that enable our clients to increase their efficiency and profits by optimizing their real estate portfolio. We have relationships with many of the world's largest commercial property owners, real estate developers and investors, as well as Fortune 500 and Forbes Global 2000 companies. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated revenues of $2.2 billion representing year-over-year growth of 8.3%.\nincluded in our fully diluted share count. The quarterly allocations of net income on Preferred Units are also reflected in compensation expense under Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations. After deduction of the Preferred Distribution, the remaining partnership units generally receive quarterly allocation of net income based on their weighted-average pro rata share of economic ownership of the operating subsidiaries. In addition, Preferred Units are granted in connection with the grant of certain limited partnership units, such as PSUs, that may be granted exchangeability to cover the withholding taxes owed by the unit holder upon such exchange. This is an acceptable alternative to the common practice among public companies of issuing the gross amount of shares to employees, subject to cashless withholding of shares to pay applicable withholding taxes.\nCredit Rating\nIn relation to the IPO, on December 13, 2017, Newmark entered into an exchange agreement with Cantor, CFGM, BGC and other Cantor affiliates entitled to hold Class B common stock, providing the right to exchange from time to time shares of Class A common stock of Newmark now owned or hereafter acquired, as applicable, on a one-for-one basis for shares of Class B common stock, up to the number of shares of Newmark Class B common stock that are authorized but unissued under Newmark's certificate of incorporation. The Newmark Audit Committee and Board of Directors have determined that the exchange agreement is in the best interests of Newmark and its stockholders because, among other things, it will help ensure that Cantor retains its exchangeable limited partnership units in Newmark Holdings, which is the same partnership in which Newmark's partner employees participate, thus continuing to align the interests of Cantor with those of the partner employees.\nDuring 2019, our headcount grew 8%. During 2018 and 2019 we hired over 100 top producers to the platform with average annual production in excess of $2.0 million. Based on their strong track record of revenue generation, we expect these new hires will help us achieve our growth and productivity targets over the coming years. As we continue to generate a higher percentage of our revenues from recurring businesses, we no longer plan to highlight our broker productivity metric beginning in 2020. This is consistent with our full service peers.\nOn February 26, 2020, Newmark entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement (the Amended Credit Agreement\u201d), increasing the size of the Credit Facility to $425.0 million ( the Amended Credit Facility\u201d) and extending the maturity date to February 26, 2023. The interest rate on the Amended Credit Facility is LIBOR plus 1.75% per annum, subject to a pricing grid linked to Newmark's credit ratings from Standard & Poor's and Fitch.\nThe U.S. economy expanded by 2.3% during 2019, according to a preliminary estimate from the U.S. Department of Commerce. This growth compares with an increase of 2.9% during 2018. The consensus is for U.S. gross domestic product to expand by 1.8% in 2020 and 1.9% in 2021, according to a recent Bloomberg survey of economists. This moderate pace of growth should help keep interest rates and inflation low by historical standards.\nthan leasing advisory transactions, while leasing advisory revenues are generally more predictable than revenues from capital markets. Property and facilities management, along with certain of our other Global Corporate Services ( GCS\u201d) products, generally have the most predictable and steady revenues, although pre-tax earnings margins for property and facilities management are at the lower end of those for our business as a whole. When management services clients agree to give us exclusive rights to provide real estate services for their facilities or properties, it is for an extended period, which provides us with stable and foreseeable sources of revenues. Newmark's revenues are balanced between businesses that are relatively less predictable and contractual sources that are very predictable. Approximately 67% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 were generated by our most predictable and highly visible sources, including agency leasing, valuation, GCS, management services, loan servicing and tenant representation leasing business. The remaining 33% of revenues were generated by our more transactional investment sales, mortgage brokerage, and GSE lending platforms. Despite being more transactional, there are $2.1 trillion of mortgage maturities between 2020 and 2024 which we believe will support strong levels of mortgage brokerage and origination activities. Our debt volume increased by 34.7% year-on-year to $30.6 billion in 2019.\nIn December 2017, prior to our Separation and IPO, all intercompany arrangements and agreements that were previously approved by the Audit Committee of BGC Partners with respect to BGC Partners and its subsidiaries and Cantor and its subsidiaries were also approved by our Board of Directors with respect to the relationships between us and our subsidiaries and Cantor and its subsidiaries following our IPO on the terms and conditions approved by the BGC Audit Committee during such time that our business was owned by BGC Partners. These arrangements include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) an authorization to provide Cantor real estate and related services, including real estate advice, brokerage, property or facilities management, appraisals and valuations and other services; (ii) an authorization to enter into brokerage and similar agreements with respect to the provision of ordinary course brokerage services in circumstances in which such entities customarily provide brokerage services to third-party customers; (iii) an authorization to enter into agreements with Cantor and/or its affiliates, to provide services, including finding and reviewing suitable acquisition or partner candidates, structuring transactions and negotiating and due diligence services in connection with acquisitions and other business strategies in commercial real estate and other businesses from time to time; and (iv) an arrangement to jointly manage exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates. Please see the section entitled Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\u201d in BGC Partners' Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A for its 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders filed on April 29, 2019 for a description of these and other approved arrangements.\nNewmark has a stand-alone BBB- stable credit rating from Fitch Ratings, Inc. and Kroll Bond Rating Agency, as well as a BB+ stable rating from Standard & Poor's.\nIn connection with the expansion of our mortgage brokerage and lending activities, Newmark has entered into an agreement with Cantor pursuant to which five former employees of its affiliate, CCRE, have transferred to Newmark, effective as of May 1, 2018. In connection with this transfer of employees, Cantor paid $6.9 million to Newmark in October 2018 and Newmark Holdings issued $6.7 million of limited partnership units and $0.2 million of cash in the form of a cash distribution agreement to the employees. In addition, Newmark Holdings issued $2.2 million of Newmark Holdings partnership units with a\n (5) Interest on the warehouse facilities collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises was projected by using the 1-month LIBOR rate plus their respective additional basis points, primarily 115 basis points above LIBOR, applied to their respective outstanding balances as of December 31, 2019, through their respective maturity dates. Their respective maturity dates range from June 2020 to October 2020, while one line has an open maturity date. The notional amount of these committed and uncommitted warehouse facilities was $1.8 billion at December 31, 2019. One warehouse facility, with an initial notional amount of $450.0 million, was temporarily increased by $350.0 million to $800.0 million for the period January 13, 2020 to March 30, 2020. Another warehouse facility, with an initial notional amount of $400.0 million, was temporarily increased by $100.0 million to $500.0 million for the period January 29, 2020 to March 13, 2020.  As of December 31, 2019, Newmark was committed to fund approximately $1.5 billion, which is the total remaining draws on construction loans originated by Newmark under the Housing and Urban Development ( HUD\u201d) 221(d)4, 220 and 232 programs, rate locked loans that have not been funded, and forward commitments, as well as the funding for Fannie Mae\nOther income, net is comprised of the gains associated with the Earn-out shares related to the Nasdaq transaction and the movements related to the impact of any unrealized non-cash mark-to-market gains or losses related to the Nasdaq Forwards. Additionally, other income includes gains (losses) on equity method investments which represent our pro rata share of the net gains (losses) on investments over which we have significant influence but which we do not control, and the mark-to-market gains or losses on the non-marketable investments accounted for pursuant to the measurement alternative under Accounting Standards Update 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.\nThe primary source of liquidity for our business is the cash flow provided by our operations.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\ninvestment in Newmark, net proceeds from 6.125% Senior Notes of $537.5 million, $262.2 million proceeds from the Newmark OpCo Preferred Investment, partially offset by distributions to limited partnership interests and noncontrolling interests of $46.5 million, and dividends of $41.8 million, and $1,156.0 million repayment of long-term debt.\nNewmark is subject to various capital requirements in connection with seller/servicer agreements that Newmark has entered into with the various GSEs. Failure to maintain minimum capital requirements could result in Newmark's inability to originate and service loans for the respective GSEs and could have a direct material adverse effect on our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2019, Newmark has met all capital requirements. As of December 31, 2019, the most restrictive capital requirement was Fannie Mae's net worth requirement. Newmark exceeded the minimum requirement by $299.9 million.\nWe continue to invest in the business by adding high profile and talented producers and other revenue-generating professionals. Historically, newly hired commercial real estate producers tend to achieve dramatically higher productivity in their second and third years with our company, although we incur related expenses immediately. As our newly hired producers increase their production, we expect our commission revenue and earnings growth to accelerate, thus reflecting our operating leverage. Our pre-tax margins are impacted by the mix of revenues generated. For example, servicing revenues tend to have higher pre-tax margins than Newmark as a whole and margins from Gains from mortgage banking activities/originations, net\u201d tend to be lower as we retain rights to service loans over time. In addition, capital markets, which includes sales, commercial mortgage broking, and other real estate-related financial services, generally has larger transactions that occur with less frequency and visibility when compared with leasing advisory. Capital markets transactions tend to have higher pre-tax margins\nOn January 1, 2019, Newmark adopted ASC 842 Leases ( ASC 842\u201d), which provides guidance on the accounting and disclosure for accounting for leases. Newmark has elected the optional transition method, and pursuant to this transition method, financial information will not be updated and the disclosures required under the new standard will not be provided for dates and periods prior to January 1, 2019. Newmark has elected the package of practical expedients,\u201d which permits Newmark not to reassess under the new standard its prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. Newmark has elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify, and has elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all leases other than real estate leases.\nDepreciation and Amortization\n (1) Amounts include the gains related to the Nasdaq Earn-out associated with the Nasdaq monetization transactions recorded in Other income (loss), net.  Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOn December 19, 2019, the Audit and Compensation Committees of the Board of Directors authorized and the Company executed the repurchase from Mr. Merkel of 132,429 shares of Newmark Class A common stock at $13.61 per share, the closing price on December 19, 2019.\nOn November 6, 2018, Newmark closed its offering of $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Senior Notes due 2023 ( 6.125% Senior Notes\u201d). The 6.125% Senior Notes are general senior unsecured obligations of Newmark. The 6.125% Senior Notes, which were priced on November 1, 2018 at 98.937% to yield 6.375%, were offered and sold by Newmark in a private offering exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act. Newmark received net proceeds of $537.6 million, net of debt issue costs and debt discount. The 6.125% Senior Notes bear an interest rate of 6.125% per annum, payable on each May 15 and November 15, beginning on May 15, 2019 and will mature on November 15, 2023. Newmark used the net proceeds to repay the remaining balance of the Converted Term Loan of $133.9 million, the balance of\n(1)The components of Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs are as follows (in thousands): \nAs of January 1, 2018, Newmark had an outstanding balance of $270.7 million under a committed unsecured senior term loan credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders. The term loan credit agreement provided for loans of up to $575.0 million (the Term Loan\u201d). Newmark used the proceeds of the Investment in Newmark Holdings plus cash on hand to repay in full the Term Loan.\nOn June 18, 2018, Newmark's principal operating subsidiary, Newmark OpCo, issued $175.0 million of exchangeable preferred partnership units ( EPUs\u201d) in a private transaction to the Royal Bank of Canada ( RBC\u201d). Newmark received $152.9 million of cash with respect to this transaction.\nOther Income, Net\nLeasing and other commission revenues increased by $200.5 million, or 32.5%, to $817.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was due to organic growth.\nLeasing and Other Commissions\nSeparation and Distribution and Related Agreements\nCertain of these limited partnership units entitle the holders to receive post-termination payments. These limited partnership units are accounted for as post-termination liability awards under U.S. GAAP guidance, which requires that we record an expense for such awards based on the change in value at each reporting period and include the expense in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations as part of Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d. The liability for limited partnership units with a post-termination payout amount is included in Other long-term liabilities\u201d on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nRegistration Statements\nBecause the Company recognizes OMSR gains equal to the fair value of servicing rights retained on mortgage loans originated and sold, it also amortizes MSRs in proportion to the net servicing revenue expected to be earned. Subsequent to the initial recording, MSRs are amortized and carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. For the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our expenses included $78.4 million and $72.5 million of MSR amortization, respectively.\n\nCredit Facility\nthe Intercompany Credit Agreement of $130.5 million, and a portion of the 2019 Promissory Note (as defined below). The 6.125% Senior Notes were subsequently exchanged for notes with substantially similar terms that were registered under the Securities Act. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the carrying amount of the 6.125% Senior Notes was $540.4 million and $537.9 million, respectively.\nCompensation and Employee Benefits\nFees to Related Parties\n (1) Includes payments for corporate taxes in the amounts of $95.1 million, $1.2 million and $0.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. \n \u2022 the BGC Holdings distribution; and \nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606\u201d), which provides accounting guidance on the recognition of revenues from contracts with customers and impacts the presentation of certain revenues and expenses in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Newmark elected to adopt ASC 606 using a modified retrospective approach with regard to contracts that were not completed as of December 31, 2017, and prospectively from January 1, 2018 onward. Due to the adoption of ASC 606, for all periods from the first quarter of 2018 onward, Newmark did not and will not record revenues or earnings related to Leasing and other commissions\u201d with respect to contingent revenue expected to be received in future periods as of December 31, 2017, in relation to contracts signed prior to January 1, 2018, for which services have already been completed. Instead, Newmark recorded this contingent revenue and related commission payments on the balance sheet on January 1, 2018, with a corresponding pre-tax improvement of $22.7 million and Newmark recognized an increase of $16.5 million and $2.3 million to beginning retained earnings and noncontrolling interests, respectively, as a cumulative effect of adoption of an accounting change.\nA portion of our gains from mortgage banking activities, net, relate to non-cash gains attributable to OMSRs. We recognize OMSR gains equal to the fair value of servicing rights retained on mortgage loans originated and sold. For the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recognized $103.2 million and $121.0 million of non-cash gains, respectively, related to OMSRs.\nIn addition, as a servicer for Fannie Mae, the Government National Mortgage Association ( Ginnie Mae\u201d) and FHA, Newmark is required to advance to investors any uncollected principal and interest due from borrowers. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, outstanding borrower advances were $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively, and are included in Other assets\u201d in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nBoth the commitment to extend credit and the forward sale commitment qualify as derivative financial instruments. We recognize all derivatives on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities measured at fair value. The change in the derivatives fair value is recognized in current period earnings.\nCapital Markets\nFinancial Overview\nIn June 2019, we completed the acquisition of ACRES, a commercial brokerage and management firm headquartered in Utah. ACRES operates offices in Salt Lake City, Utah; Boise, Idaho; and Reno, Nevada.\nFees to Related Parties\nTransfer of Employees to Newmark and Other Related Party Transactions\n \u2022 the pro rata distribution in the Spin-Off of the shares of Newmark Class A common stock and the shares of Newmark Class B common stock held by BGC, pursuant to which shares of Newmark Class A common stock held by BGC would be distributed to the holders of shares of BGC Class A common stock and shares of Newmark Class B common stock held by BGC would be distributed to the holders of shares of BGC Class B common stock. The Spin-Off distribution is intended to qualify as generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  As part of the Separation described above, BGC contributed its interests in BPF and Real Estate L.P. to Newmark.\nWe incur income tax expenses based on the location, legal structure, and jurisdictional taxing authorities of each of our subsidiaries. Certain of the Company's entities are taxed as U.S. partnerships and are subject to the Unincorporated Business Tax (which we refer to as UBT\u201d) in New York City. U.S. federal and state income tax liability or benefit related to the partnership income or loss, with the exception of UBT, rests with the partners (See Note 2 - Limited Partnership Interests in Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings\u201d, to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.) rather than the partnership entity. Our accompanying consolidated financial statements include U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on the Company's allocable share of the U.S. results of operations. Outside of the U.S., we operate principally through subsidiary corporations subject to local income taxes.\nA portion of our gains from mortgage banking activities, net, relate to non-cash gains attributable to OMSRs. We recognize OMSR gains equal to the fair value of servicing rights retained on mortgage loans originated and sold. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recognized $109.2 million and $103.2 million of non-cash gains, respectively, related to OMSRs. As with originations, OMSR gains are also impacted by the product mix.\nThe ten-year Treasury yield declined by approximately 77 basis points to 1.92% as of December 31, 2019 versus the year-earlier date. Ten-year Treasury yields have remained well below their 50-year average of approximately 6.32% due to market expectations that the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC\u201d) will lower the federal funds rate over the next year in addition to muted long-term inflation expectations. On October 30, 2019, the FOMC reduced the target range for the federal funds rate to between 1.50% and 1.75%.\nWe derive our revenues primarily through commissions from brokerage services, gains from mortgage banking activities/originations, net, revenues from real estate management services, servicing fees and other revenues. Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when, or as, Newmark satisfies its performance obligations by transferring the promised goods or services to the customers as determined by when, or as, the customer obtains control of that good or service. A performance obligation may be satisfied over time or at a point in time. Revenue from a performance obligation satisfied over time is recognized by measuring Newmark's progress in satisfying the performance obligation as evidenced by the transfer of the goods or services to the customer. Revenue from a performance obligation satisfied at a point in time is recognized at the point in time when the customer obtains control over the promised good or service. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those promised goods or services (i.e., the transaction price\u201d). In determining the transaction price, we consider consideration promised in a contract that includes a variable amount, referred to as variable consideration, and estimate the amount of consideration due Newmark. Additionally, variable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. In determining when to include variable consideration in the transaction price, Newmark considers all information (historical, current and forecast) that is available, including the range of possible outcomes, the predictive value of past experiences, the time period of when uncertainties expect to be resolved and the amount of consideration that is susceptible to factors outside of Newmark's influence.\nOn December 31, 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the monetization of 898,080 BGC Holdings, PPSUs held by Mr. Lutnick (which had an average determination price of $7.65 per unit), and 592,721 Newmark Holdings PPSUs (which had an average determination price of $13.715 per unit), which transactions had an aggregate value of $15,000,000. On February 6, 2019, the Compensation Committee approved a modification which consisted of the following: (i) the right to exchange 1,131,774 non-exchangeable BGC Holdings PSUs held by Mr. Lutnick into 1,131,774 HDUs (which, based on the closing price of the BGC Class A common stock of $6.20 per share on such date, had a value of $7,017,000); and (ii) the right to exchange for cash 1,018,390 BGC Holdings non-exchangeable PPSUs held by Mr. Lutnick, (which had an average determination price of $7.8388 per unit), for a payment of $7,983,000 for taxes when (i) is exchanged.\nCash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nOn November 30, 2018, BGC Partners also caused its subsidiary, BGC Holdings, to distribute pro rata (the BGC Holdings distribution\u201d) all of the 1,458,931 exchangeable limited partnership units of Newmark Holdings held by BGC Holdings immediately prior to the effective time of the BGC Holdings distribution to its limited partners entitled to receive distributions on their BGC Holdings units (including Cantor and executive officers of BGC) who were holders of record of such units as of the Record Date. The Newmark Holdings units distributed to BGC Holdings partners in the BGC Holdings distribution are exchangeable for shares of Newmark Class A common stock, and in the case of the 449,917 Newmark Holdings units received by Cantor also into shares of Newmark Class B common stock, at the applicable exchange ratio (subject to\nTotal liabilities at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $2,239.4 million and $2,371.2 million, respectively. The decrease of $131.8 million can be attributed to a decrease in warehouse facilities collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored\nNewmark provides for uncertain tax positions based upon management's assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. Management is required to determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Because significant assumptions are used in determining whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities, actual results may differ from Newmark's estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Newmark recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in Provision for income taxes\u201d in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated $986.8 million of cash from operations. However, excluding activity from loan originations and sales, net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $211.2 million. We had consolidated net income of $161.7 million, $222.6 million of positive adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash used by operating activities (excluding activity from loan originations and sales) and $173.1 million of negative changes in operating assets and liabilities. The negative change in operating assets and liabilities included $161.9 million of increases in loans, forgivable loans and other receivables from employees and partners primarily related to continued hiring and expansion of our business, $113.2 million of increases in other assets, and $52.0 million of increase in receivables, net, offset by an increase of $130.7 million in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities and an increase of $23.4 million in payables to related parties. Cash used in investing activities was $56.8 million, primarily related to $34.5 million in purchases of fixed assets, $33.9 million of payments for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, $28.0 million in purchases of non-marketable investments, net, partially offset by $32.6 million of proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, and $8.6 million of distributions from Real Estate L.P. We used $895.5 million of cash from financing activities primarily due to net repayments on the warehouse facilities collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises of $762.7 million, distributions to limited partnership interests and other noncontrolling interests of $140.6 million, dividends to stockholders of $69.2 million and treasury stock repurchases of $37.4 million, partially offset by net borrowings under the Credit Facility of $50.0 million, the settlement of pre-Spin-Off related party receivables of $33.9 million, and proceeds from securities loaned of $36.7 million.\nGains from mortgage banking activities, net increased by $15.8 million, or 8.7%, to $198.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in GSE loan origination volume of $1.4 billion, or 16.1%, to $9.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. As with other multifamily agency lenders, Newmark's mix of originations, and therefore revenues, can vary depending on the size of loans, as well by the categories of loans with respect to the FHA, Freddie Mac, and different Fannie Mae structures.\nWe have invested significantly to capitalize on the current business environment through acquisitions, technology spending and the hiring of new producers, salespeople, managers and other front-office personnel. The business climate for these acquisitions has been competitive, and it is expected that these conditions will persist for the foreseeable future. We have been able to attract businesses and producers, salespeople, managers and other front-office personnel to our platform as we believe they recognize that we have the scale, technology, experience and expertise to succeed in the current business environment. See Item 1 - Business-Our History\u201d for a description of our acquisitions since 2017.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests\nCash flows from operations excluding activity from loan originations and sales, net were as follows (in thousands):\nOn December 19, 2019, the Compensation Committee approved the cancellation of 145,464 non-exchangeable Newmark Holdings PSUs held by Mr. Merkel, and the cancellation of 178,179 non-exchangeable PPSUs (which had an\nThe majority of our operating costs consist of cash and non-cash compensation expenses, which include base salaries, producer commissions based on production, forgivable loans for term contracts, discretionary and other bonuses and all related employee benefits and taxes. Our employees consist of commissioned producers, executives and other administrative support. Our producers are largely compensated based on the revenue they generate for the firm, keeping these costs variable in nature.\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\nWe simultaneously enter into an agreement to deliver such mortgages to third-party investors at a fixed price (forward sale contracts).\nOn November 30, 2018, Newmark entered into an unsecured credit agreement (the Cantor Credit Agreement\u201d) with Cantor. The Cantor Credit Agreement provides for each party to issue loans to the other party in the lender's discretion. Pursuant to the Cantor Credit Agreement, the parties and their respective subsidiaries (with respect to CFLP, other than BGC and its subsidiaries) may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $250.0 million from each other from time to time at an interest rate which is the higher of Cantor's or the Company's short-term borrowing rate then in effect, plus 1.0%.\nThis discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations and financial condition during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. We operate in one reportable segment, real estate services. This discussion is provided to increase the understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.\nCertain limited partnership units are granted exchangeability into Class A common stock or may be redeemed in connection with the grant of shares of Class A common stock. At the time exchangeability is granted, or the shares are issued, Newmark recognizes an expense based on the fair value of the award on that date, which is included in Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nTotal assets at December 31, 2019 were $3,201.5 million as compared to $3,454.2 million at December 31, 2018. The decrease of $252.6 million can be attributed to a decrease in loans held for sale, at fair value of $775.6 million, offset by an increase in ROU assets of $201.7 million, an increase in loans from employees and partners of $118.2 million related to our continued hiring of industry leading professionals, an increase in other assets of $71.4 million and an increase in receivables, net of $56.8 million.\n \u2022 Sustained U.S. employment growth and rising home values have fueled the economy and generated demand for commercial real estate; \nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nOperating, Administrative and Other\nOur employees have been awarded preferred partnership units ( Preferred Units\u201d) in Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings. Each quarter, the net profits of Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings are allocated to such units at a rate of either 0.6875% (which is 2.75% per calendar year) or such other amount as set forth in the award documentation (the Preferred Distribution\u201d), which is deducted before the calculation and distribution of the quarterly partnership distribution for the remaining partnership units in Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings, respectively. The Preferred Units are not entitled to participate in partnership distributions other than with respect to the Preferred Distribution. Preferred Units may not be made exchangeable into our Class A common stock and are only entitled to the Preferred Distribution, and accordingly they are not\nFully Diluted Share Count\nOn December 19, 2019, the Compensation Committee approved the right to (i) convert 5,846 non-exchangeable Newmark Holdings PSUs held by Mr. Rispoli into 5,846 HDUs (which, based on the closing price of the Class A common stock of $13.61 per share on such date, had a value of $74,250); and (ii) exchange for cash 4,917 Newmark Holdings non-exchangeable PPSUs held by Mr. Rispoli (which had an average determination price of $12.355 per unit) for a payment of $60,750 for taxes when (i) is exchanged.\nOn June 28, 2013, BGC sold certain assets of its on-the-run, electronic benchmark U.S. Treasury platform ( eSpeed\u201d) to Nasdaq. The total consideration received in the transaction included $750.0 million in cash paid upon closing and an Earn-out of up to 14,883,705 shares of Nasdaq common stock to be paid ratably over 15 years, provided that Nasdaq, as a whole, produces at least $25.0 million in consolidated gross revenues each year. Nasdaq generated gross revenues of approximately $4.3 billion in 2019. The remaining rights under the Nasdaq Earn-out were transferred to Newmark on September 28, 2017. See Note 7 - Marketable Securities\u201d to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nManagement services, servicing fees and other revenue increased $203.2 million, or 54.1%, to $579.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. $86.2 million of the increase was related to additional pass-through revenues resulting from the implementation of ASC 606, while $59.5 million was related to the valuation and advisory business. Additionally, $21.3 million or 19.3% of the increase was related to servicing fee revenues, which includes interest income of $9.0 million on Loans held for sale.\nNewmark accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method as prescribed in U.S. GAAP guidance, Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to basis differences between our accompanying consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Certain of Newmark's entities are taxed as U.S. partnerships and are subject to UBT in New York City. Therefore, the tax liability or benefit related to the partnership income or loss except for UBT rests with the partners, rather than the partnership entity. As such, the partners' tax liability or benefit is not reflected in our accompanying consolidated financial statements. The tax-related assets, liabilities, provisions or benefits included in our accompanying consolidated financial statements also reflect the results of the entities that are taxed as corporations, either in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions.\nCompensation and Employee Benefits\nFees to related parties that are charged by BGC Partners and/or Cantor to Newmark are reflected as cash flows from operating activities in our accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows for each period presented. All other amounts sent to or from BGC Partners and Cantor are reflected as cash flows from financing activities in our accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows for each period presented.\nOperating, administrative and other expenses increased $30.1 million, or 9.1%, to $361.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily driven by increases in selling and promotional and other expenses associated with acquisitions and new hires, an increase in interest expense on the warehouse facilities collateralized by GSEs of $3.8 million, which is partially offset by the increase in interest income on Loans held for sale, at fair value.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was $986.8 million. However, excluding activity from loan originations and sales, net cash provided by operating activities was $211.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. We expect to generate cash flows from operations to fund our business operations and growth strategy to meet our short-term liquidity requirements, which we define as the next 12 months. We also expect that cash flows from operations, cash on hand, and our $250.0 million Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our operations, growth strategy and dividends and distributions to meet our long-term liquidity requirements.\nAs part of our compensation plans, certain employees have been granted limited partnership units in Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings, which generally receive quarterly allocations of net income and are generally contingent upon services being provided by the unit holders. Certain Newmark employees also hold non-distribution earnings units (e.g. NPSUs and NREUs, collectively N Units\u201d) that do not participate in quarterly partnership distributions and are not allocated any items of profit or loss. These N Units vest into distribution earnings units over a 4-year period. As prescribed in U.S. GAAP guidance, the quarterly allocations of net income on such limited partnership units are reflected as a component of compensation expense under Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations. During 2019, Newmark simplified its compensation structure when hiring new personnel by issuing restricted stock units in lieu of limited partnership units. Newmark continues to monitor its compensation policy and make changes where necessary to attract industry leading producers to Newmark.\nCapital markets revenue increased by $71.2 million, or 17.9%, to $468.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was driven by strong improvement in volumes for the investment sales and mortgage brokerage business.\n \u2022 the assumption and repayment of indebtedness by the BGC Group and the Newmark Group, as further described below; \n \u2022 Leasing and Other Commissions. We offer a diverse range of commercial real estate brokerage and advisory services, including tenant and agency representation, which includes comprehensive lease negotiations, strategic planning, site selection, lease auditing, and other financial and market analysis. \nCash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2018\n (3) Long-term debt reflects long-term borrowings of $550.0 million 6.125% Senior Notes. The carrying amount of these notes was approximately $540.4 million. Long-term debt also includes the borrowings under the Credit Facility, which is assumed to be outstanding until the maturity date of the Credit Facility. The carrying amount of the borrowings under the Credit Facility is $48.9 million. (See Note 22 - Long-Term Debt\u201d to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.) \nWe have loan commitments to extend credit to third parties. The commitments to extend credit are for mortgage loans at a specific rate (rate lock commitments). These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require a fee. We are committed to extend credit to the counterparty as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the commitment contracts.\nOperating, administrative and other expenses increased $112.6 million, or 51.4%, to $331.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily driven by $86.2 million directly related to additional pass-through expenses resulting from the implementation of ASC 606. Additionally, interest expense on the warehouse facilities collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises increased $7.3 million, which is commensurate with the increase in interest income on Loans held for sale.\n\nPrior to and in connection with the Spin-Off, 14.8 million Newmark Units held by BGC were exchanged into 9.4 million shares of Newmark Class A common stock and 5.4 million shares of Newmark Class B common stock, and 7.0 million Newmark OpCo Units held by BGC were exchanged into 6.9 million shares of Newmark Class A common stock. These Newmark Class A and Class B shares of common stock were included in the Spin-Off to BGC's stockholders.\nA valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if it is deemed more likely than not that those assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, Newmark considers all available evidence, including past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies.\nResults of Operations\nThe preparation of our accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP guidance requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our accompanying consolidated financial statements. These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, our accompanying consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows could be materially affected. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.\nExpenses\nThe first step of the process involves comparing each reporting unit's estimated fair value with its carrying value, including goodwill. To estimate the fair value of the reporting units, we use a discounted cash flow model and data regarding market comparables. The valuation process requires significant judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These assumptions include cash flow projections, estimated cost of capital and the selection of peer companies and relevant multiples. Because significant assumptions and estimates are used in projecting future cash flows, choosing peer companies and selecting relevant multiples, actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is deemed not to be impaired. If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of potential impairment.\nIn some instances, Newmark performs services for customers and incurs out-of-pocket expenses as part of delivering those services. Newmark's customers agree to reimburse Newmark for those expenses, and those reimbursements are part of the contract's transaction price. Consequently, these expenses and the reimbursements of such expenses from the customer are presented on a gross basis because the services giving rise to the out-of-pocket expenses do not transfer a good or service. The reimbursements are included in the transaction price when the costs are incurred, and the reimbursements are due from the customer.\nOn March 28, 2019, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 pursuant to which CF&Co may make offers and sales of our 6.125% Senior Notes in connection with ongoing market-making transactions which may occur from time to time. Such market-making transactions in these securities may occur in the open market or may be privately negotiated at prevailing market prices at a time of resale or at related or negotiated prices. Neither CF&Co, nor any of our affiliates, has any obligation to make a market in our securities, and CF&Co or any such other affiliate may discontinue market-making activities at any time without notice. Newmark does not receive any proceeds from market-making activities in these securities by CF&Co (or any of its affiliates).\nadjustment). As of December 31, 2019, the exchange ratio was 0.9400 shares of Newmark common stock per Newmark Holdings unit.\nInterest expense, net decreased by $18.1 million to $32.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Interest expense decreased due to the reduction in our long-term debt.\nThe fair value of RSU awards to employees is determined on the date of grant, based on the fair value of our Class A common stock. Generally, RSUs granted by us as employee compensation do not receive dividend equivalents; as such, we adjust the fair value of the RSUs for the present value of expected forgone dividends, which requires us to include an estimate of expected dividends as a valuation input. This grant-date fair value is amortized to expense ratably over the awards' vesting periods. For RSUs with graded vesting features, we have made an accounting policy election to recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis. The amortization is reflected as non-cash equity-based compensation expense in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nEQUITY\n \u2022 Technology, professional and business services and healthcare continued to power demand for office space; \nEquity-Based and Other Compensation\nHiring and Acquisitions\nMarket Statistics\nSeparation, Initial Public Offering, and Spin-Off\nNewmark completed acquisitions for which contingent cash consideration of $29.3 million and limited partnership units of 0.4 million may be issued on certain targets being met through 2022. The contingent equity instruments are included in the Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities\u201d on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The contingent cash liability is recorded at fair value as deferred consideration on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nNewmark's Compensation Committee may grant various equity-based awards to employees of Newmark, including restricted stock units, limited partnership units and exchange rights for shares of Newmark's Class A common stock upon exchange of Newmark limited partnership units (See Note 2 - Limited Partnership Interests in Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings\u201d, to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). On December 13, 2017, as part of the Separation, the Newmark Group, Inc. Long Term Incentive Plan (the Newmark Equity Plan\u201d) was approved by Newmark's sole stockholder at the time, BGC, for Newmark to issue up to 400.0 million aggregate number of shares of Class A common stock of Newmark, of which 65.0 million are pursuant to effective registration statements on Form S-8 that may be delivered or cash-settled pursuant to awards granted during the life of the Newmark Equity Plan. As of December 31, 2019, awards with respect to 20.8 million shares have been granted and 379.2 million shares are available for future awards.\naverage determination price of $10.61 per unit). Additionally, on December 19, 2019, Mr. Merkel exchanged 4,222 already exchangeable Newmark Holdings PSUs held by him in exchange for Class A common stock. The above transaction resulted in income of $3,791,848 for Mr. Merkel, of which the Company withheld $1,989,483 for taxes and issued the remaining $1,802,365 in the form of 132,429 net shares of Class A common stock at a price of $13.61 per share.\nIncome Taxes\nCash Flows\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was $85.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was attributable to the change in Newmark's corporate structure related to the Separation.\nFinancial Highlights\nFollowing the Spin-Off and the BGC Holdings distribution, BGC Partners ceased to be our controlling stockholder, and BGC and its subsidiaries no longer held any shares of our common stock or other equity interests in us or our subsidiaries. Therefore, BGC no longer consolidates Newmark with its financial results subsequent to the Spin-Off. Cantor continues to control Newmark and its subsidiaries following the Spin-Off and the BGC Holdings distribution.\nThe following key trends drove the commercial real estate market during 2019:\nIn December 2019, we completed the acquisition of Harper Dennis Hobbs Holdings Limited, a tenant-focused real estate advisory services firm, based in London.\nGoodwill\nadvances to be repaid in full from the future distributions on existing and future awards granted. The allocations of net income to the awards are treated as compensation expense and the proceeds from distributions are used to repay the loan. The forgivable portion of any loans is recognized as compensation expense in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations over the life of the loan. We review the loan balances each reporting period for collectability. If we determine that the collectability of a portion of the loan balances is not expected, we recognize a reserve against the loan balances. Actual collectability of loan balances may differ from our estimates. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the aggregate balance of employee loans, net of reserve, was $403.7 million and $285.5 million, respectively, and is included as Loans, forgivable loans and other receivables from employees and partners, net\u201d in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Compensation expense for the above-mentioned employee loans for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 were $39.0 million, $27.7 million, and $34.4 million, respectively. The compensation expense related to these loans was included as part of Compensation and employee benefits\u201d in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nOur fully diluted weighted-average share count for the year ended December 31, 2019 was as follows (in thousands):\n\nInterest expense of $50.2 million incurred during the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily related to $58.4 million of interest expense on Newmark's debt, which included a $7.0 million prepayment fee on long- term debt repaid as part of the Spin-Off. This was partially offset by $4.7 million of interest income primarily related to interest income on employee loans and $3.8 million of interest earned on bank deposits.\nCapital markets revenue increased by $72.4 million, or 15.4%, to $541.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was driven by a 47.6% increase in mortgage brokerage\n\nEquity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs increased by $34.2 million, or 15.2%, to $258.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily driven by an increase of $32.9 million in equity amortization.\n (2) Reclassifications have been made to previously reported amounts to conform to the new presentation.  Year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018\nSee Note 1 - Organization and Basis of Presentation\u201d, to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements.\n\nBecause Newmark recognizes OMSR gains equal to the fair value of servicing rights retained on mortgage loans originated and sold, it also amortizes MSRs in proportion to the net servicing revenue expected to be earned. Subsequent to the initial recording, MSRs are amortized and carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our expenses included $101.5 million and $78.4 million of MSR amortization, respectively. $17.1 million of the increase in MSR amortization was due to an impairment of the MSR to fair value resulting from a year over year decline in interest rates.\nContemporaneously with the issuance of the EPUs, the special purpose vehicle (the SPV\u201d) that is a consolidated subsidiary of Newmark entered into four variable postpaid forward contracts with RBC (together, the Nasdaq Forwards\u201d). The SPV is an indirect subsidiary of Newmark whose sole assets are the Nasdaq Earn-outs for 2019 through 2022. The Nasdaq Forwards provide the SPV the option to settle using up to 992,247 shares of Nasdaq common stock, to be received by the SPV pursuant to the Nasdaq Earn-out (See Note 7 - Marketable Securities\u201d to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), or Newmark Class A common stock, in exchange for either cash or redemption of the EPUs, notice of which must be provided to RBC prior to November 1 of each year from 2019 through 2022.\n \u2022 Management Services, Servicing Fees and Other. We provide commercial services to tenants and landlords. In this business, we provide property and facilities management services along with project management, valuation and appraisal services and other consulting services, as well as technology, to customers who may also utilize our commercial real estate brokerage services. Servicing fees are derived from the servicing of loans originated by us as well as loans originated by third parties. \nThe adoption of the new guidance did not have a significant impact on our accompanying consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statements of changes in equity, and consolidated statements of cash flows.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCredit Ratings\nAccording to a preliminary report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employers added a monthly average of approximately 175 thousand net new payroll jobs during 2019, which was below the seasonally adjusted average of 193 thousand per month in 2018.\nNasdaq Monetization Transactions\nCapital Markets\nSteady economic growth and historically low interest rates have helped push vacancy rates down for the office, apartment, and industrial markets over the current economic expansion, which began in July 2009. Construction activity, while increasing, remains low compared with prior expansion cycles and low relative to demand and absorption, which means that property leasing markets continue to tighten. Overall, demand for commercial real estate remains strong. U.S. office asking rates increased by 1.3% year-over-year, according to Newmark Research.\nover the period of, the projected net servicing income. For purposes of impairment evaluation and measurement, Newmark stratifies MSRs based on predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans, primarily by investor type (Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac, FHA/GNMA, CMBS and other). To the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of a specific MSR strata, a valuation allowance is established, which is adjusted in the future as the fair value of MSRs increases or decreases. Reversals of valuation allowances cannot exceed the previously recognized impairment up to the amortized cost.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, Newmark's total revenues were $2.2 billion, an 8.3% increase, as compared to 2018. For the full year 2019, all major business lines were up as compared with 2018. More than 85% of our overall revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2019 was organic. Newmark continued to gain market share in 2019, as evidenced by its volume growth of 20% in investment sales, 48% in mortgage brokerage, and 16% in GSE originations. Total investment sales and debt increased by $16.0 billion, or 25.0% to $81.0 billion in 2019 as compared to 2018.\nIn the aggregate, BGC distributed 131,886,409 shares of our Class A common stock and 21,285,537 shares of our Class B common stock to BGC's stockholders in the Spin-Off. These shares of our common stock collectively represented approximately 94% of the total voting power of our outstanding common stock and approximately 87% of the total economics of our outstanding common stock in each case as of the Distribution Date.\n \u2022 the proportional distribution in the Separation of interests in Newmark Holdings to holders of interests in BGC Holdings; ",
