MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report to enhance the understanding of our financial condition, changes\nin financial condition, and results of operations. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements about our business, operations, and financial performance based on current plans and estimates that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections of this Annual Report titled Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a leading provider of monitored security and interactive home and business automation solutions in the U.S. and Canada. Our monitored security and automation offerings involve the installation and monitoring of security and premises automation systems designed to detect intrusion; control access; sense movement, smoke, fire, carbon monoxide, flooding, temperature, and other environmental conditions and hazards; and address personal emergencies such as injuries, medical emergencies, or incapacitation. Our products and services include interactive technologies to allow our customers to remotely monitor and manage their residential and commercial environments by adding automation capabilities to our monitored security systems. Through our interactive offerings, customers are able to remotely access information regarding the security of their residential or commercial environment, arm and disarm their security system, adjust lighting or thermostat levels, or view real-time video from cameras covering different areas of their premises via web-enabled devices (such as smart phones, laptops, and tablet computers) and a customized web portal. Additionally, our interactive automation solutions enable customers to create customized schedules or automation for managing lights, thermostats, appliances, and garage doors. The system can also be programmed to perform additional functions such as recording and viewing live video and sending text messages based on triggering events.\nOur goal is to extend the concept of security from the physical home or business to cybersecurity and personal on-the-go security and safety. Customers' increasingly mobile and active lifestyles have created new opportunities for us in the fast-growing market for self-monitored and DIY products and services. Our technology also allows us to service our customers via various connected and wearable devices whether they are at home or on-the-go.\nIn addition, we offer professional monitoring of third-party devices by enabling other companies to integrate solutions into our monitoring and billing platform. This allows us to provide monitoring solutions to customers who do not currently have an installed ADT security system or interactive automation platform.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we serve approximately 7.2 million recurring customers, excluding contracts monitored but not owned. We are one of the largest full-service companies with a national footprint providing both residential and commercial monitored security. We deliver an integrated customer experience by maintaining the industry's largest sales, installation, and service field force, as well as a 24/7 professional monitoring network.\nBASIS OF PRESENTATION\nAll financial information presented in this section has been prepared in U.S. dollars in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) and include the accounts of ADT Inc. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.\nWe report financial and operating information in one segment. Our operating segment is also our reportable segment. We have presented results of operations, including the related discussion and analysis, for the following periods: (i) year ended December 31, 2018 compared to year ended December 31, 2017, and (ii) year ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2016.\nFACTORS AFFECTING OPERATING RESULTS\nOur subscriber-based business requires significant upfront investment to generate new customers, which in turn provides predictable recurring revenue generated from our monitoring and other services. In order to optimize returns on customer acquisitions and cash flow generation, we focus on the following key drivers of our business: best-in-class customer service; increased customer retention; disciplined, high-quality customer additions; efficient customer acquisition; and reduced costs incurred to provide ongoing services to customers.\nOur ability to add new subscribers depends on the overall demand for our products and solutions, which is driven by a number of external factors. The overall economic condition in the geographies in which we operate can impact our ability to attract new customers and grow our business in all customer channels. Growth in our residential customer base can be influenced by the overall state of the housing market. Growth in our commercial customer base can be influenced by the rate at which new businesses begin operations or existing businesses grow. The demand for our products and solutions is also impacted by the perceived threat of crime, as well as the quality of the service of our competitors.\nThe monthly fees that we generate from any individual customer vary based on the level of service we provide to the customer and customer tenure. We offer a wide range of services at various price points from basic burglar alarm monitoring to our full suite of interactive services. Our ability to increase monthly fees at the individual customer level depends on a number of factors, including our ability to effectively introduce and market additional features and services that increase the value of our offerings to customers, which we believe drives customers to purchase higher levels of service and supports our ability to make periodic adjustments to pricing.\nAttrition has a direct impact on the number of customers we monitor and service, as well as our financial results, including revenue, operating income, and cash flows. A portion of our customer base can be expected to cancel its service every year. Customers may choose not to renew or may terminate their contracts for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, relocation, cost, loss to competition, or service issues.\nPublic Company Costs\nAs a result of our IPO, we incur additional legal, accounting, board compensation, and other expenses that we did not previously incur prior to becoming a public company, including costs associated with SEC reporting and corporate governance requirements. These requirements include compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, as well as other rules implemented by the SEC and the national securities exchanges. Our financial statements following our IPO reflect the impact of these expenses.\nRadio Conversion Costs\nWe have received notice from the providers of 3G and CDMA cellular networks that they will be retiring their 3G and CDMA networks by the first quarter of 2022. We currently provide services to approximately 4 million customer sites that use 3G or CDMA cellular equipment, which number is diminishing on a monthly basis in the ordinary course of business due to attrition, upgrades and repairs. Our plans to address this three-year transition are not yet finalized and the impact involves numerous estimates and variables. Among other factors, we will look to reduce any applicable costs to the Company, such as hardware costs currently estimated to be less than $90 per site, by exploring cost sharing opportunities, working with our suppliers, carriers and customers, and to increase revenue by using the transition as an opportunity to sell new products and services in conjunction with replacing the radio and to more rapidly transition customers to our new Command and Control technology.\nSIGNIFICANT EVENTS\nThe following are events that have occurred that significantly impact the comparability of our results of operations in historical or future periods:\nADT Acquisition\nOn May 2, 2016, we completed our acquisition of The ADT Corporation, a leading provider of monitored security and interactive automation solutions in the U.S. and Canada. The ADT Acquisition provided us the ability to continue to expand our market presence in the security industry by leveraging the ADT brand name and other best practices.\nTotal consideration in connection with the ADT Acquisition was $12,114 million, which included the assumption of The ADT Corporation's outstanding debt (inclusive of capital lease obligations) at a fair value of $3,551 million on the acquisition date, and cash of approximately $54 million.\nWe funded the ADT Acquisition, as well as related transaction costs, using the net proceeds from a combination of the following:\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(i)\n</td> <td>equity proceeds of $3,571 million, net of issuance costs, which resulted from equity issuances by us and Ultimate Parent to our Sponsor and certain other investors;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(ii)\n</td> <td>incremental first lien term loan borrowings of $1,555 million and the issuance of $3,140 million of the Prime Notes; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(iii)\n</td> <td>issuance by ADT Inc. of 750,000 shares of the Koch Preferred Securities and issuance by Ultimate Parent of the Warrants to the Koch Investor for an aggregate amount of $750 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInitial Public Offering\nIn January 2018, we completed our IPO in which we issued and sold 105,000,000 shares of common stock at an initial public offering price of $14.00 per share. Net proceeds from the IPO were $1,406 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and offering expenses.\nOn February 21, 2018, we used approximately $649 million of the proceeds from the IPO to redeem $594 million aggregate principal amount of Prime Notes and pay the related call premium.\nOn July 2, 2018, we redeemed the original stated value of $750 million of the Koch Preferred Securities for total consideration of approximately $949 million using proceeds from the IPO and cash on hand. The total consideration paid includes approximately $103 million related to the redemption premium and tax reimbursements, as well as $96 million related to the accumulated dividend obligation on the Koch Preferred Securities. We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $213 million as a result of the redemption. The remaining proceeds from the IPO were used to pay IPO related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018 and in connection with the IPO, we redeemed Class B Units in Ultimate Parent in full for the number of shares of our common stock ( Distributed Shares\u201d) that would have been distributed to such holder under the terms of Ultimate Parent's operating agreement in a hypothetical liquidation on the date of the IPO at the initial public offering price ( Class B Unit Redemption\u201d), which resulted in a modification of both the shares subject to time-based vesting ( Distributed Shares Service Tranche\u201d) and shares subject to vesting based upon the achievement of certain investment return thresholds by Apollo ( Distributed Shares Performance Tranche\u201d). The modification of the Distributed Shares Performance Tranche resulted in a significant increase in fair value, whereas the impact of the modification on the Distributed Shares Service Tranche was not material. Additionally, upon consummation of the IPO, we approved our 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan ( 2018 Plan\u201d). Under the 2018 Plan, and in connection with the Class B Unit Redemption, we also granted options to holders of Class B Units ( Top-up Options\u201d). The Class B Unit Redemption and Top-up Options resulted in the increase in share-based compensation expense during 2018.\nRed Hawk Acquisition\nOn December 3, 2018, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Red Hawk Fire & Security, a leader in commercial fire, life safety, and security services, for total consideration of $318 million and cash paid of $301 million, net of cash acquired ( Red Hawk Acquisition\u201d). We funded the Red Hawk Acquisition from a combination of additional debt financing and cash on hand. This acquisition is intended to accelerate our growth in the commercial security market and expand our product portfolio with the introduction of commercial fire safety related solutions.\nKEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\nIn evaluating our results, we utilize key performance indicators which include non-GAAP measures as well as the operating metrics of gross revenue attrition, unit and customer count, RMR, RMR additions and revenue payback. Our computations of key performance indicators may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Additionally, our operating metric key performance indicators are approximated as there may be variations to reported results in each period due to certain adjustments we might make in connection with the integration over several periods of acquired companies that calculated these metrics differently, or otherwise, including periodic reassessments and refinements in the ordinary course of business. These refinements, for example, may include changes due to systems conversion or historical methodology differences in legacy systems.\nRecurring Monthly Revenue ( RMR\u201d)\nRMR is generated by contractual monthly recurring fees for monitoring and other recurring services provided to our customers, including contracts monitored but not owned. We believe the presentation of RMR is useful because it measures the volume of revenue under contract at a given point in time.\nGross Customer Revenue Attrition\nGross customer revenue attrition is defined as the RMR lost as a result of customer attrition, net of dealer charge-backs and reinstated customers, excluding contracts monitored but not owned. Customer sites are considered canceled when all services are terminated. Dealer charge-backs represent customer cancellations charged back to the dealers because the customer canceled service during the charge-back period, generally twelve to fifteen months.\nGross customer revenue attrition is calculated on a trailing twelve-month basis, the numerator of which is the annualized RMR lost during the period due to attrition, net of dealer charge-backs and reinstated customers, excluding contracts monitored but not owned, and the denominator of which is total annualized RMR based on an average of RMR under contract at the beginning of each month during the period.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that we believe is useful to investors to measure the operational strength and performance of our business. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA, a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) (the most comparable GAAP measure), and additional information, including a description of the limitations relating to the use of Adjusted EBITDA, are provided under -Non-GAAP Measures.\u201d In addition, Adjusted EBITDA may be presented on a supplemental pro forma basis. Refer to the -Supplemental Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d section for further discussion regarding the presentation of supplemental pro forma financial information.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure that our management employs to measure cash that is available to repay debt, make other investments, and pay dividends. Our definition of Free Cash Flow, a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to net cash provided by operating activities (the most comparable GAAP measure), and additional information, including a description of the limitations relating to the use of Free Cash Flow, are provided under -Non-GAAP Measures.\u201d\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations, summary cash flow data, and key performance indicators for the periods presented.\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in contractual monthly recurring fees for monitoring and other recurring services, which resulted from the addition of new customers and improvements in average pricing, partially offset by customer attrition. The improvement in average pricing was driven by the addition of new customers at higher rates, largely due to new subscribers generally selecting higher priced services as compared to our existing customers, as well as price escalations on our existing customer base. These factors also were a primary driver for the increase in RMR to $347 million as of December 31, 2018 from $335 million as of December 31, 2017. In addition, approximately 2% of the 4% increase in RMR was due to the Red Hawk Acquisition. Gross customer revenue attrition improved to 13.3% as of December 31, 2018 from 13.7% as of December 31, 2017 as a result of lower voluntary disconnects and lower disconnects due to non-paying customers.\nInstallation and other revenue increased by $186 million during 2018. This increase was primarily due to $153 million related to revenue from security equipment sold outright to customers, of which approximately $99 million related to incremental revenue associated with acquisitions. The remaining increase of $33 million was due to additional amortization of deferred subscriber acquisition revenue during 2018.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue increased by $146 million during 2018. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to $118 million from installation costs associated with a higher volume of sales where security-related equipment is sold outright to customers, the majority of which is due to the incremental volume associated with acquisitions. The remaining increase is due to an increase in our field and maintenance service expenses, of which approximately $15 million is related to incremental expenses associated with acquisitions.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $38 million during 2018. The increase was related to $124 million associated with our equity compensation awards, which were impacted by the completion of our IPO, $11 million related to compensation arrangements associated with acquisitions, as well as other incremental general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by:\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(i)\n</td> <td>decreases in financing and consent fees of $55 million due to fees of $9 million incurred during 2018 in connection with amendments and restatements to the First Lien Credit Agreement as compared to $64 million of fees incurred during 2017 in connection with the payment of the Special Dividend and amendments and restatements to the First Lien Credit Agreement;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(ii)\n</td> <td>decreases in management consulting agreement fees of $19 million, which was terminated upon consummation of the IPO; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(iii)\n</td> <td>favorable legal settlements of $17.5 million due to two settlements during 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Depreciation and Intangible Asset Amortization\nDepreciation and intangible asset amortization increased by $68 million during 2018. This increase was primarily attributable to $100 million associated with the amortization of customer contracts acquired under the ADT Authorized Dealer Program, partially offset by a decrease in the amortization of trade names of $41 million primarily associated with the Protection One trade name, which became fully amortized in June 2018.\nMerger, Restructuring, Integration, and Other\nMerger, restructuring, integration, and other decreased by $68 million during 2018. This decrease was primarily due to the following: (i) a gain on fair value remeasurement of approximately $11 million on a strategic investment during 2018 compared to impairment charges of approximately $18 million on strategic investments during 2017; (ii) an $18 million decrease in restructuring efforts; and (iii) a $14 million decrease related to integration costs associated with acquisitions.\nGoodwill Impairment\nAs part of our annual goodwill impairment tests during the fourth quarter of 2018, we determined that our goodwill related to the Canada reporting unit was impaired, which was primarily driven by the underperformance of the Canada reporting unit relative to expectations. Accordingly, we recorded a goodwill impairment loss of $88 million. We did not record a goodwill impairment loss in 2017.\nInterest Expense, net\nNet interest expense was primarily comprised of interest expense on our long-term debt and the dividend obligation associated with the Koch Preferred Securities and decreased by $70 million during 2018. The decrease in net interest expense was primarily driven by a reduction in interest expense of $47 million due to the redemption of $594 million aggregate principal amount of the Prime Notes in February 2018 and a reduction in interest expense of approximately $37 million due to the Koch Redemption in July of 2018. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of approximately $24 million due to an increase in interest rates on our variable-rate debt, including the impact of our interest rate swaps. Refer to the -Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section for further discussion regarding our debt and interest.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nLoss on extinguishment of debt in 2018 includes approximately $213 million associated with the Koch Redemption in July 2018, which related to the payment of the redemption premium and tax reimbursements, as well as the write-off of the unamortized discount and deferred financing costs. In addition, loss on extinguishment of debt includes approximately $62 million primarily associated with the partial redemption of the Prime Notes in February 2018, which related to the payment of the call premium, as well as the write-off of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs. Loss on extinguishment of debt in 2017 was not material.\nOther Income (Expense)\nDuring 2018, other income primarily includes $22 million of licensing fees, as well as a gain of $7.5 million from the sale of equity in a third party that we received as part of a settlement.\nDuring 2017, other income primarily includes $24 million of foreign currency gains related to the conversion of intercompany loans that are denominated in Canadian dollars. During the first quarter of 2018, we designated certain of these intercompany loans to be of a long-term-investment nature and began recognizing the related foreign currency gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nIncome tax benefit was $23 million during 2018, resulting in an effective tax rate for the period of 3.7%. The effective tax rate reflects the reduced federal income tax rate of 21% as a result of Tax Reform, a 10.3% unfavorable impact from permanent non-deductible expenses, primarily associated with the Koch Preferred Securities, a 5.8% unfavorable impact from future non-deductible share-based compensation, a 3.7% unfavorable impact from non-deductible goodwill impairment loss, and a 3.2% unfavorable impact from state legislative changes, offset by a 3.8% favorable impact of tax adjustments related to prior year state returns filed in the first quarter of 2018.\nIncome tax benefit was $764 million in 2017, resulting in an effective tax rate for the period of 181.3%. The effective tax rate primarily reflects the favorable impact of Tax Reform offset by the unfavorable impact of permanent tax adjustments.\nTax Reform was signed into law on December 22, 2017. In response to Tax Reform, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d), which allowed companies to record provisional estimates of the effects of the legislative change, and a one-year measurement period to finalize the accounting of those effects. As of December 31, 2018, we completed the accounting for the tax effects of Tax Reform and recorded no material changes to the provisional estimates recorded in 2017.\nThe effective tax rates in 2018 and 2017 reflect the tax impact of permanent tax adjustments, state tax expense, changes in tax laws, and non-U.S. net earnings. The effective tax rate can vary from period to period due to permanent tax adjustments, discrete items such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, recurring factors such as changes in the overall effective state tax rate, as well as fluctuations in pre-tax income or loss. Discrete items and permanent tax adjustments will have a greater impact on the effective tax rate when pre-tax income or loss is lower. Refer to Note 7 Income Taxes\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 for further discussion.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nTotal Revenue\nMonitoring and related services revenue increased by $1,281 million during 2017. This increase was largely attributable to incremental revenue of approximately $1,168 million in 2017 associated with the ADT Acquisition and the amortization of deferred revenue as a result of the application of purchase accounting in connection with the ADT Acquisition that reduced revenue by $63 million during 2016.\nThe remainder of the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in contractual monthly recurring fees for monitoring and other recurring services, which resulted from the addition of new customers and improvements in average pricing, partially offset by customer attrition. The improvement in average pricing was driven by the addition of new customers at higher rates, largely due to new subscribers generally selecting higher priced services as compared to our existing customers, as well as price escalations on our existing customer base. These factors also were the primary driver for an increase in RMR to $335 million as of December 31, 2017 from $328 million as of December 31, 2016. Gross customer revenue attrition improved to 13.7% as of December 31, 2017 from 14.8% as of December 31, 2016 as a result of our enhanced focus on high quality customer additions through our disciplined customer selection process.\nInstallation and other revenue increased by $85 million during 2017. This increase primarily resulted from $49 million related to revenue from security equipment sold outright to customers in 2017, which includes approximately $10 million of incremental revenue associated with the operations of The ADT Corporation. Additionally, the increase in installation and other revenue includes $36 million of revenue related to the amortization of deferred installation revenue, which includes approximately $11 million of incremental deferred installation revenue associated with the operations of The ADT Corporation during 2017.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue increased by $202 million during 2017. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to (i) an increase in field and maintenance service expenses of $89 million primarily associated with the operations of The ADT Corporation, including expenses incurred for service calls for customers who have maintenance contracts, and (ii) an increase in customer care expenses of $75 million primarily attributable to costs associated with the operations of The ADT Corporation, as well as investments associated with enhanced customer revenue attrition improvement initiatives, which was partially offset by reduced software license expenses related to a cloud computing accounting standard adopted in 2016. The remainder of the increase in cost of revenue was due to increased installation costs of approximately $38 million associated with a higher volume of sales where security-related equipment is sold outright to customers.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $350 million during 2017. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to incremental expenses associated with The ADT Corporation business of approximately $324 million. The remainder of the increase, excluding the impact from the incremental expenses associated with The ADT Corporation business, was primarily due to (i) $64 million of financing and consent fees incurred in 2017 and (ii) an increase related to the amortization of deferred subscriber acquisition costs of approximately $25 million. These costs were partially offset by (i) decreases in general and administrative and advertising expenses of $31 million that were primarily the result of synergies associated with the ADT Acquisition and (ii) a decrease in radio conversion costs of $27 million.\nDepreciation and Intangible Asset Amortization\nDepreciation and intangible asset amortization increased by $630 million during 2017. This increase primarily related to depreciation and intangible asset amortization associated with the fair value of assets acquired in the ADT Acquisition, which primarily includes amortization of definite-lived intangible assets and depreciation of subscriber system assets. Additionally, the increase in depreciation and intangible asset amortization was also attributable to (i) an increase in amortization of customer contracts acquired under the ADT Authorized Dealer Program of $104 million, (ii) an increase in amortization of $42 million\nprimarily associated with the Protection One trade name, which we began amortizing in July 2016, and (iii) amortization of software license expenses of $37 million related to the cloud computing accounting standard.\nMerger, Restructuring, Integration, and Other\nMerger, restructuring, integration, and other decreased by $329 million during 2017. This decrease was primarily due to merger costs of $311 million associated with the ADT Acquisition incurred during 2016 and a decrease in restructuring charges of $33 million due to charges incurred in 2016 primarily related to the severance of certain former executives and employees of The ADT Corporation in connection with the ADT Acquisition. These charges were partially offset by an increase in integration expenses primarily associated with the integration of The ADT Corporation business, as well as an increase in impairment charges related to our strategic investments.\nInterest Expense, net\nNet interest expense was primarily comprised of interest expense on our long-term debt and the dividend obligation associated with the Koch Preferred Securities and increased by $211 million during 2017. The increase in interest expense was primarily the result of an increase in borrowings to fund the ADT Acquisition, including the dividend obligation associated with the Koch Preferred Securities. Refer to the -Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section for further discussion regarding our debt and interest.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nLoss on extinguishment of debt was $4 million and $28 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively, and primarily related to the write-off of debt discount and issuance costs associated with amendments and restatements to our First Lien Credit Agreement, as well as the voluntary paydown of $260 million of the second lien term loan, as defined herein, in July and October 2016.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) was primarily attributable to net foreign currency gains of $24 million and losses of $16 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to the conversion of intercompany loans that are denominated in Canadian dollars. Other expense during 2016 also includes a net loss on the settlement of derivative contracts that were executed to hedge future cash flows associated with the ADT Acquisition.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nIncome tax benefit was $764 million during 2017, resulting in an effective tax rate for the period of 181.3%. The effective tax rate for 2017 reflects the favorable impact of Tax Reform offset by the unfavorable impact of permanent tax adjustments.\nTax Reform was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The legislation, among other things, reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, imposed a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, imposed significant limitations on the deductibility of interest, allowed for the full expensing of capital expenditures, and put into effect the migration from a worldwide\u201d system of taxation to a modified territorial system. In response to Tax Reform, SAB 118 allowed companies to record provisional estimates of the effects of the legislative change, and a one-year measurement period to finalize the accounting of those effects. As of December 31, 2017, we had not finalized our analysis of the implications of this legislative change; however, our net deferred tax assets and liabilities were revalued at the newly enacted U.S. corporate rate, and provisional amounts associated with the legislative changes were recognized in our tax benefit in 2017. The total provisional amount recorded as of December 31, 2017 was $690 million and included a remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as the impact of the mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2018, we completed the accounting for the tax effects of Tax Reform and recorded no material changes to the provisional estimates recorded in the 2017 financial statements.\nIncome tax benefit was $266 million during 2016, resulting in an effective tax rate for the period of 33.2%. The effective tax rate for 2016 primarily reflects the impact of permanent tax adjustments mainly related to non-deductible acquisition costs associated with the ADT Acquisition.\nThe effective tax rates for 2017 and 2016 reflect the tax impact of permanent tax adjustments, state tax expense, changes in tax laws, and non-U.S. net earnings. The effective tax rate can vary from period to period due to permanent tax adjustments, discrete items such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, recurring factors such as changes in the overall effective state tax rate, as well as fluctuations in pre-tax income or loss. Discrete items and permanent tax adjustments will have\na greater impact on the effective tax rate when pre-tax income is lower. Refer to Note 7 Income Taxes\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 for further discussion.\nNON-GAAP MEASURES\nTo provide investors with additional information in connection with our results as determined by GAAP, we disclose Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow as non-GAAP measures. These measures are not financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flows, or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain non-cash items and about unusual items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future, as well as other items. Further, we believe Adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful measure of operating profitability because we use it for evaluating our business performance, making budgeting decisions, and comparing our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss adjusted for (i) interest, (ii) taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, including depreciation of subscriber system assets and other fixed assets and amortization of dealer and other intangible assets, (iv) amortization of deferred costs and deferred revenue associated with subscriber acquisitions, (v) share-based compensation expense, (vi) purchase accounting adjustments under GAAP, (vii) merger, restructuring, integration, and other, (viii) goodwill impairment losses, (ix) financing and consent fees, (x) foreign currency gains/losses, (xi) losses on extinguishment of debt, (xii) radio conversion costs, (xiii) management fees and other charges, and (xiv) other non-cash items.\nThere are material limitations to using Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account certain significant items, including depreciation and amortization, interest, taxes, and other adjustments which directly affect our net income or loss. These limitations are best addressed by considering the economic effects of the excluded items independently and by considering Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA may be presented on a supplemental pro forma basis. Refer to the -Supplemental Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d section for further discussion regarding the presentation of supplemental pro forma financial information.\nFree Cash Flow\nWe believe that the presentation of Free Cash Flow is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about our ability to repay debt, make other investments, and pay dividends.\nWe define Free Cash Flow as cash flows from operating activities less cash outlays related to capital expenditures. We define capital expenditures to include purchases of property, plant, and equipment; subscriber system asset additions and deferred subscriber installation costs; and accounts purchased through our network of authorized dealers or third parties outside of our authorized dealer network. These items are subtracted from cash flows from operating activities because they represent long-term investments that are required for normal business activities.\nFree Cash Flow adjusts for cash items that are ultimately within management's discretion to direct, and therefore, may imply that there is less or more cash that is available than the most comparable GAAP measure. Free Cash Flow is not intended to represent residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures since debt repayment requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures are not deducted. These limitations are best addressed by using Free Cash Flow in combination with the cash flows as calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nThe table below reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to net (loss) income for the periods presented.\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(609,155\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>342,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(536,587\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>663,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>732,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>521,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit\n</td> <td>(23,463\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(764,313\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(266,151\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and intangible asset amortization\n</td> <td>1,930,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,863,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,232,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merger, restructuring, integration and other\n</td> <td>(3,344\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>393,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill impairment\n</td> <td>87,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing and consent fees(1)\n</td> <td>8,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency losses / (gains)(2)\n</td> <td>3,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23,804\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>274,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of deferred revenue fair value adjustment(3)\n</td> <td>166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other non-cash items\n</td> <td>1,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Radio conversion costs(4)\n</td> <td>5,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,405\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of deferred subscriber acquisition costs\n</td> <td>59,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of deferred subscriber acquisition revenue\n</td> <td>(79,136\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(46,454\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,717\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>135,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management fees and other charges(5)\n</td> <td>(2,276\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,453,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,352,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,532,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________________\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>In 2017, relates to fees incurred in connection with the Special Dividend and amendments and restatements related to the First Lien Credit Agreement.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Relates to the conversion of intercompany loans that are denominated in Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Represents adjustments related to the fair value of deferred revenue under GAAP, primarily related to the ADT Acquisition in 2016 and the Red Hawk Acquisition in 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(4)\n</td> <td>Represents costs associated with upgrading cellular technology used in many of our security systems.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(5)\n</td> <td>In 2018, primarily includes income of approximately $22 million of one-time licensing fees, as well as a gain of $7.5 million from the sale of equity in a third party that we received as part of a settlement during the second quarter of 2018 partially offset by $14 million in compensation arrangements related to acquisitions.

This increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue from contractual monthly recurring fees for monitoring and other recurring services, as well as higher revenue on transactions in which security equipment is sold outright to customers partially offset by the associated costs. The remainder of this increase was attributable to a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding items outside of our definition of Adjusted EBITDA.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nDuring 2017, Adjusted EBITDA increased by $820 million. This increase was primarily due to incremental revenue net of incremental costs associated with The ADT Corporation business. The remainder of this increase was attributable to revenue growth, excluding the impact of purchase accounting, and a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding items outside of our definition of Adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by increase in cost of revenue.\nRefer to the discussions above under -Results of Operations\u201d for further details.\nFree Cash Flow\nThe table below reconciles Free Cash Flow to cash flows from operating activities for the periods presented.\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,787,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,591,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>617,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dealer generated customer accounts and bulk account purchases\n</td> <td>(693,525\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(653,222\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(407,102\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscriber system assets and deferred subscriber installation costs\n</td> <td>(576,290\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(582,723\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(468,594\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures\n</td> <td>(126,799\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(130,624\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(78,499\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free Cash Flow\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>390,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>225,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(336,672\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nRefer to the discussion below under -Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for further details regarding cash flows from operating activities.\nCash Outlays Related to Capital Expenditures\nDealer generated customer accounts and bulk account purchases, subscriber system assets and deferred subscriber installation costs, and capital expenditures are included in cash flows from investing activities. Refer to the discussion below under -Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for further details regarding cash flows from investing activities.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity\nOur principal liquidity requirements are to finance current operations, investments in internally generated subscriber system assets and dealer generated customer accounts, expenditures for property and equipment, debt service requirements, and potential mergers and acquisitions. Our liquidity requirements are primarily funded by our cash flows from operations, which include cash received from monthly recurring revenue and upfront fees received from customers, less cash costs to provide services to our customers, including general and administrative costs, certain costs associated with acquiring new customers, and interest payments.\nWe expect our ongoing sources of liquidity to include cash generated from operations, as well as borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the issuance of equity and/or debt securities as appropriate given market conditions. Our future cash needs are expected to include cash for operating activities, working capital, capital expenditures, strategic investments, periodic principal and interest payments on our debt, and potential dividend payments to our stockholders. We may, from time to time, seek to repay, redeem, repurchase, or refinance our indebtedness, or seek to retire or purchase our outstanding securities through cash purchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions or through a 10b5-1 repurchase plan or otherwise, and any such transactions may involve material amounts. We believe our cash position, borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facilities, and cash provided by operating activities are, and will continue to be, adequate to meet our operational and business needs in the next twelve months as well as our long-term liquidity needs.\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations and other capital requirements, including capital expenditures, as well as make acquisitions, will depend on our future operating performance, which is subject to future general economic, financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other conditions, many of which are beyond our control. See -Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business.\u201d Changes in our operating plans, material changes in anticipated sales, increased expenses, acquisitions, or other events may cause us to seek equity and/or debt financing in future periods. There can be no guarantee that financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Debt financing, if available, could impose additional cash payment obligations and subject us to additional covenants and operating restrictions.\nWe are a highly leveraged company with significant debt service requirements. As of December 31, 2018, we had $363 million in cash and cash equivalents and $350 million available under our revolving credit facility. The carrying value of total debt outstanding was $10,002 million as of December 31, 2018. On February 15, 2019, we entered into an additional first lien revolving credit agreement with an aggregate available commitment of up to $50 million maturing on March 16, 2023.\nInitial Public Offering\nIn January 2018, in connection with the consummation of our IPO, we received net proceeds of $1,406 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and offering expenses.\nOn February 21, 2018, we used approximately $649 million of the proceeds from the IPO to redeem $594 million aggregate principal amount of the Prime Notes and pay the related call premium.\nOn July 2, 2018, we redeemed the original stated value of $750 million of the Koch Preferred Securities for total consideration of approximately $949 million using proceeds from the IPO and cash on hand. The total consideration paid includes approximately $103 million related to the redemption premium and tax reimbursements, as well as $96 million related to the accumulated dividend obligation on the Koch Preferred Securities. We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $213 million as a result of the redemption.

In addition, we are required to make annual prepayments on the outstanding First Lien Term B-1 Loan with a percentage of our excess cash flow, as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement, if our excess cash flow exceeds a certain specified threshold. We are not currently required to make any annual prepayments based on our excess cash flow. We may make voluntarily prepayments on the First Lien Term B-1 Loan at any time prior to maturity at par. The First Lien Term B-1 Loan has a variable interest\nrate calculated as, at our option, either (a) LIBOR determined by reference to the costs of funds for Eurodollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing, adjusted for certain additional costs ( Adjusted LIBOR\u201d) with a floor of 1.00%, or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% per annum, (ii) the prime rate published by The Wall Street Journal, and (iii) one-month adjusted LIBOR plus 1.00% per annum ( Base Rate\u201d), in each case, plus the applicable margin of 2.75% for Adjusted LIBOR loans and 1.75% for Base Rate loans.

Following the partial redemption, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Prime Notes was $2,246 million.\nADT Notes\nIn connection with the ADT Acquisition, we entered into supplemental indentures to notes originally issued by The ADT Corporation (collectively, the ADT Notes\u201d) providing for each series of ADT Notes to benefit from (i) guarantees by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries and (ii) first-priority senior security interests, subject to permitted liens, in substantially all of the existing and future assets of our domestic subsidiaries. As a result, these notes remained outstanding and became obligations of ours.\nIn connection with the ADT Acquisition, $718 million aggregate principal amount of the existing ADT Notes due 2042 were exchanged for new ADT Notes due 2032. In August 2016, an additional $10 million of the ADT Notes due 2042 were exchanged for ADT Notes due 2032 pursuant to a second supplemental indenture and constitute part of the same series of notes as the $718 million of the ADT Notes due 2032.\nWe may redeem the ADT Notes, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus a make-whole premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest as of, but excluding, the redemption date.\nDebt Covenants\nThe First Lien Credit Agreement and indentures associated with the borrowings above contain certain covenants and restrictions that limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt or issue certain preferred equity interests; create liens on certain assets; make certain loans or investments (including acquisitions); pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of the capital stock or make other restricted payments; consolidate, merge, sell, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; sell assets; enter into certain transactions with affiliates; enter into sale-leaseback transactions; restrict dividends from our subsidiaries or restrict liens; change our fiscal year; and modify the terms of certain debt or organizational agreements.\nWe are also subject to a springing financial maintenance covenant under the First Lien Credit Agreement, which requires us to not exceed a specified first lien leverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter if the testing conditions are satisfied. The covenant is tested if the outstanding loans under the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility, subject to certain exceptions, exceed 30% of the total commitments under the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility at the testing date (i.e., the last day of any fiscal quarter).\nAdditionally, upon the occurrence of specified change of control events, we must offer to purchase the Prime Notes and ADT Notes at 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the purchase date.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all financial covenant and other maintenance tests for all our debt obligations.\nDividends\nOur board of directors declared the following cash dividends on our common stock in 2018:\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Declared Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dividend per Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Record Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payment Date\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 15, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 26, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 5, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>May 9, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 25, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 10, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>August 8, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 18, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 2, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>November 7, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 14, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 4, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2018, we declared dividends of $107 million (or $0.14 per share), of which $79 million was paid.

There were no dividends declared or paid in 2016.\nEffective March 11, 2019, we declared a cash dividend on our common stock of $0.035 per share payable to common stockholders of record on April 2, 2019. This dividend will be paid on April 12, 2019.\nDividend Reinvestment Plan and Share Repurchase Program\nOn February 27, 2019, we approved a dividend reinvestment plan ( DRIP\u201d) which will allow stockholders to designate all or a portion of the cash dividends on their shares of common stock for reinvestment in additional shares of our common stock. In addition, on February 27, 2019 we approved a share repurchase program which will permit us to repurchase up to $150 million of our shares of common stock through February 27, 2021. We may effect these repurchases pursuant to one or more trading plans to be adopted in accordance with Securities Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1, in privately negotiated transactions, in open market transactions or pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase program. We intend to conduct the share repurchase program in accordance with Securities Exchange Act Rule 10b-18. We are not obligated to repurchase any of our shares of common stock and the timing and amount of any repurchases will depend on legal requirements, market conditions, stock price, alternative uses of capital, and other factors.\nCash Flow Analysis\nThe following table is a summary of our cash flow activity for the periods presented:\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,787,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,591,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>617,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,738,210\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,413,310\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,411,714\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>193,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(143,069\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,828,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nDuring 2018, cash flows provided by operating activities increased by approximately $196 million compared to 2017 due to the following: (i) an increase in revenue from contractual monthly recurring fees for monitoring and other recurring services; (ii) an increase in revenue from transactions in which security equipment is sold outright to customers partially offset by the associated costs; (iii) a decrease in cash paid related to acquisition, integration, and restructuring costs associated with the ADT Acquisition; and (iv) a decrease in cash paid of $55 million for fees associated with the Special Dividend and fees in connection with amendments and restatements to the First Lien Credit Agreement. These increases in cash flows provided by operating activities were partially offset by a net increase in cash interest paid of $27 million due to the Koch Redemption and higher interest rates on variable-rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, partially offset by a decrease in cash interest paid due to the partial redemption of the Prime Notes in 2018. The remainder of the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities relates to changes in assets and liabilities due to the volume and timing of other operating cash receipts and payments with respect to when the transactions are reflected in earnings.\nDuring 2017, cash flows provided by operating activities increased by approximately $974 million compared to 2016 based on the activity described below.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for 2017 resulted from $1,550 million of net income, exclusive of depreciation and intangible assets amortization and other non-cash items, and reflects: (i) cash interest paid of $661 million, (ii) cash paid of $64 million for fees associated with the Special Dividend and fees in connection with amendments and restatements to the First Lien Credit Agreement, (iii) restructuring payments of $25 million and integration payments of $21 million primarily associated with the ADT Acquisition, (iv) cash paid for fees under the Management Consulting Agreement of $20 million, (v) cash paid for radio conversion costs of $13 million, and (vi) other cash payments of $10 million. The remainder relates to changes in assets and liabilities due to the volume and timing of other operating cash receipts and payments.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for 2016 resulted from $620 million of net income, exclusive of depreciation and intangible assets amortization and other non-cash items, and reflects: (i) cash interest paid of $431 million, (ii) transaction costs of $347 million associated with the ADT Acquisition, (iii) cash paid of $29 million for fees in connection with amendments and restatements to the First Lien Credit Agreement, (iv) cash paid for radio conversion costs of $43 million, (v) restructuring payments of $52 million primarily associated with the ADT Acquisition, (iv) other cash payments of $28 million that are primarily related to integration costs of $13 million, management consulting fees of $13 million, and $2 million of other items. The remainder relates to changes in assets and liabilities due to the volume and timing of other operating cash receipts and payments.\nRefer to the discussions above under -Results of Operations\u201d for further details.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nWe make certain investments in our business that are intended to grow our customer base, enhance the overall customer experience, improve the productivity of our field workforce, and support greater efficiency of our back-office systems and our customer care centers.\nDuring 2018, cash flows used in investing activities increased by approximately $325 million compared to 2017 due to the following: (i) an increase in cash used for business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $289 million primarily due to the Red Hawk Acquisition in 2018; and (ii) an increase in dealer generated customer accounts and bulk account purchases of $40 million due to an increase in volume purchased and average cost.\nDuring 2017, cash flows used in investing activities decreased by approximately $7,998 million compared to 2016 due to the following: (i) a decrease in cash used for business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $8,438 million due to the ADT Acquisition in 2016; (ii) an increase in dealer generated customer accounts and bulk account purchases of $246 million; (iii) an increase in subscriber system asset additions of $114 million; and (iv) an increase in capital expenditures of $52 million. The\nincrease in dealer generated customer accounts and bulk account purchases, subscriber system asset additions, and capital expenditures is due to incremental volume as a result of the timing of the ADT Acquisition in 2016. Additionally, we received net proceeds of $42 million from the termination of derivative financial instruments related to the ADT Acquisition during 2016.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nDuring 2018, net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to net proceeds from the IPO of $1,406 million, after deducting related fees, offset by net repayments on our long-term borrowings of $1,130 million and dividend payments on our common stock of $79 million. The net repayments on our long-term borrowings include the redemption of the Koch Preferred Securities of $853 million and the repayment of long-term borrowings of $700 million primarily due to the partial redemption of the Prime Notes, offset by net proceeds of $423 million from additional long-term borrowings.\nDuring 2017, net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to dividend payments of $750 million, offset by net proceeds from long-term borrowings of $619 million. The net proceeds from long-term borrowings includes $800 million from additional long-term borrowings, partially offset by repayments of $140 million under our revolving credit facility, principal paydowns of $27 million, and capital lease payments of $14 million.\nDuring 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to proceeds from borrowings and equity capital contributions, as well as proceeds from the issuance of the Koch Preferred Securities, to fund the ADT Acquisition. The proceeds, as well as repayments of long-term borrowings, were primarily attributable to the amendments and restatements to the First Lien Credit Agreement. Additionally, repayments of long-term borrowings include $260 million of voluntary prepayments of the outstanding principal balance of a second lien term loan, as well as a $22 million paydown of the outstanding balance on a revolving credit facility. We also incurred approximately $104 million in deferred financing costs associated with the long-term borrowings and the issuance of the Koch Preferred Securities and paid $35 million primarily associated with escrow payments to former ASG and Protection One shareholders.\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe following table provides a summary of our commitments and contractual obligations for debt, leases, and other purchase obligations as of December 31, 2018.\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt principal(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>339,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,039,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,804,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,246,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>750,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,220,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments(2)\n</td> <td>622,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>621,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>613,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>409,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>160,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>339,698\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,766,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases(3)\n</td> <td>40,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital leases(4)\n</td> <td>20,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>696\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations(5)\n</td> <td>64,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>787,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,020,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,694,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,243,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,425,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,108,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,280,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Represents the contractual principal payments of our debt obligations as of December 31, 2018, and excludes capital lease obligations, discounts, deferred financing costs, and purchase accounting fair value adjustments.

We do not have any other material off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to select accounting policies and make estimates that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. Management's estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or market conditions. The following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties.\nRevenue Recognition\nASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and related amendments, establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. We adopted this new standard and its related amendments effective on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method, whereby the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard is recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of stockholders' equity. Results for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 are presented under this new standard, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for the prior period.\nThe largest impact from the new standard relates to the timing of recognition of certain incremental selling costs associated with acquiring new customers. Under the new standard, certain costs previously amortized over the initial contract term will now be amortized in pools based on the expected life of a customer relationship using an accelerated method over 15 years. To a lesser extent, the adoption of the new standard impacted the identification of performance obligations and the allocation of transaction price to those performance obligations for certain sales of security systems sold outright to customers.\nAs of January 1, 2018, due to the cumulative impact of adopting this new standard, we recorded a net increase to the opening balance of stockholders' equity of $34 million, which is net of tax of $12 million.\nWe generate revenue primarily through contractual monthly recurring fees received for monitoring and related services provided to customers. In transactions in which we provide monitoring and related services but retain ownership of the security systems, our performance obligations primarily include monitoring, related services (such as maintenance agreements), and a material right associated with the non-refundable fees received in connection with the initiation of a monitoring contract (referred to as deferred subscriber acquisition revenue) that the customer will not need to pay upon a renewal of the contract. The portion of the transaction price associated with monitoring and related services revenue is recognized as those services are provided and is reflected in monitoring and related services revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nDeferred subscriber acquisition revenue is deferred and reported as deferred subscriber acquisition revenue in the Consolidated Balance Sheets upon initiation of a monitoring contract. Deferred subscriber acquisition revenue is amortized in pools into installation and other revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the estimated life of the customer relationship using an accelerated method consistent with the amortization of subscriber system assets and deferred subscriber acquisition costs associated with the transaction.\nIn transactions involving security systems that are sold outright to the customer, our performance obligations generally include monitoring, related services, and the sale and installation of the security systems. For such arrangements, we allocate a portion of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price. Revenue associated with the sale and installation of security systems is recognized once installation is complete and is reflected in installation and other revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Revenue associated with monitoring and related services is recognized as those services are provided and is reflected in monitoring and related services revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nEarly termination of the contract by the customer results in a termination charge in accordance with the contract terms. Contract termination charges are recognized in monitoring and related services revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations when collectability is probable. Amounts collected from customers for sales and other taxes are reported net of the related amounts remitted.\nCustomer billings for services not yet rendered are deferred and recognized as revenue as services are provided. These fees are recorded as current deferred revenue in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as we expect to satisfy any remaining performance obligations, as well as recognize the related revenue, within the next twelve months. Accordingly, we have applied the practical expedient regarding deferred revenue to exclude the value of remaining performance obligations if (i) the contract has an original expected term of one year or less or (ii) we recognize revenue in proportion to the amount it has the right to invoice for services performed.\nSubscriber System Assets, net and Deferred Subscriber Acquisition Costs, net\nWe capitalize certain costs associated with transactions in which we retain ownership of the security system as well as incremental selling expenses related to acquiring customers. These costs include equipment, installation costs, and other incremental costs. Subscriber system assets represent capitalized equipment and installation costs incurred in connection with transactions in which we retain ownership of the security system. Upon customer termination, we may retrieve such assets. These assets have a probable future economic benefit for us as they contribute to the generation of future monitoring and related services revenue for us. Deferred subscriber acquisition costs, net represent incremental selling expenses (primarily commissions) related to acquiring customers.\nSubscriber system assets and any related deferred subscriber acquisition costs resulting from customer acquisitions are accounted for using pools based on the month and year of acquisition. We amortize our pooled subscriber system assets and related deferred subscriber acquisition costs using an accelerated method over the estimated life of the customer relationship, which is 15 years. We periodically perform lifing studies to estimate the expected life of the customer relationship and the attrition pattern of our customers. The lifing studies are based on historical customer terminations and are used to establish the amortization rates of our customer account pools in order to reflect the pattern of future benefit. The results of the lifing studies indicate that we can expect attrition to be the greatest in the initial years of asset life; therefore, an accelerated method best matches the future amortization cost with the estimated revenue stream from these customer pools. In order to align the amortization of subscriber system assets and related deferred costs to the pattern in which their economic benefits are consumed, the accelerated method utilizes an average declining balance rate of approximately 250% and converts to straight-line methodology when the resulting amortization charge is greater than that from the accelerated method, resulting in an average amortization of approximately 55% of the pool within the first five years, 25% within the second five years, and 20% within the final five years.\nDefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nDefinite-lived intangible assets primarily include contracts and related customer and dealer relationships that originated from the Formation Transactions and the ADT Acquisition as well as contracts with customers purchased under the ADT Authorized Dealer Program, or from other third parties.\nThe amortizable life and method of amortization of our contracts and related customer relationships acquired as part of the Formation Transactions and the ADT Acquisition are based on management estimates about the amounts and timing of expected future revenue from customer accounts and average customer account life as of the Formation Transactions and the ADT Acquisition. The amortizable life and method of amortization of our dealer relationships are based on management estimates about the longevity of the underlying dealer network and the attrition of those respective dealers that existed as of the Formation Transactions and the ADT Acquisition. Contracts and related customer relationships acquired as part of the Red Hawk Acquisition are amortized over a period of 10 to 15 years on a straight-line basis. Other definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over a period of up to 10 years on a straight-line basis.\nWe maintain agreements with a network of third-party independent alarm dealers who sell alarm equipment and ADT Authorized Dealer-branded monitoring and interactive services to end users. The dealers in this program generate new end-user contracts with customers which we have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase from the dealer. Purchases of contracts with customers under the ADT Authorized Dealer Program, or from other third parties, are considered asset acquisitions and are recorded at their contractually determined purchase price. We may charge back the purchase price of any end-user contract if the contract is canceled during the charge-back period, which is generally twelve to fifteen months from the date of purchase. We record the amount of the charge back as a reduction to the purchase price.\nPurchases of contracts with customers under the ADT Authorized Dealer Program, or from other third parties, are accounted for using pools based on the month and year of acquisition. We amortize our pooled contracts with customers using an accelerated method over the estimated life of the customer relationship, which is 15 years. The accelerated method for amortizing these\ncontracts utilizes an average declining balance rate of approximately 300% and converts to straight-line methodology when the resulting amortization charge is greater than that from the accelerated method, resulting in an average amortization of approximately 65% of the pool within the first five years, 25% within the second five years, and 10% within the final five years.\nLong-Lived Asset Impairments\nWe review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be fully recoverable. We group assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identified. Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying value of the asset group to its expected future undiscounted cash flows. If the expected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value, less the cost to sell, of the asset group. The calculation of the fair value, less cost to sell, of an asset group is based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized and are tested for impairment at least annually as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and more often if an event occurs or circumstances change which indicate it is more-likely-than-not that fair value is less than carrying amount. The annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets may be completed through qualitative assessments. We may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to a quantitative impairment test for any reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period. We may resume the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset in any subsequent period.\nGoodwill\nUnder a qualitative approach, the impairment test for goodwill consists of an assessment of whether it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit, or if a qualitative assessment indicates it is more-likely-than-not that the estimated carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we proceed to a quantitative approach.\nUnder a quantitative approach, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The fair value of a reporting unit is determined using the income approach which discounts projected cash flows using market participant assumptions. The discounted cash flow methodology includes significant assumptions including, but not limited to, forecasted revenue, operating profit margins, operating expenses, cash flows, perpetual growth rates, and long-term discount rates. The resulting fair value under a quantitative approach is sensitive to changes in the underlying assumptions. In developing these assumptions, we rely on various factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and other market data. Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying judgments and factors and ultimately impact the estimated fair value determinations may include such items as a prolonged downturn in the business environment, changes in economic conditions that significantly differ from our assumptions in timing or degree, volatility in equity and debt markets resulting in higher discount rates, and unexpected regulatory changes. As a result, there are inherent uncertainties related to these judgments and factors in applying them to the goodwill impairment test.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we have approximately $200 million of goodwill allocated to our Canada reporting unit, which reflects a goodwill impairment loss of $88 million recorded due to its underperformance in 2018. During the fourth quarter there were changes to the Canadian leadership team and also revisions to our outlook for the reporting unit completed as part of our annual budgeting process. As a result of the goodwill impairment loss, the carrying value of the Canada reporting unit approximates its fair value, and as such, is considered at risk of future impairment. If our assumptions are not realized, or if there are changes in any of the assumptions in the future due to a change in economic conditions, it is possible that an impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future. Our other reporting units are not considered at risk due to the excess of their fair values over their carrying values. Refer to Note 4 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 for further discussion.\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nUnder a qualitative approach, the impairment review for an indefinite-lived intangible asset consists of an assessment of whether it is more-likely-than-not that an asset's fair value is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset, or if a qualitative assessment indicates it is more-likely-than-not that the estimated carrying value of such asset exceeds its fair value, we proceed to a quantitative approach.\nUnder a quantitative approach, we estimate the fair value of the asset and compare it to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is determined based on the nature of the underlying asset. Our only indefinite-lived intangible asset is the ADT trade name. The fair value of the ADT trade name is determined under a relief from royalty method, which is an income approach that estimates the cost savings that accrue to us that we would otherwise have to pay in the form of royalties or license fees on revenue earned through the use of the asset. The utilization of the relief from royalty method requires us to make significant assumptions including revenue growth rates, the implied royalty rate, and the discount rate.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business acquisitions are recorded at the date of acquisition at their estimated fair values, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and in assigning their respective useful lives. Accordingly, we may engage third-party valuation specialists to assist in these determinations. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe record accruals for losses that we believe are probable to occur and are reasonably estimable. These accruals are based on judgment, the probability of losses, and where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates. Legal costs in connection with claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business are expensed as incurred. Additionally, we record insurance recovery receivables from third-party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable.\nIncome Taxes\nOur federal income tax accounts are determined on a consolidated return basis for U.S. entities and on a standalone basis for Canadian entities.\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. In determining taxable income for our consolidated financial statements, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. We record the effect of a tax rate or law change on our deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period of enactment. Future tax rate or law changes could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years, and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions, including the amount of future pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage its underlying businesses.\nWe recognize positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return in the financial statements when it is more likely than-not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50%) that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. A recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit with greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We record liabilities for positions that have been taken but do not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold. We adjust the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a change to the estimated income taxes.\nTax Reform was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The legislation, among other things, reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, imposed a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, imposed significant limitations on the deductibility of interest, allowed for the full expensing of capital expenditures, and put into effect the migration from a worldwide\u201d system of taxation to a modified territorial system. In response to Tax Reform, the SEC issued SAB 118 that allowed companies to record provisional estimates of the effects of the legislative change, and a one-year measurement period to finalize the accounting of those effects. The total provisional amount recorded in 2017 was $690 million and included a remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as the impact of the mandatory one-time tax on\naccumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2018, we have completed the accounting for the tax effects of this legislative change, and recorded no material changes to the provisional estimates recorded in 2017.\nACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRefer to Note 1 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 for further discussion about recent accounting pronouncements.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nWe believe this section provides additional information to investors about our financial performance in a manner consistent with how management views our performance.

This increase was a result of an increase in monitoring and related services of $75 million and an increase in installation and other revenue of $74 million.\nThe increase in monitoring and related services was primarily attributable to an increase in contractual monthly recurring fees for monitoring and other recurring services, which resulted from the addition of new customers and improvements in average pricing, partially offset by customer attrition. The improvement in average pricing was driven by the addition of new customers at higher rates, largely due to new subscribers generally selecting higher priced services as compared to our existing customers, as well as price escalations on our existing customer base. These factors also were the primary driver for an increase in RMR to $335 million as of December 31, 2017 from $328 million as of December 31, 2016. Gross customer revenue attrition improved to 13.7% as of December 31, 2017 from 14.8% as of December 31, 2016 as a result of our enhanced focus on high quality customer additions through our disciplined customer selection process.\nThe increase in installation and other revenue was due to (i) approximately $38 million related to revenue from security equipment sold outright to customers and (ii) approximately $36 million of additional revenue generated from new customer additions associated with the amortization of deferred installation revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the supplemental pro forma year ended December 31, 2016.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue increased $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the supplemental pro forma year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cost of revenue was attributable to increased costs of approximately $25 million related to installation costs associated with a higher volume of sales where security-related equipment is sold outright to customers and approximately $23 million in field and maintenance service expenses incurred to enhance service levels and lower customer backlog. These were partially offset by decreased customer care expenses of approximately $22 million, which consisted of reduced software license expenses related to a newly adopted cloud computing accounting standard, partially offset by investments in customer care associated with enhanced customer revenue attrition improvement initiatives.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the supplemental pro forma year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease primarily relates to decreases in radio conversion costs of $56 million related to a program that began in 2015 to upgrade cellular technology used in many of our security systems and decreases related to reductions in costs as a result of the integration of The ADT Corporation business, including (i) general and administrative expenses of approximately $37 million, (ii) advertising costs of approximately $33 million, and (iii) selling and marketing costs of approximately $27 million.\nThese decreases were partially offset by costs of approximately $64 million of financing and consent fees incurred in 2017 and increased costs of approximately $35 million related to the amortization of deferred subscriber acquisition costs associated with direct and incremental costs incurred to acquire new customers. The remainder of the increases were primarily due to non-cash asset write-downs related to our strategic investments.\nDepreciation and Intangible Asset Amortization\nDepreciation and intangible asset amortization increased $289 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the supplemental pro forma year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to (i) higher depreciation expense of approximately $111 million related to subscriber system assets, which included costs associated with new customer additions and upgrades; (ii) increased amortization of approximately $104 million related to new customer contracts acquired as a result of the ADT Authorized Dealer Program; and (iii) increased amortization expense of $42 million primarily associated with the Protection One trade name, which we began amortizing in July 2016. The remainder of the increase was primarily due to increased software license expenses related to a newly adopted cloud computing standard mentioned above.\nMerger, Restructuring, Integration, and Other\nMerger, restructuring, integration, and other decreased $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the supplemental pro forma year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in merger, restructuring, integration, and other was primarily related to a decrease in restructuring charges of $35 million primarily related to the severance of certain former executives and employees of The ADT Corporation in connection with the ADT Acquisition included in the supplemental pro forma year ended December 31, 2016, which did not recur in 2017. These charges were partially offset by an increase in integration costs, as well as impairment charges primarily related to our strategic investments.\nInterest Expense, net\nNet interest expense decreased $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the supplemental pro forma year ended December 31, 2016. Net interest expense is primarily comprised of interest expense on our long-term debt. The decrease in interest expense is primarily related to the voluntary paydown of $260 million of a second lien term loan in July and October 2016.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nLoss on extinguishment of debt was $4 million and $28 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 and the supplemental pro forma year ended December 31, 2016, respectively, and related to amendments and restatements to the First Lien Credit Agreement in 2017, and the write-off of debt discount and issuance costs associated with the voluntary paydown of $260 million of a second lien term loans in July and October 2016 and the amendments and restatements to the First Lien Credit Agreement in 2016.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) is attributable to net foreign currency gains of $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and losses of $16 million for the supplemental pro forma year ended December 31, 2016 related to the conversion of intercompany loans that are denominated in Canadian dollars.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nIncome tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $764 million as compared to $119 million for the supplemental pro forma year ended December 31, 2016, resulting in an effective tax rate of 181.3% as compared to an effective tax rate of 29.4% for the respective periods.

The legislation, among other things, reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, imposed a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, imposed significant limitations on the deductibility of interest, allowed for the full expensing of capital expenditures, and put into effect the migration from a worldwide\u201d system of taxation to a modified territorial system. In response to Tax Reform, SAB 118 allowed companies to record provisional estimates of the effects of the legislative change, and a one-year measurement period to finalize the accounting of those effects. As of December 31, 2017, we had not finalized our analysis of the implications of this legislative change; however, our net deferred tax assets and liabilities were revalued at the newly enacted U.S. corporate rate, and provisional amounts associated with the legislative changes were recognized in our tax benefit in 2017.

These charges were partially offset by an increase in integration costs, as well as impairment charges primarily related to our strategic investments.\nWe account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business acquisitions are recorded at the date of acquisition at their estimated fair values, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and in assigning their respective useful lives. Accordingly, we may engage third-party valuation specialists to assist in these determinations. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain.\nFree Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure that our management employs to measure cash that is available to repay debt, make other investments, and pay dividends. Our definition of Free Cash Flow, a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to net cash provided by operating activities (the most comparable GAAP measure), and additional information, including a description of the limitations relating to the use of Free Cash Flow, are provided under -Non-GAAP Measures.\u201d\n\nWe report financial and operating information in one segment. Our operating segment is also our reportable segment. We have presented results of operations, including the related discussion and analysis, for the following periods: (i) year ended December 31, 2018 compared to year ended December 31, 2017, and (ii) year ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2016.\nDuring 2018, net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to net proceeds from the IPO of $1,406 million, after deducting related fees, offset by net repayments on our long-term borrowings of $1,130 million and dividend payments on our common stock of $79 million. The net repayments on our long-term borrowings include the redemption of the Koch Preferred Securities of $853 million and the repayment of long-term borrowings of $700 million primarily due to the partial redemption of the Prime Notes, offset by net proceeds of $423 million from additional long-term borrowings.\n \u25e6 July 1, 2015 - $1,095 million of borrowings in connection with the Formation Transactions; \nACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n (3) Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP measures. Refer to the -Non-GAAP Measures\u201d section for the definitions of these terms and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures. \n (5) Represents contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services, including purchase orders, related to agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction as of December 31, 2018. Refer to Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 for further discussion.  We have not included in the contractual obligations table approximately $80 million of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, relating to various tax positions we have taken. These liabilities may increase or decrease over time primarily as a result of tax examinations, and given the status of the examinations, we cannot reliably estimate the period of any cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Refer to Note 7 Income Taxes\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 for further discussion. In addition, we have not included the minimum required contributions to our defined benefit\nLoss Contingencies\nOther Income (Expense)\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nOn February 21, 2018, we used approximately $649 million of the proceeds from the IPO to redeem $594 million aggregate principal amount of the Prime Notes and pay the related call premium.\nInstallation and other revenue increased by $85 million during 2017. This increase primarily resulted from $49 million related to revenue from security equipment sold outright to customers in 2017, which includes approximately $10 million of incremental revenue associated with the operations of The ADT Corporation. Additionally, the increase in installation and other revenue includes $36 million of revenue related to the amortization of deferred installation revenue, which includes approximately $11 million of incremental deferred installation revenue associated with the operations of The ADT Corporation during 2017.\nplans as the aggregate contributions are not material. Refer to Note 11 Retirements Plans\u201d in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 for further discussion.\nMerger, restructuring, integration, and other decreased by $329 million during 2017. This decrease was primarily due to merger costs of $311 million associated with the ADT Acquisition incurred during 2016 and a decrease in restructuring charges of $33 million due to charges incurred in 2016 primarily related to the severance of certain former executives and employees of The ADT Corporation in connection with the ADT Acquisition. These charges were partially offset by an increase in integration expenses primarily associated with the integration of The ADT Corporation business, as well as an increase in impairment charges related to our strategic investments.\nDuring 2018, we declared dividends of $107 million (or $0.14 per share), of which $79 million was paid. During 2017, we declared and paid $750 million (or $1.17 per share) related to the Special Dividend. There were no dividends declared or paid in 2016.\nDuring 2017, net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to dividend payments of $750 million, offset by net proceeds from long-term borrowings of $619 million. The net proceeds from long-term borrowings includes $800 million from additional long-term borrowings, partially offset by repayments of $140 million under our revolving credit facility, principal paydowns of $27 million, and capital lease payments of $14 million.\nAs of January 1, 2018, due to the cumulative impact of adopting this new standard, we recorded a net increase to the opening balance of stockholders' equity of $34 million, which is net of tax of $12 million.\nAdditionally, we have presented notes to our unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information that describe the supplemental pro forma adjustments and their underlying assumptions. The unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information set forth below is based upon available information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable. The historical financial information has been adjusted to give effect to supplemental pro forma events that are: (1) directly attributable to the ADT Acquisition and the Formation Transactions; (2) factually supportable; and (3) with respect to the statements of operations, expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results. The unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information is for illustrative and informational purposes only and is not intended to represent or be indicative of our financial condition or results of operations had the above transactions occurred on the date indicated. The unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information also should not be considered representative of our future financial condition or results of operations.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Supplemental Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to net loss for the supplemental pro forma year ended December 31, 2016.\n 1(b) Reflects the impact of: \nLiquidity\nCustomer billings for services not yet rendered are deferred and recognized as revenue as services are provided. These fees are recorded as current deferred revenue in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as we expect to satisfy any remaining performance obligations, as well as recognize the related revenue, within the next twelve months. Accordingly, we have applied the practical expedient regarding deferred revenue to exclude the value of remaining performance obligations if (i) the contract has an original expected term of one year or less or (ii) we recognize revenue in proportion to the amount it has the right to invoice for services performed.\nMerger, restructuring, integration, and other decreased by $68 million during 2018. This decrease was primarily due to the following: (i) a gain on fair value remeasurement of approximately $11 million on a strategic investment during 2018 compared to impairment charges of approximately $18 million on strategic investments during 2017; (ii) an $18 million decrease in restructuring efforts; and (iii) a $14 million decrease related to integration costs associated with acquisitions.\nOn July 2, 2018, we redeemed the original stated value of $750 million of the Koch Preferred Securities for total consideration of approximately $949 million using proceeds from the IPO and cash on hand. The total consideration paid includes approximately $103 million related to the redemption premium and tax reimbursements, as well as $96 million related to the accumulated dividend obligation on the Koch Preferred Securities. We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $213 million as a result of the redemption. The remaining proceeds from the IPO were used to pay IPO related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes.\nincrease in dealer generated customer accounts and bulk account purchases, subscriber system asset additions, and capital expenditures is due to incremental volume as a result of the timing of the ADT Acquisition in 2016. Additionally, we received net proceeds of $42 million from the termination of derivative financial instruments related to the ADT Acquisition during 2016.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt was $4 million and $28 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 and the supplemental pro forma year ended December 31, 2016, respectively, and related to amendments and restatements to the First Lien Credit Agreement in 2017, and the write-off of debt discount and issuance costs associated with the voluntary paydown of $260 million of a second lien term loans in July and October 2016 and the amendments and restatements to the First Lien Credit Agreement in 2016.\nDuring 2017, cash flows provided by operating activities increased by approximately $974 million compared to 2016 based on the activity described below.\nFree Cash Flow\n (ii) incremental first lien term loan borrowings of $1,555 million and the issuance of $3,140 million of the Prime Notes; and \n 1(c) Reflects the impact of: \n\nN/A-Not applicable\nThe table below reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to net (loss) income for the periods presented.\n 1(f) To record incremental interest expense (including related amortization of debt issuance costs and discount) of $168 million associated with borrowings to fund the ADT Acquisition as a result of: (1) the incremental first lien term loan facility of $1,555 million; (2) the issuance of $3,140 million of Prime Notes; (3) the amortization of issuance costs and fees associated with a $255 million revolving credit facility; (4) the Koch Preferred Securities, which have an aggregate stated value of $750 million (dividends for the Koch Preferred Securities are recorded as interest expense); and (5) the amortization of the fair value adjustment made to the ADT Notes assumed as a result of the acquisition. These increases are net of the removal of interest expense of $11 million on The ADT Corporation debt repaid (including related amortization of capitalized debt acquisition costs) in connection with the consummation of the acquisition. \nNON-GAAP MEASURES\n\nGross customer revenue attrition is calculated on a trailing twelve-month basis, the numerator of which is the annualized RMR lost during the period due to attrition, net of dealer charge-backs and reinstated customers, excluding contracts monitored but not owned, and the denominator of which is total annualized RMR based on an average of RMR under contract at the beginning of each month during the period.\n (iii) favorable legal settlements of $17.5 million due to two settlements during 2018.  Depreciation and Intangible Asset Amortization\n2018 Compared to 2017\nTax Reform was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The legislation, among other things, reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, imposed a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, imposed significant limitations on the deductibility of interest, allowed for the full expensing of capital expenditures, and put into effect the migration from a worldwide\u201d system of taxation to a modified territorial system. In response to Tax Reform, the SEC issued SAB 118 that allowed companies to record provisional estimates of the effects of the legislative change, and a one-year measurement period to finalize the accounting of those effects. The total provisional amount recorded in 2017 was $690 million and included a remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as the impact of the mandatory one-time tax on\nThe monthly fees that we generate from any individual customer vary based on the level of service we provide to the customer and customer tenure. We offer a wide range of services at various price points from basic burglar alarm monitoring to our full suite of interactive services. Our ability to increase monthly fees at the individual customer level depends on a number of factors, including our ability to effectively introduce and market additional features and services that increase the value of our offerings to customers, which we believe drives customers to purchase higher levels of service and supports our ability to make periodic adjustments to pricing.\nASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and related amendments, establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. We adopted this new standard and its related amendments effective on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method, whereby the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard is recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of stockholders' equity. Results for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 are presented under this new standard, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for the prior period.\nMerger, Restructuring, Integration, and Other\nSubscriber System Assets, net and Deferred Subscriber Acquisition Costs, net\nrate calculated as, at our option, either (a) LIBOR determined by reference to the costs of funds for Eurodollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing, adjusted for certain additional costs ( Adjusted LIBOR\u201d) with a floor of 1.00%, or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% per annum, (ii) the prime rate published by The Wall Street Journal, and (iii) one-month adjusted LIBOR plus 1.00% per annum ( Base Rate\u201d), in each case, plus the applicable margin of 2.75% for Adjusted LIBOR loans and 1.75% for Base Rate loans. We have interest rate swap contracts with the objective of managing exposure to variability in interest rates on our debt.\nOVERVIEW\nIn addition, we offer professional monitoring of third-party devices by enabling other companies to integrate solutions into our monitoring and billing platform. This allows us to provide monitoring solutions to customers who do not currently have an installed ADT security system or interactive automation platform.\n\nPrime Notes\nFree Cash Flow\n_______________________\nLong-Term Debt\nDepreciation and Intangible Asset Amortization\nBASIS OF PRESENTATION\nFACTORS AFFECTING OPERATING RESULTS\n\n (3) Represents adjustments related to the fair value of deferred revenue under GAAP, primarily related to the ADT Acquisition in 2016 and the Red Hawk Acquisition in 2018. \nprimarily associated with the Protection One trade name, which we began amortizing in July 2016, and (iii) amortization of software license expenses of $37 million related to the cloud computing accounting standard.\nMerger, Restructuring, Integration, and Other\nDepreciation and intangible asset amortization increased by $630 million during 2017. This increase primarily related to depreciation and intangible asset amortization associated with the fair value of assets acquired in the ADT Acquisition, which primarily includes amortization of definite-lived intangible assets and depreciation of subscriber system assets. Additionally, the increase in depreciation and intangible asset amortization was also attributable to (i) an increase in amortization of customer contracts acquired under the ADT Authorized Dealer Program of $104 million, (ii) an increase in amortization of $42 million\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Prime Notes have an outstanding balance of $2,546 million. which represents the following events:\nCost of revenue increased by $146 million during 2018. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to $118 million from installation costs associated with a higher volume of sales where security-related equipment is sold outright to customers, the majority of which is due to the incremental volume associated with acquisitions. The remaining increase is due to an increase in our field and maintenance service expenses, of which approximately $15 million is related to incremental expenses associated with acquisitions.\n (iii) issuance by ADT Inc. of 750,000 shares of the Koch Preferred Securities and issuance by Ultimate Parent of the Warrants to the Koch Investor for an aggregate amount of $750 million. \nWe expect our ongoing sources of liquidity to include cash generated from operations, as well as borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the issuance of equity and/or debt securities as appropriate given market conditions. Our future cash needs are expected to include cash for operating activities, working capital, capital expenditures, strategic investments, periodic principal and interest payments on our debt, and potential dividend payments to our stockholders. We may, from time to time, seek to repay, redeem, repurchase, or refinance our indebtedness, or seek to retire or purchase our outstanding securities through cash purchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions or through a 10b5-1 repurchase plan or otherwise, and any such transactions may involve material amounts. We believe our cash position, borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facilities, and cash provided by operating activities are, and will continue to be, adequate to meet our operational and business needs in the next twelve months as well as our long-term liquidity needs.\nInitial Public Offering\n___________________\nCost of revenue increased $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the supplemental pro forma year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cost of revenue was attributable to increased costs of approximately $25 million related to installation costs associated with a higher volume of sales where security-related equipment is sold outright to customers and approximately $23 million in field and maintenance service expenses incurred to enhance service levels and lower customer backlog. These were partially offset by decreased customer care expenses of approximately $22 million, which consisted of reduced software license expenses related to a newly adopted cloud computing accounting standard, partially offset by investments in customer care associated with enhanced customer revenue attrition improvement initiatives.\nIn January 2018, in connection with the consummation of our IPO, we received net proceeds of $1,406 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and offering expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA\n (i) the elimination of The ADT Corporation historical amortization of deferred subscriber acquisition costs of $52 million as a result of the purchase price allocation for the ADT Acquisition as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2015 because the application of this purchase accounting adjustment has a continuing impact on the Company; and \n \u2022 May 2, 2016 - $3,140 million of borrowings in connection with the ADT Acquisition; and \n_____________________\nIncome tax benefit was $764 million in 2017, resulting in an effective tax rate for the period of 181.3%. The effective tax rate primarily reflects the favorable impact of Tax Reform offset by the unfavorable impact of permanent tax adjustments.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nEffective March 11, 2019, we declared a cash dividend on our common stock of $0.035 per share payable to common stockholders of record on April 2, 2019. This dividend will be paid on April 12, 2019.\n (2) Refer to the Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations-Key Performance Indicators\u201d section for the definitions of these key performance indicators. \n \u2022 Prior to May 15, 2019, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, (a) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Prime Notes redeemed, plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest as of, but excluding, the redemption date or (b) for up to 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Prime Notes and in an aggregate amount equal to the net cash proceeds of any equity offerings, at a redemption price equal to 109.250%, plus accrued and unpaid interest, so long as at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Prime Notes shall remain outstanding after each such redemption. \nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nLong-Lived Asset Impairments\nTotal consideration in connection with the ADT Acquisition was $12,114 million, which included the assumption of The ADT Corporation's outstanding debt (inclusive of capital lease obligations) at a fair value of $3,551 million on the acquisition date, and cash of approximately $54 million.\n \u25e6 Reduced by regularly scheduled quarterly principal payments.  The First Lien Term B-1 Loan requires scheduled quarterly payments equal to 0.25% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount, or approximately $10 million per quarter, with the remaining balance payable at maturity. In addition, we are required to make annual prepayments on the outstanding First Lien Term B-1 Loan with a percentage of our excess cash flow, as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement, if our excess cash flow exceeds a certain specified threshold. We are not currently required to make any annual prepayments based on our excess cash flow. We may make voluntarily prepayments on the First Lien Term B-1 Loan at any time prior to maturity at par. The First Lien Term B-1 Loan has a variable interest\n (3) Represents the minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2018. Some agreements have renewal options. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating leases. Refer to Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 for further discussion. \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAs of December 31, 2018, we have the following outstanding debt balances (excluding capital leases, deferred financing costs, discount, and fair value adjustments):\nDuring 2017, other income primarily includes $24 million of foreign currency gains related to the conversion of intercompany loans that are denominated in Canadian dollars. During the first quarter of 2018, we designated certain of these intercompany loans to be of a long-term-investment nature and began recognizing the related foreign currency gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nWe recognize positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return in the financial statements when it is more likely than-not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50%) that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. A recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit with greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We record liabilities for positions that have been taken but do not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold. We adjust the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a change to the estimated income taxes.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for 2017 resulted from $1,550 million of net income, exclusive of depreciation and intangible assets amortization and other non-cash items, and reflects: (i) cash interest paid of $661 million, (ii) cash paid of $64 million for fees associated with the Special Dividend and fees in connection with amendments and restatements to the First Lien Credit Agreement, (iii) restructuring payments of $25 million and integration payments of $21 million primarily associated with the ADT Acquisition, (iv) cash paid for fees under the Management Consulting Agreement of $20 million, (v) cash paid for radio conversion costs of $13 million, and (vi) other cash payments of $10 million. The remainder relates to changes in assets and liabilities due to the volume and timing of other operating cash receipts and payments.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the supplemental pro forma year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease primarily relates to decreases in radio conversion costs of $56 million related to a program that began in 2015 to upgrade cellular technology used in many of our security systems and decreases related to reductions in costs as a result of the integration of The ADT Corporation business, including (i) general and administrative expenses of approximately $37 million, (ii) advertising costs of approximately $33 million, and (iii) selling and marketing costs of approximately $27 million.\n 1(e) To remove transaction costs associated with the ADT Acquisition, as these costs will not have a continuing impact on the Company's results. \nDuring 2017, cash flows used in investing activities decreased by approximately $7,998 million compared to 2016 due to the following: (i) a decrease in cash used for business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $8,438 million due to the ADT Acquisition in 2016; (ii) an increase in dealer generated customer accounts and bulk account purchases of $246 million; (iii) an increase in subscriber system asset additions of $114 million; and (iv) an increase in capital expenditures of $52 million. The\nAdjusted EBITDA\n1. Unaudited Supplemental Pro Forma Statement of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2016 \nGoodwill\nThere are material limitations to using Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account certain significant items, including depreciation and amortization, interest, taxes, and other adjustments which directly affect our net income or loss. These limitations are best addressed by considering the economic effects of the excluded items independently and by considering Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA may be presented on a supplemental pro forma basis. Refer to the -Supplemental Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d section for further discussion regarding the presentation of supplemental pro forma financial information.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nUnder a quantitative approach, we estimate the fair value of the asset and compare it to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is determined based on the nature of the underlying asset. Our only indefinite-lived intangible asset is the ADT trade name. The fair value of the ADT trade name is determined under a relief from royalty method, which is an income approach that estimates the cost savings that accrue to us that we would otherwise have to pay in the form of royalties or license fees on revenue earned through the use of the asset. The utilization of the relief from royalty method requires us to make significant assumptions including revenue growth rates, the implied royalty rate, and the discount rate.\n \u25e6 May 2, 2016 - $1,555 million of borrowings in connection with the ADT Acquisition; \nAs of December 31, 2018, our guarantees totaled $54 million and primarily related to standby letters of credit on our insurance programs.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nRefer to the discussions above under -Results of Operations\u201d for further details.\nPurchases of contracts with customers under the ADT Authorized Dealer Program, or from other third parties, are accounted for using pools based on the month and year of acquisition. We amortize our pooled contracts with customers using an accelerated method over the estimated life of the customer relationship, which is 15 years. The accelerated method for amortizing these\n (2) Gross customer revenue attrition for 2016 is presented on a pro forma basis for The ADT Corporation business. \nWe define Free Cash Flow as cash flows from operating activities less cash outlays related to capital expenditures. We define capital expenditures to include purchases of property, plant, and equipment; subscriber system asset additions and deferred subscriber installation costs; and accounts purchased through our network of authorized dealers or third parties outside of our authorized dealer network. These items are subtracted from cash flows from operating activities because they represent long-term investments that are required for normal business activities.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nDuring the first quarter of 2018 and in connection with the IPO, we redeemed Class B Units in Ultimate Parent in full for the number of shares of our common stock ( Distributed Shares\u201d) that would have been distributed to such holder under the terms of Ultimate Parent's operating agreement in a hypothetical liquidation on the date of the IPO at the initial public offering price ( Class B Unit Redemption\u201d), which resulted in a modification of both the shares subject to time-based vesting ( Distributed Shares Service Tranche\u201d) and shares subject to vesting based upon the achievement of certain investment return thresholds by Apollo ( Distributed Shares Performance Tranche\u201d). The modification of the Distributed Shares Performance Tranche resulted in a significant increase in fair value, whereas the impact of the modification on the Distributed Shares Service Tranche was not material. Additionally, upon consummation of the IPO, we approved our 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan ( 2018 Plan\u201d). Under the 2018 Plan, and in connection with the Class B Unit Redemption, we also granted options to holders of Class B Units ( Top-up Options\u201d). The Class B Unit Redemption and Top-up Options resulted in the increase in share-based compensation expense during 2018.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that we believe is useful to investors to measure the operational strength and performance of our business. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA, a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) (the most comparable GAAP measure), and additional information, including a description of the limitations relating to the use of Adjusted EBITDA, are provided under -Non-GAAP Measures.\u201d In addition, Adjusted EBITDA may be presented on a supplemental pro forma basis. Refer to the -Supplemental Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d section for further discussion regarding the presentation of supplemental pro forma financial information.\n 1(a) The ADT Corporation's historical combined statement of operations data for the period January 1, 2016 to May 1, 2016 has been derived by adding the historical consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and the historical consolidated statement of operations data for the period April 1, 2016 to May 1, 2016. Certain expenses have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. \nWe have presented below the financial information and operating results for the year ended December 31, 2017 on a historical basis compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 on a supplemental pro forma basis.\nInstallation and other revenue increased by $186 million during 2018. This increase was primarily due to $153 million related to revenue from security equipment sold outright to customers, of which approximately $99 million related to incremental revenue associated with acquisitions. The remaining increase of $33 million was due to additional amortization of deferred subscriber acquisition revenue during 2018.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nCost of Revenue\nFirst Lien Credit Agreement\n (2) Relates to the conversion of intercompany loans that are denominated in Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars. \nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe increase in monitoring and related services was primarily attributable to an increase in contractual monthly recurring fees for monitoring and other recurring services, which resulted from the addition of new customers and improvements in average pricing, partially offset by customer attrition. The improvement in average pricing was driven by the addition of new customers at higher rates, largely due to new subscribers generally selecting higher priced services as compared to our existing customers, as well as price escalations on our existing customer base. These factors also were the primary driver for an increase in RMR to $335 million as of December 31, 2017 from $328 million as of December 31, 2016. Gross customer revenue attrition improved to 13.7% as of December 31, 2017 from 14.8% as of December 31, 2016 as a result of our enhanced focus on high quality customer additions through our disciplined customer selection process.\nIncome Taxes\nAll financial information presented in this section has been prepared in U.S. dollars in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) and include the accounts of ADT Inc. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.\n 1(g) To record the income tax expense impact of the supplemental pro forma adjustments at the blended statutory rate of 38.4%.  Components of Unaudited Supplemental Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA\nTotal revenue increased $149 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the supplemental pro forma year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was a result of an increase in monitoring and related services of $75 million and an increase in installation and other revenue of $74 million.\n \u25e6 June 23, 2016 - $125 million of borrowings in order to payoff and terminate a second lien term loan; \nEarly termination of the contract by the customer results in a termination charge in accordance with the contract terms. Contract termination charges are recognized in monitoring and related services revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations when collectability is probable. Amounts collected from customers for sales and other taxes are reported net of the related amounts remitted.\nOur principal liquidity requirements are to finance current operations, investments in internally generated subscriber system assets and dealer generated customer accounts, expenditures for property and equipment, debt service requirements, and potential mergers and acquisitions. Our liquidity requirements are primarily funded by our cash flows from operations, which include cash received from monthly recurring revenue and upfront fees received from customers, less cash costs to provide services to our customers, including general and administrative costs, certain costs associated with acquiring new customers, and interest payments.\n (ii) As of the acquisition date, subscriber system assets have a weighted-average remaining useful life of approximately 7 years and are depreciated on an accelerated basis. Property and equipment has a remaining average life of 3 years and are depreciated on a straight-line basis. \nCost of revenue increased by $202 million during 2017. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to (i) an increase in field and maintenance service expenses of $89 million primarily associated with the operations of The ADT Corporation, including expenses incurred for service calls for customers who have maintenance contracts, and (ii) an increase in customer care expenses of $75 million primarily attributable to costs associated with the operations of The ADT Corporation, as well as investments associated with enhanced customer revenue attrition improvement initiatives, which was partially offset by reduced software license expenses related to a cloud computing accounting standard adopted in 2016. The remainder of the increase in cost of revenue was due to increased installation costs of approximately $38 million associated with a higher volume of sales where security-related equipment is sold outright to customers.\nRefer to the discussion below under -Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for further details regarding cash flows from operating activities.\nAttrition has a direct impact on the number of customers we monitor and service, as well as our financial results, including revenue, operating income, and cash flows. A portion of our customer base can be expected to cancel its service every year. Customers may choose not to renew or may terminate their contracts for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, relocation, cost, loss to competition, or service issues.\nThe following table provides a summary of our commitments and contractual obligations for debt, leases, and other purchase obligations as of December 31, 2018.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nWe review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be fully recoverable. We group assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identified. Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying value of the asset group to its expected future undiscounted cash flows. If the expected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value, less the cost to sell, of the asset group. The calculation of the fair value, less cost to sell, of an asset group is based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk.\nRefer to the discussions above under -Results of Operations\u201d for further details.\nThe table below reconciles Free Cash Flow to cash flows from operating activities for the periods presented.\nWe capitalize certain costs associated with transactions in which we retain ownership of the security system as well as incremental selling expenses related to acquiring customers. These costs include equipment, installation costs, and other incremental costs. Subscriber system assets represent capitalized equipment and installation costs incurred in connection with transactions in which we retain ownership of the security system. Upon customer termination, we may retrieve such assets. These assets have a probable future economic benefit for us as they contribute to the generation of future monitoring and related services revenue for us. Deferred subscriber acquisition costs, net represent incremental selling expenses (primarily commissions) related to acquiring customers.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nAs of December 31, 2018, we have approximately $200 million of goodwill allocated to our Canada reporting unit, which reflects a goodwill impairment loss of $88 million recorded due to its underperformance in 2018. During the fourth quarter there were changes to the Canadian leadership team and also revisions to our outlook for the reporting unit completed as part of our annual budgeting process. As a result of the goodwill impairment loss, the carrying value of the Canada reporting unit approximates its fair value, and as such, is considered at risk of future impairment. If our assumptions are not realized, or if there are changes in any of the assumptions in the future due to a change in economic conditions, it is possible that an impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future. Our other reporting units are not considered at risk due to the excess of their fair values over their carrying values. Refer to Note 4 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 for further discussion.\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations, summary cash flow data, and key performance indicators for the periods presented.\nIncome Tax Benefit\n (4) Represents the principal and interest payments on our capital lease obligations as of December 31, 2018. Refer to Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 for further discussion. \nOther Income (Expense)\nRadio Conversion Costs\nKEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\nDefinite-lived intangible assets primarily include contracts and related customer and dealer relationships that originated from the Formation Transactions and the ADT Acquisition as well as contracts with customers purchased under the ADT Authorized Dealer Program, or from other third parties.\nThe increase in installation and other revenue was due to (i) approximately $38 million related to revenue from security equipment sold outright to customers and (ii) approximately $36 million of additional revenue generated from new customer additions associated with the amortization of deferred installation revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the supplemental pro forma year ended December 31, 2016.\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. In determining taxable income for our consolidated financial statements, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. We record the effect of a tax rate or law change on our deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period of enactment. Future tax rate or law changes could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.\n___________________________\nNet interest expense was primarily comprised of interest expense on our long-term debt and the dividend obligation associated with the Koch Preferred Securities and increased by $211 million during 2017. The increase in interest expense was primarily the result of an increase in borrowings to fund the ADT Acquisition, including the dividend obligation associated with the Koch Preferred Securities. Refer to the -Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section for further discussion regarding our debt and interest.\nFor further details on the drivers of these changes, refer to the discussions above.\nUnder a qualitative approach, the impairment review for an indefinite-lived intangible asset consists of an assessment of whether it is more-likely-than-not that an asset's fair value is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset, or if a qualitative assessment indicates it is more-likely-than-not that the estimated carrying value of such asset exceeds its fair value, we proceed to a quantitative approach.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss adjusted for (i) interest, (ii) taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, including depreciation of subscriber system assets and other fixed assets and amortization of dealer and other intangible assets, (iv) amortization of deferred costs and deferred revenue associated with subscriber acquisitions, (v) share-based compensation expense, (vi) purchase accounting adjustments under GAAP, (vii) merger, restructuring, integration, and other, (viii) goodwill impairment losses, (ix) financing and consent fees, (x) foreign currency gains/losses, (xi) losses on extinguishment of debt, (xii) radio conversion costs, (xiii) management fees and other charges, and (xiv) other non-cash items.\nGross Customer Revenue Attrition\nCash Outlays Related to Capital Expenditures\n (4) Represents costs associated with upgrading cellular technology used in many of our security systems. \nThe unaudited supplemental pro forma year ended December 31, 2016 has been derived from (i) the Company's historical consolidated financial information for the year ended December 31, 2016 included in this document, (ii) The ADT Corporation's historical condensed consolidated financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2016, and (iii) The ADT Corporation's historical condensed consolidated financial information for the period April 1, 2016 to May 1, 2016, as illustrated in the table below:\nIncome tax benefit was $266 million during 2016, resulting in an effective tax rate for the period of 33.2%. The effective tax rate for 2016 primarily reflects the impact of permanent tax adjustments mainly related to non-deductible acquisition costs associated with the ADT Acquisition.\nNet interest expense decreased $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the supplemental pro forma year ended December 31, 2016. Net interest expense is primarily comprised of interest expense on our long-term debt. The decrease in interest expense is primarily related to the voluntary paydown of $260 million of a second lien term loan in July and October 2016.\nWe record accruals for losses that we believe are probable to occur and are reasonably estimable. These accruals are based on judgment, the probability of losses, and where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates. Legal costs in connection with claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business are expensed as incurred. Additionally, we record insurance recovery receivables from third-party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable.\nFree Cash Flow\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nSUPPLEMENTAL MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\n (1) In 2017, relates to fees incurred in connection with the Special Dividend and amendments and restatements related to the First Lien Credit Agreement. \nAs of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all financial covenant and other maintenance tests for all our debt obligations.\nDividends\n (3) Adjusted EBITDA and Supplemental Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. Refer to the Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Non-GAAP Measures\u201d section for the definitions thereof and below for reconciliations to net income (loss), the most comparable GAAP measure, as well as the equivalent reconciliations on a supplemental pro forma basis.  Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Unaudited Supplemental Pro Forma Year Ended December 31, 2016\nAs of December 31, 2018, we serve approximately 7.2 million recurring customers, excluding contracts monitored but not owned. We are one of the largest full-service companies with a national footprint providing both residential and commercial monitored security. We deliver an integrated customer experience by maintaining the industry's largest sales, installation, and service field force, as well as a 24/7 professional monitoring network.\nWe funded the ADT Acquisition, as well as related transaction costs, using the net proceeds from a combination of the following:\nDefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\n (1) Refer to Note 1 to Notes to the Unaudited Supplemental Pro Forma Financial Information presented in the Supplemental Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \nOther income (expense) was primarily attributable to net foreign currency gains of $24 million and losses of $16 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to the conversion of intercompany loans that are denominated in Canadian dollars. Other expense during 2016 also includes a net loss on the settlement of derivative contracts that were executed to hedge future cash flows associated with the ADT Acquisition.\nUnder a quantitative approach, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The fair value of a reporting unit is determined using the income approach which discounts projected cash flows using market participant assumptions. The discounted cash flow methodology includes significant assumptions including, but not limited to, forecasted revenue, operating profit margins, operating expenses, cash flows, perpetual growth rates, and long-term discount rates. The resulting fair value under a quantitative approach is sensitive to changes in the underlying assumptions. In developing these assumptions, we rely on various factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and other market data. Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying judgments and factors and ultimately impact the estimated fair value determinations may include such items as a prolonged downturn in the business environment, changes in economic conditions that significantly differ from our assumptions in timing or degree, volatility in equity and debt markets resulting in higher discount rates, and unexpected regulatory changes. As a result, there are inherent uncertainties related to these judgments and factors in applying them to the goodwill impairment test.\nAs a result of our IPO, we incur additional legal, accounting, board compensation, and other expenses that we did not previously incur prior to becoming a public company, including costs associated with SEC reporting and corporate governance requirements. These requirements include compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, as well as other rules implemented by the SEC and the national securities exchanges. Our financial statements following our IPO reflect the impact of these expenses.\nIn connection with the ADT Acquisition, $718 million aggregate principal amount of the existing ADT Notes due 2042 were exchanged for new ADT Notes due 2032. In August 2016, an additional $10 million of the ADT Notes due 2042 were exchanged for ADT Notes due 2032 pursuant to a second supplemental indenture and constitute part of the same series of notes as the $718 million of the ADT Notes due 2032.\n\nDepreciation and intangible asset amortization increased $289 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the supplemental pro forma year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to (i) higher depreciation expense of approximately $111 million related to subscriber system assets, which included costs associated with new customer additions and upgrades; (ii) increased amortization of approximately $104 million related to new customer contracts acquired as a result of the ADT Authorized Dealer Program; and (iii) increased amortization expense of $42 million primarily associated with the Protection One trade name, which we began amortizing in July 2016. The remainder of the increase was primarily due to increased software license expenses related to a newly adopted cloud computing standard mentioned above.\n\n (5) In 2018, primarily includes income of approximately $22 million of one-time licensing fees, as well as a gain of $7.5 million from the sale of equity in a third party that we received as part of a settlement during the second quarter of 2018 partially offset by $14 million in compensation arrangements related to acquisitions. In 2017 and 2016, primarily represents fees under a Management Consulting Agreement, which was terminated in connection with the consummation of the IPO.  2018 Compared to 2017\nWe maintain agreements with a network of third-party independent alarm dealers who sell alarm equipment and ADT Authorized Dealer-branded monitoring and interactive services to end users. The dealers in this program generate new end-user contracts with customers which we have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase from the dealer. Purchases of contracts with customers under the ADT Authorized Dealer Program, or from other third parties, are considered asset acquisitions and are recorded at their contractually determined purchase price. We may charge back the purchase price of any end-user contract if the contract is canceled during the charge-back period, which is generally twelve to fifteen months from the date of purchase. We record the amount of the charge back as a reduction to the purchase price.\n______________________\nCost of Revenue\nThe effective tax rates in 2018 and 2017 reflect the tax impact of permanent tax adjustments, state tax expense, changes in tax laws, and non-U.S. net earnings. The effective tax rate can vary from period to period due to permanent tax adjustments, discrete items such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, recurring factors such as changes in the overall effective state tax rate, as well as fluctuations in pre-tax income or loss. Discrete items and permanent tax adjustments will have a greater impact on the effective tax rate when pre-tax income or loss is lower. Refer to Note 7 Income Taxes\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 for further discussion.\nDealer generated customer accounts and bulk account purchases, subscriber system assets and deferred subscriber installation costs, and capital expenditures are included in cash flows from investing activities. Refer to the discussion below under -Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for further details regarding cash flows from investing activities.\n \u2022 February 21, 2018 - $594 million of the aggregate principal amount was voluntarily redeemed at a price of $649 million using proceeds from the IPO  The Prime Notes are due at maturity, however, may be redeemed at our option as follows:\nFree Cash Flow adjusts for cash items that are ultimately within management's discretion to direct, and therefore, may imply that there is less or more cash that is available than the most comparable GAAP measure. Free Cash Flow is not intended to represent residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures since debt repayment requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures are not deducted. These limitations are best addressed by using Free Cash Flow in combination with the cash flows as calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nGross customer revenue attrition is defined as the RMR lost as a result of customer attrition, net of dealer charge-backs and reinstated customers, excluding contracts monitored but not owned. Customer sites are considered canceled when all services are terminated. Dealer charge-backs represent customer cancellations charged back to the dealers because the customer canceled service during the charge-back period, generally twelve to fifteen months.\nOur subscriber-based business requires significant upfront investment to generate new customers, which in turn provides predictable recurring revenue generated from our monitoring and other services. In order to optimize returns on customer acquisitions and cash flow generation, we focus on the following key drivers of our business: best-in-class customer service; increased customer retention; disciplined, high-quality customer additions; efficient customer acquisition; and reduced costs incurred to provide ongoing services to customers.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\n2017 Compared to 2016\n\nRecurring Monthly Revenue ( RMR\u201d)\nIncome tax benefit was $764 million during 2017, resulting in an effective tax rate for the period of 181.3%. The effective tax rate for 2017 reflects the favorable impact of Tax Reform offset by the unfavorable impact of permanent tax adjustments.\n \u2022 On or after May 15, 2019, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 104.625% of the principal amount of the Prime Notes redeemed and accrued and unpaid interest as of, but excluding, the redemption date. The redemption price decreases to 102.313% on or after May 15, 2020, and decreases to 100.000% on or after May 15, 2021.  On February 1, 2019, we redeemed $300 million aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Prime Notes for a total redemption price of $319 million. Following the partial redemption, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Prime Notes was $2,246 million.\nin financial condition, and results of operations. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements about our business, operations, and financial performance based on current plans and estimates that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections of this Annual Report titled Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOn February 27, 2019, we approved a dividend reinvestment plan ( DRIP\u201d) which will allow stockholders to designate all or a portion of the cash dividends on their shares of common stock for reinvestment in additional shares of our common stock. In addition, on February 27, 2019 we approved a share repurchase program which will permit us to repurchase up to $150 million of our shares of common stock through February 27, 2021. We may effect these repurchases pursuant to one or more trading plans to be adopted in accordance with Securities Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1, in privately negotiated transactions, in open market transactions or pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase program. We intend to conduct the share repurchase program in accordance with Securities Exchange Act Rule 10b-18. We are not obligated to repurchase any of our shares of common stock and the timing and amount of any repurchases will depend on legal requirements, market conditions, stock price, alternative uses of capital, and other factors.\nPublic Company Costs\nRMR is generated by contractual monthly recurring fees for monitoring and other recurring services provided to our customers, including contracts monitored but not owned. We believe the presentation of RMR is useful because it measures the volume of revenue under contract at a given point in time.\n (ii) the elimination of The ADT Corporation historical amortization of deferred installation revenue of $58 million as a result of the purchase price allocation for the ADT Acquisition as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2015 because the application of this purchase accounting adjustment has a continuing impact on the Company. \n (i) Primarily consists of amortization of customer relationships and dealer relationships under the ADT Authorized Dealer Program. As of the acquisition date, customer relationships have a weighted-average remaining useful life of approximately 6 years and are amortized on an accelerated basis. \n\n_______________________\nTotal Revenue\nMonitoring and related services revenue increased by $81 million during 2018, which includes incremental revenue associated with acquisitions. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in contractual monthly recurring fees for monitoring and other recurring services, which resulted from the addition of new customers and improvements in average pricing, partially offset by customer attrition. The improvement in average pricing was driven by the addition of new customers at higher rates, largely due to new subscribers generally selecting higher priced services as compared to our existing customers, as well as price escalations on our existing customer base. These factors also were a primary driver for the increase in RMR to $347 million as of December 31, 2018 from $335 million as of December 31, 2017. In addition, approximately 2% of the 4% increase in RMR was due to the Red Hawk Acquisition. Gross customer revenue attrition improved to 13.3% as of December 31, 2018 from 13.7% as of December 31, 2017 as a result of lower voluntary disconnects and lower disconnects due to non-paying customers.\nCash Flow Analysis\nThe following table is a summary of our cash flow activity for the periods presented:\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized and are tested for impairment at least annually as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and more often if an event occurs or circumstances change which indicate it is more-likely-than-not that fair value is less than carrying amount. The annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets may be completed through qualitative assessments. We may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to a quantitative impairment test for any reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period. We may resume the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset in any subsequent period.\nOur ability to add new subscribers depends on the overall demand for our products and solutions, which is driven by a number of external factors. The overall economic condition in the geographies in which we operate can impact our ability to attract new customers and grow our business in all customer channels. Growth in our residential customer base can be influenced by the overall state of the housing market. Growth in our commercial customer base can be influenced by the rate at which new businesses begin operations or existing businesses grow. The demand for our products and solutions is also impacted by the perceived threat of crime, as well as the quality of the service of our competitors.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nLoss on extinguishment of debt in 2018 includes approximately $213 million associated with the Koch Redemption in July 2018, which related to the payment of the redemption premium and tax reimbursements, as well as the write-off of the unamortized discount and deferred financing costs. In addition, loss on extinguishment of debt includes approximately $62 million primarily associated with the partial redemption of the Prime Notes in February 2018, which related to the payment of the call premium, as well as the write-off of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs. Loss on extinguishment of debt in 2017 was not material.\n (2) Relates to the conversion of intercompany loans that are denominated in Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars. \nUnder a qualitative approach, the impairment test for goodwill consists of an assessment of whether it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit, or if a qualitative assessment indicates it is more-likely-than-not that the estimated carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we proceed to a quantitative approach.\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations and other capital requirements, including capital expenditures, as well as make acquisitions, will depend on our future operating performance, which is subject to future general economic, financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other conditions, many of which are beyond our control. See -Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business.\u201d Changes in our operating plans, material changes in anticipated sales, increased expenses, acquisitions, or other events may cause us to seek equity and/or debt financing in future periods. There can be no guarantee that financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Debt financing, if available, could impose additional cash payment obligations and subject us to additional covenants and operating restrictions.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nTo provide investors with additional information in connection with our results as determined by GAAP, we disclose Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow as non-GAAP measures. These measures are not financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flows, or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nRevenue Recognition\nIn transactions involving security systems that are sold outright to the customer, our performance obligations generally include monitoring, related services, and the sale and installation of the security systems. For such arrangements, we allocate a portion of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price. Revenue associated with the sale and installation of security systems is recognized once installation is complete and is reflected in installation and other revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Revenue associated with monitoring and related services is recognized as those services are provided and is reflected in monitoring and related services revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nTotal Revenue\nDuring 2018, cash flows provided by operating activities increased by approximately $196 million compared to 2017 due to the following: (i) an increase in revenue from contractual monthly recurring fees for monitoring and other recurring services; (ii) an increase in revenue from transactions in which security equipment is sold outright to customers partially offset by the associated costs; (iii) a decrease in cash paid related to acquisition, integration, and restructuring costs associated with the ADT Acquisition; and (iv) a decrease in cash paid of $55 million for fees associated with the Special Dividend and fees in connection with amendments and restatements to the First Lien Credit Agreement. These increases in cash flows provided by operating activities were partially offset by a net increase in cash interest paid of $27 million due to the Koch Redemption and higher interest rates on variable-rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, partially offset by a decrease in cash interest paid due to the partial redemption of the Prime Notes in 2018. The remainder of the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities relates to changes in assets and liabilities due to the volume and timing of other operating cash receipts and payments with respect to when the transactions are reflected in earnings.\n (1) In 2017, relates to fees incurred in connection with the Special Dividend and amendments and restatements related to the First Lien Credit Agreement. \nNOTES TO THE UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTAL PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe are also subject to a springing financial maintenance covenant under the First Lien Credit Agreement, which requires us to not exceed a specified first lien leverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter if the testing conditions are satisfied. The covenant is tested if the outstanding loans under the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility, subject to certain exceptions, exceed 30% of the total commitments under the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility at the testing date (i.e., the last day of any fiscal quarter).\n (3) Represents costs associated with upgrading cellular technology used in many of our security systems. \nDepreciation and intangible asset amortization increased by $68 million during 2018. This increase was primarily attributable to $100 million associated with the amortization of customer contracts acquired under the ADT Authorized Dealer Program, partially offset by a decrease in the amortization of trade names of $41 million primarily associated with the Protection One trade name, which became fully amortized in June 2018.\n \u2022 As of December 31, 2018, the First Lien Term B-1 Loan has an outstanding aggregate principal balance of $3,924 million, which represents the following events: \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $38 million during 2018. The increase was related to $124 million associated with our equity compensation awards, which were impacted by the completion of our IPO, $11 million related to compensation arrangements associated with acquisitions, as well as other incremental general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by:\ncontracts utilizes an average declining balance rate of approximately 300% and converts to straight-line methodology when the resulting amortization charge is greater than that from the accelerated method, resulting in an average amortization of approximately 65% of the pool within the first five years, 25% within the second five years, and 10% within the final five years.\nThe largest impact from the new standard relates to the timing of recognition of certain incremental selling costs associated with acquiring new customers. Under the new standard, certain costs previously amortized over the initial contract term will now be amortized in pools based on the expected life of a customer relationship using an accelerated method over 15 years. To a lesser extent, the adoption of the new standard impacted the identification of performance obligations and the allocation of transaction price to those performance obligations for certain sales of security systems sold outright to customers.\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years, and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions, including the amount of future pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage its underlying businesses.\nOn July 2, 2018, we redeemed the original stated value of $750 million of the Koch Preferred Securities for total consideration of approximately $949 million using proceeds from the IPO and cash on hand. The total consideration paid includes approximately $103 million related to the redemption premium and tax reimbursements, as well as $96 million related to the accumulated dividend obligation on the Koch Preferred Securities. We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $213 million as a result of the redemption. The dividend obligation incurred on the Koch Preferred Securities was $51 million, $86 million, and $53 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The remaining proceeds from the IPO were used to pay IPO related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes.\n \u25e6 February 13, 2017 - $800 million of borrowings in order to fund the Special Dividend; \nRed Hawk Acquisition\nCost of Revenue\nAdjusted EBITDA and Supplemental Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA\nSIGNIFICANT EVENTS\nOn May 2, 2016, we completed our acquisition of The ADT Corporation, a leading provider of monitored security and interactive automation solutions in the U.S. and Canada. The ADT Acquisition provided us the ability to continue to expand our market presence in the security industry by leveraging the ADT brand name and other best practices.\nDuring 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to proceeds from borrowings and equity capital contributions, as well as proceeds from the issuance of the Koch Preferred Securities, to fund the ADT Acquisition. The proceeds, as well as repayments of long-term borrowings, were primarily attributable to the amendments and restatements to the First Lien Credit Agreement. Additionally, repayments of long-term borrowings include $260 million of voluntary prepayments of the outstanding principal balance of a second lien term loan, as well as a $22 million paydown of the outstanding balance on a revolving credit facility. We also incurred approximately $104 million in deferred financing costs associated with the long-term borrowings and the issuance of the Koch Preferred Securities and paid $35 million primarily associated with escrow payments to former ASG and Protection One shareholders.\nOther income (expense) is attributable to net foreign currency gains of $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and losses of $16 million for the supplemental pro forma year ended December 31, 2016 related to the conversion of intercompany loans that are denominated in Canadian dollars.\nIn January 2018, we completed our IPO in which we issued and sold 105,000,000 shares of common stock at an initial public offering price of $14.00 per share. Net proceeds from the IPO were $1,406 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and offering expenses.\nMonitoring and related services revenue increased by $1,281 million during 2017. This increase was largely attributable to incremental revenue of approximately $1,168 million in 2017 associated with the ADT Acquisition and the amortization of deferred revenue as a result of the application of purchase accounting in connection with the ADT Acquisition that reduced revenue by $63 million during 2016.\nGoodwill Impairment\nThese decreases were partially offset by costs of approximately $64 million of financing and consent fees incurred in 2017 and increased costs of approximately $35 million related to the amortization of deferred subscriber acquisition costs associated with direct and incremental costs incurred to acquire new customers. The remainder of the increases were primarily due to non-cash asset write-downs related to our strategic investments.\nOn February 21, 2018, we used approximately $649 million of the proceeds from the IPO to redeem $594 million aggregate principal amount of Prime Notes and pay the related call premium.\nSubscriber system assets and any related deferred subscriber acquisition costs resulting from customer acquisitions are accounted for using pools based on the month and year of acquisition. We amortize our pooled subscriber system assets and related deferred subscriber acquisition costs using an accelerated method over the estimated life of the customer relationship, which is 15 years. We periodically perform lifing studies to estimate the expected life of the customer relationship and the attrition pattern of our customers. The lifing studies are based on historical customer terminations and are used to establish the amortization rates of our customer account pools in order to reflect the pattern of future benefit. The results of the lifing studies indicate that we can expect attrition to be the greatest in the initial years of asset life; therefore, an accelerated method best matches the future amortization cost with the estimated revenue stream from these customer pools. In order to align the amortization of subscriber system assets and related deferred costs to the pattern in which their economic benefits are consumed, the accelerated method utilizes an average declining balance rate of approximately 250% and converts to straight-line methodology when the resulting amortization charge is greater than that from the accelerated method, resulting in an average amortization of approximately 55% of the pool within the first five years, 25% within the second five years, and 20% within the final five years.\nWe believe that the presentation of Free Cash Flow is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about our ability to repay debt, make other investments, and pay dividends.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment\nRefer to Note 1 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 for further discussion about recent accounting pronouncements.\n (4) Includes $20 million of Management Consulting Agreement fees during 2017 and supplemental pro forma 2016. Such agreement was terminated in connection with the consummation of the IPO.  Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $176 million as compared to the Supplemental Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the supplemental pro forma year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was driven by an increase in revenue as well as reductions in selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding items outside of our definition of Adjusted EBITDA, which were partially offset by increases in cost of revenue.\nUnaudited Supplemental Pro Forma Results of Operations\n 1(d) To record the following net decrease in depreciation and intangible asset amortization as a result of the purchase price allocation associated with the ADT Acquisition: \nIncome tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $764 million as compared to $119 million for the supplemental pro forma year ended December 31, 2016, resulting in an effective tax rate of 181.3% as compared to an effective tax rate of 29.4% for the respective periods. Refer to the -Income Tax Benefit\u201d section above in Results of Operations\u201d for information on the Tax Reform impact on income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nDuring 2018, Adjusted EBITDA increased by $101 million. This increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue from contractual monthly recurring fees for monitoring and other recurring services, as well as higher revenue on transactions in which security equipment is sold outright to customers partially offset by the associated costs. The remainder of this increase was attributable to a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding items outside of our definition of Adjusted EBITDA.\nWe are a leading provider of monitored security and interactive home and business automation solutions in the U.S. and Canada. Our monitored security and automation offerings involve the installation and monitoring of security and premises automation systems designed to detect intrusion; control access; sense movement, smoke, fire, carbon monoxide, flooding, temperature, and other environmental conditions and hazards; and address personal emergencies such as injuries, medical emergencies, or incapacitation.

Interest payments on our fixed-rate debt are calculated based on the contractual terms. Interest payments on our variable-rate debt, including the effects of our interest rate swaps, are calculated based on a forward LIBOR curve (or floor, whichever is higher) plus the applicable margin in effect as of December 31, 2018. Refer to Note 5 Debt\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 for further discussion. \n (i) the reversal of a purchase accounting adjustment related to the write-down to fair value of deferred revenue associated with services not yet rendered of $63 million that is directly related to the ADT Acquisition, but does not have a continuing impact on the Company; and \nTax Reform was signed into law on December 22, 2017. In response to Tax Reform, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d), which allowed companies to record provisional estimates of the effects of the legislative change, and a one-year measurement period to finalize the accounting of those effects. As of December 31, 2018, we completed the accounting for the tax effects of Tax Reform and recorded no material changes to the provisional estimates recorded in 2017.\nTotal Revenue\nIncome tax benefit was $23 million during 2018, resulting in an effective tax rate for the period of 3.7%. The effective tax rate reflects the reduced federal income tax rate of 21% as a result of Tax Reform, a 10.3% unfavorable impact from permanent non-deductible expenses, primarily associated with the Koch Preferred Securities, a 5.8% unfavorable impact from future non-deductible share-based compensation, a 3.7% unfavorable impact from non-deductible goodwill impairment loss, and a 3.2% unfavorable impact from state legislative changes, offset by a 3.8% favorable impact of tax adjustments related to prior year state returns filed in the first quarter of 2018.\n__________________\nWe make certain investments in our business that are intended to grow our customer base, enhance the overall customer experience, improve the productivity of our field workforce, and support greater efficiency of our back-office systems and our customer care centers.\nOur goal is to extend the concept of security from the physical home or business to cybersecurity and personal on-the-go security and safety. Customers' increasingly mobile and active lifestyles have created new opportunities for us in the fast-growing market for self-monitored and DIY products and services. Our technology also allows us to service our customers via various connected and wearable devices whether they are at home or on-the-go.\nINTRODUCTION\nOther Income (Expense)\naccumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2018, we have completed the accounting for the tax effects of this legislative change, and recorded no material changes to the provisional estimates recorded in 2017.\nDeferred subscriber acquisition revenue is deferred and reported as deferred subscriber acquisition revenue in the Consolidated Balance Sheets upon initiation of a monitoring contract. Deferred subscriber acquisition revenue is amortized in pools into installation and other revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the estimated life of the customer relationship using an accelerated method consistent with the amortization of subscriber system assets and deferred subscriber acquisition costs associated with the transaction.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $350 million during 2017. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to incremental expenses associated with The ADT Corporation business of approximately $324 million. The remainder of the increase, excluding the impact from the incremental expenses associated with The ADT Corporation business, was primarily due to (i) $64 million of financing and consent fees incurred in 2017 and (ii) an increase related to the amortization of deferred subscriber acquisition costs of approximately $25 million. These costs were partially offset by (i) decreases in general and administrative and advertising expenses of $31 million that were primarily the result of synergies associated with the ADT Acquisition and (ii) a decrease in radio conversion costs of $27 million.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt was $4 million and $28 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively, and primarily related to the write-off of debt discount and issuance costs associated with amendments and restatements to our First Lien Credit Agreement, as well as the voluntary paydown of $260 million of the second lien term loan, as defined herein, in July and October 2016.\nThe remainder of the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in contractual monthly recurring fees for monitoring and other recurring services, which resulted from the addition of new customers and improvements in average pricing, partially offset by customer attrition. The improvement in average pricing was driven by the addition of new customers at higher rates, largely due to new subscribers generally selecting higher priced services as compared to our existing customers, as well as price escalations on our existing customer base. These factors also were the primary driver for an increase in RMR to $335 million as of December 31, 2017 from $328 million as of December 31, 2016. Gross customer revenue attrition improved to 13.7% as of December 31, 2017 from 14.8% as of December 31, 2016 as a result of our enhanced focus on high quality customer additions through our disciplined customer selection process.\n (i) decreases in financing and consent fees of $55 million due to fees of $9 million incurred during 2018 in connection with amendments and restatements to the First Lien Credit Agreement as compared to $64 million of fees incurred during 2017 in connection with the payment of the Special Dividend and amendments and restatements to the First Lien Credit Agreement; \n \u25e6 December 3, 2018 - $425 million of borrowings in order to partially fund the Red Hawk Acquisition and to fund the partial redemption of the Prime Notes in February 2019; and \nIncome Tax Benefit\nInterest Expense, net\nAdditionally, upon the occurrence of specified change of control events, we must offer to purchase the Prime Notes and ADT Notes at 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the purchase date.\nWe may redeem the ADT Notes, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus a make-whole premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest as of, but excluding, the redemption date.\nThe amortizable life and method of amortization of our contracts and related customer relationships acquired as part of the Formation Transactions and the ADT Acquisition are based on management estimates about the amounts and timing of expected future revenue from customer accounts and average customer account life as of the Formation Transactions and the ADT Acquisition. The amortizable life and method of amortization of our dealer relationships are based on management estimates about the longevity of the underlying dealer network and the attrition of those respective dealers that existed as of the Formation Transactions and the ADT Acquisition. Contracts and related customer relationships acquired as part of the Red Hawk Acquisition are amortized over a period of 10 to 15 years on a straight-line basis. Other definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over a period of up to 10 years on a straight-line basis.\nDividend Reinvestment Plan and Share Repurchase Program\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nADT Acquisition\n \u2022 The First Lien Credit Agreement includes a first lien revolving credit facility with an aggregate available commitment of up to $350 million through March 16, 2023 ( First Lien Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). As of December 31, 2018, there were no outstanding amounts under the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility.  Borrowings under the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (a) Adjusted LIBOR, or (b) the Base Rate, plus the applicable margin of 2.75% for Adjusted LIBOR loans and 1.75% for Base Rate loans. Additionally, we are required to pay a commitment fee between 0.375% and 0.50% (determined based on a net first lien leverage ratio) with respect to the unused commitments under the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility.\nIn connection with the ADT Acquisition, we entered into supplemental indentures to notes originally issued by The ADT Corporation (collectively, the ADT Notes\u201d) providing for each series of ADT Notes to benefit from (i) guarantees by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries and (ii) first-priority senior security interests, subject to permitted liens, in substantially all of the existing and future assets of our domestic subsidiaries. As a result, these notes remained outstanding and became obligations of ours.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA and Supplemental Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, as applicable, for the periods presented:\nDuring 2017, Adjusted EBITDA increased by $820 million. This increase was primarily due to incremental revenue net of incremental costs associated with The ADT Corporation business. The remainder of this increase was attributable to revenue growth, excluding the impact of purchase accounting, and a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding items outside of our definition of Adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by increase in cost of revenue.\nWe are a highly leveraged company with significant debt service requirements. As of December 31, 2018, we had $363 million in cash and cash equivalents and $350 million available under our revolving credit facility. The carrying value of total debt outstanding was $10,002 million as of December 31, 2018. On February 15, 2019, we entered into an additional first lien revolving credit agreement with an aggregate available commitment of up to $50 million maturing on March 16, 2023.\nDebt Covenants\nOur federal income tax accounts are determined on a consolidated return basis for U.S. entities and on a standalone basis for Canadian entities.\nWe believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain non-cash items and about unusual items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future, as well as other items. Further, we believe Adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful measure of operating profitability because we use it for evaluating our business performance, making budgeting decisions, and comparing our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures.\nNet interest expense was primarily comprised of interest expense on our long-term debt and the dividend obligation associated with the Koch Preferred Securities and decreased by $70 million during 2018. The decrease in net interest expense was primarily driven by a reduction in interest expense of $47 million due to the redemption of $594 million aggregate principal amount of the Prime Notes in February 2018 and a reduction in interest expense of approximately $37 million due to the Koch Redemption in July of 2018. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of approximately $24 million due to an increase in interest rates on our variable-rate debt, including the impact of our interest rate swaps. Refer to the -Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section for further discussion regarding our debt and interest.\na greater impact on the effective tax rate when pre-tax income is lower. Refer to Note 7 Income Taxes\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 for further discussion.\nWe generate revenue primarily through contractual monthly recurring fees received for monitoring and related services provided to customers. In transactions in which we provide monitoring and related services but retain ownership of the security systems, our performance obligations primarily include monitoring, related services (such as maintenance agreements), and a material right associated with the non-refundable fees received in connection with the initiation of a monitoring contract (referred to as deferred subscriber acquisition revenue) that the customer will not need to pay upon a renewal of the contract. The portion of the transaction price associated with monitoring and related services revenue is recognized as those services are provided and is reflected in monitoring and related services revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nOn December 3, 2018, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Red Hawk Fire & Security, a leader in commercial fire, life safety, and security services, for total consideration of $318 million and cash paid of $301 million, net of cash acquired ( Red Hawk Acquisition\u201d). We funded the Red Hawk Acquisition from a combination of additional debt financing and cash on hand. This acquisition is intended to accelerate our growth in the commercial security market and expand our product portfolio with the introduction of commercial fire safety related solutions.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to select accounting policies and make estimates that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. Management's estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or market conditions. The following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for 2016 resulted from $620 million of net income, exclusive of depreciation and intangible assets amortization and other non-cash items, and reflects: (i) cash interest paid of $431 million, (ii) transaction costs of $347 million associated with the ADT Acquisition, (iii) cash paid of $29 million for fees in connection with amendments and restatements to the First Lien Credit Agreement, (iv) cash paid for radio conversion costs of $43 million, (v) restructuring payments of $52 million primarily associated with the ADT Acquisition, (iv) other cash payments of $28 million that are primarily related to integration costs of $13 million, management consulting fees of $13 million, and $2 million of other items. The remainder relates to changes in assets and liabilities due to the volume and timing of other operating cash receipts and payments.\nIn evaluating our results, we utilize key performance indicators which include non-GAAP measures as well as the operating metrics of gross revenue attrition, unit and customer count, RMR, RMR additions and revenue payback. Our computations of key performance indicators may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Additionally, our operating metric key performance indicators are approximated as there may be variations to reported results in each period due to certain adjustments we might make in connection with the integration over several periods of acquired companies that calculated these metrics differently, or otherwise, including periodic reassessments and refinements in the ordinary course of business. These refinements, for example, may include changes due to systems conversion or historical methodology differences in legacy systems.", "item_7_text": "As part of our annual goodwill impairment tests during the fourth quarter of 2018, we determined that our goodwill related to the Canada reporting unit was impaired, which was primarily driven by the underperformance of the Canada reporting unit relative to expectations. Accordingly, we recorded a goodwill impairment loss of $88 million. We did not record a goodwill impairment loss in 2017.\nThe effective tax rates for 2017 and 2016 reflect the tax impact of permanent tax adjustments, state tax expense, changes in tax laws, and non-U.S. net earnings. The effective tax rate can vary from period to period due to permanent tax adjustments, discrete items such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, recurring factors such as changes in the overall effective state tax rate, as well as fluctuations in pre-tax income or loss.

We currently provide services to approximately 4 million customer sites that use 3G or CDMA cellular equipment, which number is diminishing on a monthly basis in the ordinary course of business due to attrition, upgrades and repairs. Our plans to address this three-year transition are not yet finalized and the impact involves numerous estimates and variables. Among other factors, we will look to reduce any applicable costs to the Company, such as hardware costs currently estimated to be less than $90 per site, by exploring cost sharing opportunities, working with our suppliers, carriers and customers, and to increase revenue by using the transition as an opportunity to sell new products and services in conjunction with replacing the radio and to more rapidly transition customers to our new Command and Control technology.\nDuring 2018, cash flows used in investing activities increased by approximately $325 million compared to 2017 due to the following: (i) an increase in cash used for business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $289 million primarily due to the Red Hawk Acquisition in 2018; and (ii) an increase in dealer generated customer accounts and bulk account purchases of $40 million due to an increase in volume purchased and average cost.\nInitial Public Offering\nTax Reform was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The legislation, among other things, reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, imposed a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, imposed significant limitations on the deductibility of interest, allowed for the full expensing of capital expenditures, and put into effect the migration from a worldwide\u201d system of taxation to a modified territorial system. In response to Tax Reform, SAB 118 allowed companies to record provisional estimates of the effects of the legislative change, and a one-year measurement period to finalize the accounting of those effects. As of December 31, 2017, we had not finalized our analysis of the implications of this legislative change; however, our net deferred tax assets and liabilities were revalued at the newly enacted U.S. corporate rate, and provisional amounts associated with the legislative changes were recognized in our tax benefit in 2017. The total provisional amount recorded as of December 31, 2017 was $690 million and included a remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as the impact of the mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2018, we completed the accounting for the tax effects of Tax Reform and recorded no material changes to the provisional estimates recorded in the 2017 financial statements.\nThe First Lien Credit Agreement and indentures associated with the borrowings above contain certain covenants and restrictions that limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt or issue certain preferred equity interests; create liens on certain assets; make certain loans or investments (including acquisitions); pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of the capital stock or make other restricted payments; consolidate, merge, sell, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; sell assets; enter into certain transactions with affiliates; enter into sale-leaseback transactions; restrict dividends from our subsidiaries or restrict liens; change our fiscal year; and modify the terms of certain debt or organizational agreements.\nOur board of directors declared the following cash dividends on our common stock in 2018:\nInterest Expense, net\n (i) equity proceeds of $3,571 million, net of issuance costs, which resulted from equity issuances by us and Ultimate Parent to our Sponsor and certain other investors; \n (ii) decreases in management consulting agreement fees of $19 million, which was terminated upon consummation of the IPO; and \nAs of December 31, 2018, our guarantees totaled $54 million and primarily related to standby letters of credit on our insurance programs. We do not have any other material off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.\nADT Notes\n2017 Compared to 2016\nConcurrently with the consummation of the Formation Transactions, we entered into a first lien credit agreement, which has since been amended and restated on May 2, 2016, June 23, 2016, December 28, 2016, February 13, 2017, June 29, 2017, March 16, 2018, and December 3, 2018 (together with these subsequent amendments and restatements, the First Lien Credit Agreement\u201d). The First Lien Credit Agreement consists of the following:\nWe believe this section provides additional information to investors about our financial performance in a manner consistent with how management views our performance. The presentation of unaudited supplemental pro forma results is for informational purposes only, and is prepared on a basis consistent with Article 11 of Regulation S-X, however, it does not constitute Article 11 pro forma financial information since the unaudited supplemental pro forma year ended December 31, 2016 presented herein reflect the ADT Acquisition and the Formation Transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2015, to the extent they have not been fully reflected in our historical consolidated financial statements included elsewhere.\n (1) Refer to the -Key Performance Indicators\u201d section for the definitions of these key performance indicators. \nBusiness Combinations\nMerger, restructuring, integration, and other decreased $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the supplemental pro forma year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in merger, restructuring, integration, and other was primarily related to a decrease in restructuring charges of $35 million primarily related to the severance of certain former executives and employees of The ADT Corporation in connection with the ADT Acquisition included in the supplemental pro forma year ended December 31, 2016, which did not recur in 2017. These charges were partially offset by an increase in integration costs, as well as impairment charges primarily related to our strategic investments.\nWe account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business acquisitions are recorded at the date of acquisition at their estimated fair values, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and in assigning their respective useful lives. Accordingly, we may engage third-party valuation specialists to assist in these determinations. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain.\nFree Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure that our management employs to measure cash that is available to repay debt, make other investments, and pay dividends. Our definition of Free Cash Flow, a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to net cash provided by operating activities (the most comparable GAAP measure), and additional information, including a description of the limitations relating to the use of Free Cash Flow, are provided under -Non-GAAP Measures.\u201d\n\nWe report financial and operating information in one segment. Our operating segment is also our reportable segment. We have presented results of operations, including the related discussion and analysis, for the following periods: (i) year ended December 31, 2018 compared to year ended December 31, 2017, and (ii) year ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2016.\nDuring 2018, net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to net proceeds from the IPO of $1,406 million, after deducting related fees, offset by net repayments on our long-term borrowings of $1,130 million and dividend payments on our common stock of $79 million. The net repayments on our long-term borrowings include the redemption of the Koch Preferred Securities of $853 million and the repayment of long-term borrowings of $700 million primarily due to the partial redemption of the Prime Notes, offset by net proceeds of $423 million from additional long-term borrowings.\n \u25e6 July 1, 2015 - $1,095 million of borrowings in connection with the Formation Transactions; \nACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n (3) Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP measures. Refer to the -Non-GAAP Measures\u201d section for the definitions of these terms and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures. \n (5) Represents contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services, including purchase orders, related to agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction as of December 31, 2018. Refer to Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 for further discussion.  We have not included in the contractual obligations table approximately $80 million of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, relating to various tax positions we have taken. These liabilities may increase or decrease over time primarily as a result of tax examinations, and given the status of the examinations, we cannot reliably estimate the period of any cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Refer to Note 7 Income Taxes\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 for further discussion. In addition, we have not included the minimum required contributions to our defined benefit\nLoss Contingencies\nOther Income (Expense)\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nOn February 21, 2018, we used approximately $649 million of the proceeds from the IPO to redeem $594 million aggregate principal amount of the Prime Notes and pay the related call premium.\nInstallation and other revenue increased by $85 million during 2017. This increase primarily resulted from $49 million related to revenue from security equipment sold outright to customers in 2017, which includes approximately $10 million of incremental revenue associated with the operations of The ADT Corporation. Additionally, the increase in installation and other revenue includes $36 million of revenue related to the amortization of deferred installation revenue, which includes approximately $11 million of incremental deferred installation revenue associated with the operations of The ADT Corporation during 2017.\nplans as the aggregate contributions are not material. Refer to Note 11 Retirements Plans\u201d in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 for further discussion.\nMerger, restructuring, integration, and other decreased by $329 million during 2017. This decrease was primarily due to merger costs of $311 million associated with the ADT Acquisition incurred during 2016 and a decrease in restructuring charges of $33 million due to charges incurred in 2016 primarily related to the severance of certain former executives and employees of The ADT Corporation in connection with the ADT Acquisition. These charges were partially offset by an increase in integration expenses primarily associated with the integration of The ADT Corporation business, as well as an increase in impairment charges related to our strategic investments.\nDuring 2018, we declared dividends of $107 million (or $0.14 per share), of which $79 million was paid. During 2017, we declared and paid $750 million (or $1.17 per share) related to the Special Dividend. There were no dividends declared or paid in 2016.\nDuring 2017, net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to dividend payments of $750 million, offset by net proceeds from long-term borrowings of $619 million. The net proceeds from long-term borrowings includes $800 million from additional long-term borrowings, partially offset by repayments of $140 million under our revolving credit facility, principal paydowns of $27 million, and capital lease payments of $14 million.\nAs of January 1, 2018, due to the cumulative impact of adopting this new standard, we recorded a net increase to the opening balance of stockholders' equity of $34 million, which is net of tax of $12 million.\nAdditionally, we have presented notes to our unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information that describe the supplemental pro forma adjustments and their underlying assumptions. The unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information set forth below is based upon available information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable. The historical financial information has been adjusted to give effect to supplemental pro forma events that are: (1) directly attributable to the ADT Acquisition and the Formation Transactions; (2) factually supportable; and (3) with respect to the statements of operations, expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results. The unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information is for illustrative and informational purposes only and is not intended to represent or be indicative of our financial condition or results of operations had the above transactions occurred on the date indicated. The unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information also should not be considered representative of our future financial condition or results of operations.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Supplemental Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to net loss for the supplemental pro forma year ended December 31, 2016.\n 1(b) Reflects the impact of: \nLiquidity\nCustomer billings for services not yet rendered are deferred and recognized as revenue as services are provided. These fees are recorded as current deferred revenue in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as we expect to satisfy any remaining performance obligations, as well as recognize the related revenue, within the next twelve months. Accordingly, we have applied the practical expedient regarding deferred revenue to exclude the value of remaining performance obligations if (i) the contract has an original expected term of one year or less or (ii) we recognize revenue in proportion to the amount it has the right to invoice for services performed.\nMerger, restructuring, integration, and other decreased by $68 million during 2018. This decrease was primarily due to the following: (i) a gain on fair value remeasurement of approximately $11 million on a strategic investment during 2018 compared to impairment charges of approximately $18 million on strategic investments during 2017; (ii) an $18 million decrease in restructuring efforts; and (iii) a $14 million decrease related to integration costs associated with acquisitions.\nOn July 2, 2018, we redeemed the original stated value of $750 million of the Koch Preferred Securities for total consideration of approximately $949 million using proceeds from the IPO and cash on hand. The total consideration paid includes approximately $103 million related to the redemption premium and tax reimbursements, as well as $96 million related to the accumulated dividend obligation on the Koch Preferred Securities. We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $213 million as a result of the redemption. The remaining proceeds from the IPO were used to pay IPO related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes.\nincrease in dealer generated customer accounts and bulk account purchases, subscriber system asset additions, and capital expenditures is due to incremental volume as a result of the timing of the ADT Acquisition in 2016. Additionally, we received net proceeds of $42 million from the termination of derivative financial instruments related to the ADT Acquisition during 2016.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt was $4 million and $28 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 and the supplemental pro forma year ended December 31, 2016, respectively, and related to amendments and restatements to the First Lien Credit Agreement in 2017, and the write-off of debt discount and issuance costs associated with the voluntary paydown of $260 million of a second lien term loans in July and October 2016 and the amendments and restatements to the First Lien Credit Agreement in 2016.\nDuring 2017, cash flows provided by operating activities increased by approximately $974 million compared to 2016 based on the activity described below.\nFree Cash Flow\n (ii) incremental first lien term loan borrowings of $1,555 million and the issuance of $3,140 million of the Prime Notes; and \n 1(c) Reflects the impact of: \n\nN/A-Not applicable\nThe table below reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to net (loss) income for the periods presented.\n 1(f) To record incremental interest expense (including related amortization of debt issuance costs and discount) of $168 million associated with borrowings to fund the ADT Acquisition as a result of: (1) the incremental first lien term loan facility of $1,555 million; (2) the issuance of $3,140 million of Prime Notes; (3) the amortization of issuance costs and fees associated with a $255 million revolving credit facility; (4) the Koch Preferred Securities, which have an aggregate stated value of $750 million (dividends for the Koch Preferred Securities are recorded as interest expense); and (5) the amortization of the fair value adjustment made to the ADT Notes assumed as a result of the acquisition. These increases are net of the removal of interest expense of $11 million on The ADT Corporation debt repaid (including related amortization of capitalized debt acquisition costs) in connection with the consummation of the acquisition. \nNON-GAAP MEASURES\n\nGross customer revenue attrition is calculated on a trailing twelve-month basis, the numerator of which is the annualized RMR lost during the period due to attrition, net of dealer charge-backs and reinstated customers, excluding contracts monitored but not owned, and the denominator of which is total annualized RMR based on an average of RMR under contract at the beginning of each month during the period.\n (iii) favorable legal settlements of $17.5 million due to two settlements during 2018.  Depreciation and Intangible Asset Amortization\n2018 Compared to 2017\nTax Reform was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The legislation, among other things, reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, imposed a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, imposed significant limitations on the deductibility of interest, allowed for the full expensing of capital expenditures, and put into effect the migration from a worldwide\u201d system of taxation to a modified territorial system. In response to Tax Reform, the SEC issued SAB 118 that allowed companies to record provisional estimates of the effects of the legislative change, and a one-year measurement period to finalize the accounting of those effects. The total provisional amount recorded in 2017 was $690 million and included a remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as the impact of the mandatory one-time tax on\nThe monthly fees that we generate from any individual customer vary based on the level of service we provide to the customer and customer tenure. We offer a wide range of services at various price points from basic burglar alarm monitoring to our full suite of interactive services. Our ability to increase monthly fees at the individual customer level depends on a number of factors, including our ability to effectively introduce and market additional features and services that increase the value of our offerings to customers, which we believe drives customers to purchase higher levels of service and supports our ability to make periodic adjustments to pricing.\nASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and related amendments, establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. We adopted this new standard and its related amendments effective on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method, whereby the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard is recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of stockholders' equity. Results for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 are presented under this new standard, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for the prior period.\nMerger, Restructuring, Integration, and Other\nSubscriber System Assets, net and Deferred Subscriber Acquisition Costs, net\nrate calculated as, at our option, either (a) LIBOR determined by reference to the costs of funds for Eurodollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing, adjusted for certain additional costs ( Adjusted LIBOR\u201d) with a floor of 1.00%, or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% per annum, (ii) the prime rate published by The Wall Street Journal, and (iii) one-month adjusted LIBOR plus 1.00% per annum ( Base Rate\u201d), in each case, plus the applicable margin of 2.75% for Adjusted LIBOR loans and 1.75% for Base Rate loans. We have interest rate swap contracts with the objective of managing exposure to variability in interest rates on our debt.\nOVERVIEW\nIn addition, we offer professional monitoring of third-party devices by enabling other companies to integrate solutions into our monitoring and billing platform. This allows us to provide monitoring solutions to customers who do not currently have an installed ADT security system or interactive automation platform.\n\nPrime Notes\nFree Cash Flow\n_______________________\nLong-Term Debt\nDepreciation and Intangible Asset Amortization\nBASIS OF PRESENTATION\nFACTORS AFFECTING OPERATING RESULTS\n\n (3) Represents adjustments related to the fair value of deferred revenue under GAAP, primarily related to the ADT Acquisition in 2016 and the Red Hawk Acquisition in 2018. \nprimarily associated with the Protection One trade name, which we began amortizing in July 2016, and (iii) amortization of software license expenses of $37 million related to the cloud computing accounting standard.\nMerger, Restructuring, Integration, and Other\nDepreciation and intangible asset amortization increased by $630 million during 2017. This increase primarily related to depreciation and intangible asset amortization associated with the fair value of assets acquired in the ADT Acquisition, which primarily includes amortization of definite-lived intangible assets and depreciation of subscriber system assets. Additionally, the increase in depreciation and intangible asset amortization was also attributable to (i) an increase in amortization of customer contracts acquired under the ADT Authorized Dealer Program of $104 million, (ii) an increase in amortization of $42 million\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Prime Notes have an outstanding balance of $2,546 million. which represents the following events:\nCost of revenue increased by $146 million during 2018. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to $118 million from installation costs associated with a higher volume of sales where security-related equipment is sold outright to customers, the majority of which is due to the incremental volume associated with acquisitions. The remaining increase is due to an increase in our field and maintenance service expenses, of which approximately $15 million is related to incremental expenses associated with acquisitions.\n (iii) issuance by ADT Inc. of 750,000 shares of the Koch Preferred Securities and issuance by Ultimate Parent of the Warrants to the Koch Investor for an aggregate amount of $750 million. \nWe expect our ongoing sources of liquidity to include cash generated from operations, as well as borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the issuance of equity and/or debt securities as appropriate given market conditions. Our future cash needs are expected to include cash for operating activities, working capital, capital expenditures, strategic investments, periodic principal and interest payments on our debt, and potential dividend payments to our stockholders. We may, from time to time, seek to repay, redeem, repurchase, or refinance our indebtedness, or seek to retire or purchase our outstanding securities through cash purchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions or through a 10b5-1 repurchase plan or otherwise, and any such transactions may involve material amounts. We believe our cash position, borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facilities, and cash provided by operating activities are, and will continue to be, adequate to meet our operational and business needs in the next twelve months as well as our long-term liquidity needs.\nInitial Public Offering\n___________________\nCost of revenue increased $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the supplemental pro forma year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cost of revenue was attributable to increased costs of approximately $25 million related to installation costs associated with a higher volume of sales where security-related equipment is sold outright to customers and approximately $23 million in field and maintenance service expenses incurred to enhance service levels and lower customer backlog. These were partially offset by decreased customer care expenses of approximately $22 million, which consisted of reduced software license expenses related to a newly adopted cloud computing accounting standard, partially offset by investments in customer care associated with enhanced customer revenue attrition improvement initiatives.\nIn January 2018, in connection with the consummation of our IPO, we received net proceeds of $1,406 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and offering expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA\n (i) the elimination of The ADT Corporation historical amortization of deferred subscriber acquisition costs of $52 million as a result of the purchase price allocation for the ADT Acquisition as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2015 because the application of this purchase accounting adjustment has a continuing impact on the Company; and \n \u2022 May 2, 2016 - $3,140 million of borrowings in connection with the ADT Acquisition; and \n_____________________\nIncome tax benefit was $764 million in 2017, resulting in an effective tax rate for the period of 181.3%. The effective tax rate primarily reflects the favorable impact of Tax Reform offset by the unfavorable impact of permanent tax adjustments.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nEffective March 11, 2019, we declared a cash dividend on our common stock of $0.035 per share payable to common stockholders of record on April 2, 2019. This dividend will be paid on April 12, 2019.\n (2) Refer to the Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations-Key Performance Indicators\u201d section for the definitions of these key performance indicators. \n \u2022 Prior to May 15, 2019, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, (a) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Prime Notes redeemed, plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest as of, but excluding, the redemption date or (b) for up to 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Prime Notes and in an aggregate amount equal to the net cash proceeds of any equity offerings, at a redemption price equal to 109.250%, plus accrued and unpaid interest, so long as at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Prime Notes shall remain outstanding after each such redemption. \nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nLong-Lived Asset Impairments\nTotal consideration in connection with the ADT Acquisition was $12,114 million, which included the assumption of The ADT Corporation's outstanding debt (inclusive of capital lease obligations) at a fair value of $3,551 million on the acquisition date, and cash of approximately $54 million.\n \u25e6 Reduced by regularly scheduled quarterly principal payments.  The First Lien Term B-1 Loan requires scheduled quarterly payments equal to 0.25% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount, or approximately $10 million per quarter, with the remaining balance payable at maturity. In addition, we are required to make annual prepayments on the outstanding First Lien Term B-1 Loan with a percentage of our excess cash flow, as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement, if our excess cash flow exceeds a certain specified threshold. We are not currently required to make any annual prepayments based on our excess cash flow. We may make voluntarily prepayments on the First Lien Term B-1 Loan at any time prior to maturity at par. The First Lien Term B-1 Loan has a variable interest\n (3) Represents the minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2018. Some agreements have renewal options. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating leases. Refer to Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 for further discussion. \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAs of December 31, 2018, we have the following outstanding debt balances (excluding capital leases, deferred financing costs, discount, and fair value adjustments):\nDuring 2017, other income primarily includes $24 million of foreign currency gains related to the conversion of intercompany loans that are denominated in Canadian dollars. During the first quarter of 2018, we designated certain of these intercompany loans to be of a long-term-investment nature and began recognizing the related foreign currency gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nWe recognize positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return in the financial statements when it is more likely than-not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50%) that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. A recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit with greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We record liabilities for positions that have been taken but do not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold. We adjust the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a change to the estimated income taxes.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for 2017 resulted from $1,550 million of net income, exclusive of depreciation and intangible assets amortization and other non-cash items, and reflects: (i) cash interest paid of $661 million, (ii) cash paid of $64 million for fees associated with the Special Dividend and fees in connection with amendments and restatements to the First Lien Credit Agreement, (iii) restructuring payments of $25 million and integration payments of $21 million primarily associated with the ADT Acquisition, (iv) cash paid for fees under the Management Consulting Agreement of $20 million, (v) cash paid for radio conversion costs of $13 million, and (vi) other cash payments of $10 million. The remainder relates to changes in assets and liabilities due to the volume and timing of other operating cash receipts and payments.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the supplemental pro forma year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease primarily relates to decreases in radio conversion costs of $56 million related to a program that began in 2015 to upgrade cellular technology used in many of our security systems and decreases related to reductions in costs as a result of the integration of The ADT Corporation business, including (i) general and administrative expenses of approximately $37 million, (ii) advertising costs of approximately $33 million, and (iii) selling and marketing costs of approximately $27 million.\n 1(e) To remove transaction costs associated with the ADT Acquisition, as these costs will not have a continuing impact on the Company's results. \nDuring 2017, cash flows used in investing activities decreased by approximately $7,998 million compared to 2016 due to the following: (i) a decrease in cash used for business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $8,438 million due to the ADT Acquisition in 2016; (ii) an increase in dealer generated customer accounts and bulk account purchases of $246 million; (iii) an increase in subscriber system asset additions of $114 million; and (iv) an increase in capital expenditures of $52 million. The\nAdjusted EBITDA\n1. Unaudited Supplemental Pro Forma Statement of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2016 \nGoodwill\nThere are material limitations to using Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account certain significant items, including depreciation and amortization, interest, taxes, and other adjustments which directly affect our net income or loss. These limitations are best addressed by considering the economic effects of the excluded items independently and by considering Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA may be presented on a supplemental pro forma basis. Refer to the -Supplemental Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d section for further discussion regarding the presentation of supplemental pro forma financial information.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nUnder a quantitative approach, we estimate the fair value of the asset and compare it to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is determined based on the nature of the underlying asset. Our only indefinite-lived intangible asset is the ADT trade name. The fair value of the ADT trade name is determined under a relief from royalty method, which is an income approach that estimates the cost savings that accrue to us that we would otherwise have to pay in the form of royalties or license fees on revenue earned through the use of the asset. The utilization of the relief from royalty method requires us to make significant assumptions including revenue growth rates, the implied royalty rate, and the discount rate.\n \u25e6 May 2, 2016 - $1,555 million of borrowings in connection with the ADT Acquisition; \nAs of December 31, 2018, our guarantees totaled $54 million and primarily related to standby letters of credit on our insurance programs.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nRefer to the discussions above under -Results of Operations\u201d for further details.\nPurchases of contracts with customers under the ADT Authorized Dealer Program, or from other third parties, are accounted for using pools based on the month and year of acquisition. We amortize our pooled contracts with customers using an accelerated method over the estimated life of the customer relationship, which is 15 years. The accelerated method for amortizing these\n (2) Gross customer revenue attrition for 2016 is presented on a pro forma basis for The ADT Corporation business. \nWe define Free Cash Flow as cash flows from operating activities less cash outlays related to capital expenditures. We define capital expenditures to include purchases of property, plant, and equipment; subscriber system asset additions and deferred subscriber installation costs; and accounts purchased through our network of authorized dealers or third parties outside of our authorized dealer network. These items are subtracted from cash flows from operating activities because they represent long-term investments that are required for normal business activities.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nDuring the first quarter of 2018 and in connection with the IPO, we redeemed Class B Units in Ultimate Parent in full for the number of shares of our common stock ( Distributed Shares\u201d) that would have been distributed to such holder under the terms of Ultimate Parent's operating agreement in a hypothetical liquidation on the date of the IPO at the initial public offering price ( Class B Unit Redemption\u201d), which resulted in a modification of both the shares subject to time-based vesting ( Distributed Shares Service Tranche\u201d) and shares subject to vesting based upon the achievement of certain investment return thresholds by Apollo ( Distributed Shares Performance Tranche\u201d). The modification of the Distributed Shares Performance Tranche resulted in a significant increase in fair value, whereas the impact of the modification on the Distributed Shares Service Tranche was not material. Additionally, upon consummation of the IPO, we approved our 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan ( 2018 Plan\u201d). Under the 2018 Plan, and in connection with the Class B Unit Redemption, we also granted options to holders of Class B Units ( Top-up Options\u201d). The Class B Unit Redemption and Top-up Options resulted in the increase in share-based compensation expense during 2018.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that we believe is useful to investors to measure the operational strength and performance of our business. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA, a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) (the most comparable GAAP measure), and additional information, including a description of the limitations relating to the use of Adjusted EBITDA, are provided under -Non-GAAP Measures.\u201d In addition, Adjusted EBITDA may be presented on a supplemental pro forma basis. Refer to the -Supplemental Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d section for further discussion regarding the presentation of supplemental pro forma financial information.\n 1(a) The ADT Corporation's historical combined statement of operations data for the period January 1, 2016 to May 1, 2016 has been derived by adding the historical consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and the historical consolidated statement of operations data for the period April 1, 2016 to May 1, 2016. Certain expenses have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. \nWe have presented below the financial information and operating results for the year ended December 31, 2017 on a historical basis compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 on a supplemental pro forma basis.\nInstallation and other revenue increased by $186 million during 2018. This increase was primarily due to $153 million related to revenue from security equipment sold outright to customers, of which approximately $99 million related to incremental revenue associated with acquisitions. The remaining increase of $33 million was due to additional amortization of deferred subscriber acquisition revenue during 2018.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nCost of Revenue\nFirst Lien Credit Agreement\n (2) Relates to the conversion of intercompany loans that are denominated in Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars. \nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe increase in monitoring and related services was primarily attributable to an increase in contractual monthly recurring fees for monitoring and other recurring services, which resulted from the addition of new customers and improvements in average pricing, partially offset by customer attrition. The improvement in average pricing was driven by the addition of new customers at higher rates, largely due to new subscribers generally selecting higher priced services as compared to our existing customers, as well as price escalations on our existing customer base. These factors also were the primary driver for an increase in RMR to $335 million as of December 31, 2017 from $328 million as of December 31, 2016. Gross customer revenue attrition improved to 13.7% as of December 31, 2017 from 14.8% as of December 31, 2016 as a result of our enhanced focus on high quality customer additions through our disciplined customer selection process.\nIncome Taxes\nAll financial information presented in this section has been prepared in U.S. dollars in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) and include the accounts of ADT Inc. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.\n 1(g) To record the income tax expense impact of the supplemental pro forma adjustments at the blended statutory rate of 38.4%.  Components of Unaudited Supplemental Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA\nTotal revenue increased $149 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the supplemental pro forma year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was a result of an increase in monitoring and related services of $75 million and an increase in installation and other revenue of $74 million.\n \u25e6 June 23, 2016 - $125 million of borrowings in order to payoff and terminate a second lien term loan; \nEarly termination of the contract by the customer results in a termination charge in accordance with the contract terms. Contract termination charges are recognized in monitoring and related services revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations when collectability is probable. Amounts collected from customers for sales and other taxes are reported net of the related amounts remitted.\nOur principal liquidity requirements are to finance current operations, investments in internally generated subscriber system assets and dealer generated customer accounts, expenditures for property and equipment, debt service requirements, and potential mergers and acquisitions. Our liquidity requirements are primarily funded by our cash flows from operations, which include cash received from monthly recurring revenue and upfront fees received from customers, less cash costs to provide services to our customers, including general and administrative costs, certain costs associated with acquiring new customers, and interest payments.\n (ii) As of the acquisition date, subscriber system assets have a weighted-average remaining useful life of approximately 7 years and are depreciated on an accelerated basis. Property and equipment has a remaining average life of 3 years and are depreciated on a straight-line basis. \nCost of revenue increased by $202 million during 2017. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to (i) an increase in field and maintenance service expenses of $89 million primarily associated with the operations of The ADT Corporation, including expenses incurred for service calls for customers who have maintenance contracts, and (ii) an increase in customer care expenses of $75 million primarily attributable to costs associated with the operations of The ADT Corporation, as well as investments associated with enhanced customer revenue attrition improvement initiatives, which was partially offset by reduced software license expenses related to a cloud computing accounting standard adopted in 2016. The remainder of the increase in cost of revenue was due to increased installation costs of approximately $38 million associated with a higher volume of sales where security-related equipment is sold outright to customers.\nRefer to the discussion below under -Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for further details regarding cash flows from operating activities.\nAttrition has a direct impact on the number of customers we monitor and service, as well as our financial results, including revenue, operating income, and cash flows. A portion of our customer base can be expected to cancel its service every year. Customers may choose not to renew or may terminate their contracts for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, relocation, cost, loss to competition, or service issues.\nThe following table provides a summary of our commitments and contractual obligations for debt, leases, and other purchase obligations as of December 31, 2018.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nWe review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be fully recoverable. We group assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identified. Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying value of the asset group to its expected future undiscounted cash flows. If the expected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value, less the cost to sell, of the asset group. The calculation of the fair value, less cost to sell, of an asset group is based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk.\nRefer to the discussions above under -Results of Operations\u201d for further details.\nThe table below reconciles Free Cash Flow to cash flows from operating activities for the periods presented.\nWe capitalize certain costs associated with transactions in which we retain ownership of the security system as well as incremental selling expenses related to acquiring customers. These costs include equipment, installation costs, and other incremental costs. Subscriber system assets represent capitalized equipment and installation costs incurred in connection with transactions in which we retain ownership of the security system. Upon customer termination, we may retrieve such assets. These assets have a probable future economic benefit for us as they contribute to the generation of future monitoring and related services revenue for us. Deferred subscriber acquisition costs, net represent incremental selling expenses (primarily commissions) related to acquiring customers.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nAs of December 31, 2018, we have approximately $200 million of goodwill allocated to our Canada reporting unit, which reflects a goodwill impairment loss of $88 million recorded due to its underperformance in 2018. During the fourth quarter there were changes to the Canadian leadership team and also revisions to our outlook for the reporting unit completed as part of our annual budgeting process. As a result of the goodwill impairment loss, the carrying value of the Canada reporting unit approximates its fair value, and as such, is considered at risk of future impairment. If our assumptions are not realized, or if there are changes in any of the assumptions in the future due to a change in economic conditions, it is possible that an impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future. Our other reporting units are not considered at risk due to the excess of their fair values over their carrying values. Refer to Note 4 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 for further discussion.\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations, summary cash flow data, and key performance indicators for the periods presented.\nIncome Tax Benefit\n (4) Represents the principal and interest payments on our capital lease obligations as of December 31, 2018. Refer to Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 for further discussion. \nOther Income (Expense)\nRadio Conversion Costs\nKEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\nDefinite-lived intangible assets primarily include contracts and related customer and dealer relationships that originated from the Formation Transactions and the ADT Acquisition as well as contracts with customers purchased under the ADT Authorized Dealer Program, or from other third parties.\nThe increase in installation and other revenue was due to (i) approximately $38 million related to revenue from security equipment sold outright to customers and (ii) approximately $36 million of additional revenue generated from new customer additions associated with the amortization of deferred installation revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the supplemental pro forma year ended December 31, 2016.\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. In determining taxable income for our consolidated financial statements, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. We record the effect of a tax rate or law change on our deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period of enactment. Future tax rate or law changes could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.\n___________________________\nNet interest expense was primarily comprised of interest expense on our long-term debt and the dividend obligation associated with the Koch Preferred Securities and increased by $211 million during 2017. The increase in interest expense was primarily the result of an increase in borrowings to fund the ADT Acquisition, including the dividend obligation associated with the Koch Preferred Securities. Refer to the -Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section for further discussion regarding our debt and interest.\nFor further details on the drivers of these changes, refer to the discussions above.\nUnder a qualitative approach, the impairment review for an indefinite-lived intangible asset consists of an assessment of whether it is more-likely-than-not that an asset's fair value is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset, or if a qualitative assessment indicates it is more-likely-than-not that the estimated carrying value of such asset exceeds its fair value, we proceed to a quantitative approach.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss adjusted for (i) interest, (ii) taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, including depreciation of subscriber system assets and other fixed assets and amortization of dealer and other intangible assets, (iv) amortization of deferred costs and deferred revenue associated with subscriber acquisitions, (v) share-based compensation expense, (vi) purchase accounting adjustments under GAAP, (vii) merger, restructuring, integration, and other, (viii) goodwill impairment losses, (ix) financing and consent fees, (x) foreign currency gains/losses, (xi) losses on extinguishment of debt, (xii) radio conversion costs, (xiii) management fees and other charges, and (xiv) other non-cash items.\nGross Customer Revenue Attrition\nCash Outlays Related to Capital Expenditures\n (4) Represents costs associated with upgrading cellular technology used in many of our security systems. \nThe unaudited supplemental pro forma year ended December 31, 2016 has been derived from (i) the Company's historical consolidated financial information for the year ended December 31, 2016 included in this document, (ii) The ADT Corporation's historical condensed consolidated financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2016, and (iii) The ADT Corporation's historical condensed consolidated financial information for the period April 1, 2016 to May 1, 2016, as illustrated in the table below:\nIncome tax benefit was $266 million during 2016, resulting in an effective tax rate for the period of 33.2%. The effective tax rate for 2016 primarily reflects the impact of permanent tax adjustments mainly related to non-deductible acquisition costs associated with the ADT Acquisition.\nNet interest expense decreased $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the supplemental pro forma year ended December 31, 2016. Net interest expense is primarily comprised of interest expense on our long-term debt. The decrease in interest expense is primarily related to the voluntary paydown of $260 million of a second lien term loan in July and October 2016.\nWe record accruals for losses that we believe are probable to occur and are reasonably estimable. These accruals are based on judgment, the probability of losses, and where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates. Legal costs in connection with claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business are expensed as incurred. Additionally, we record insurance recovery receivables from third-party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable.\nFree Cash Flow\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nSUPPLEMENTAL MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\n (1) In 2017, relates to fees incurred in connection with the Special Dividend and amendments and restatements related to the First Lien Credit Agreement. \nAs of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all financial covenant and other maintenance tests for all our debt obligations.\nDividends\n (3) Adjusted EBITDA and Supplemental Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. Refer to the Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Non-GAAP Measures\u201d section for the definitions thereof and below for reconciliations to net income (loss), the most comparable GAAP measure, as well as the equivalent reconciliations on a supplemental pro forma basis.  Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Unaudited Supplemental Pro Forma Year Ended December 31, 2016\nAs of December 31, 2018, we serve approximately 7.2 million recurring customers, excluding contracts monitored but not owned. We are one of the largest full-service companies with a national footprint providing both residential and commercial monitored security. We deliver an integrated customer experience by maintaining the industry's largest sales, installation, and service field force, as well as a 24/7 professional monitoring network.\nWe funded the ADT Acquisition, as well as related transaction costs, using the net proceeds from a combination of the following:\nDefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\n (1) Refer to Note 1 to Notes to the Unaudited Supplemental Pro Forma Financial Information presented in the Supplemental Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \nOther income (expense) was primarily attributable to net foreign currency gains of $24 million and losses of $16 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to the conversion of intercompany loans that are denominated in Canadian dollars. Other expense during 2016 also includes a net loss on the settlement of derivative contracts that were executed to hedge future cash flows associated with the ADT Acquisition.\nUnder a quantitative approach, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The fair value of a reporting unit is determined using the income approach which discounts projected cash flows using market participant assumptions. The discounted cash flow methodology includes significant assumptions including, but not limited to, forecasted revenue, operating profit margins, operating expenses, cash flows, perpetual growth rates, and long-term discount rates. The resulting fair value under a quantitative approach is sensitive to changes in the underlying assumptions. In developing these assumptions, we rely on various factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and other market data. Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying judgments and factors and ultimately impact the estimated fair value determinations may include such items as a prolonged downturn in the business environment, changes in economic conditions that significantly differ from our assumptions in timing or degree, volatility in equity and debt markets resulting in higher discount rates, and unexpected regulatory changes. As a result, there are inherent uncertainties related to these judgments and factors in applying them to the goodwill impairment test.\nAs a result of our IPO, we incur additional legal, accounting, board compensation, and other expenses that we did not previously incur prior to becoming a public company, including costs associated with SEC reporting and corporate governance requirements. These requirements include compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, as well as other rules implemented by the SEC and the national securities exchanges. Our financial statements following our IPO reflect the impact of these expenses.\nIn connection with the ADT Acquisition, $718 million aggregate principal amount of the existing ADT Notes due 2042 were exchanged for new ADT Notes due 2032. In August 2016, an additional $10 million of the ADT Notes due 2042 were exchanged for ADT Notes due 2032 pursuant to a second supplemental indenture and constitute part of the same series of notes as the $718 million of the ADT Notes due 2032.\n\nDepreciation and intangible asset amortization increased $289 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the supplemental pro forma year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to (i) higher depreciation expense of approximately $111 million related to subscriber system assets, which included costs associated with new customer additions and upgrades; (ii) increased amortization of approximately $104 million related to new customer contracts acquired as a result of the ADT Authorized Dealer Program; and (iii) increased amortization expense of $42 million primarily associated with the Protection One trade name, which we began amortizing in July 2016. The remainder of the increase was primarily due to increased software license expenses related to a newly adopted cloud computing standard mentioned above.\n\n (5) In 2018, primarily includes income of approximately $22 million of one-time licensing fees, as well as a gain of $7.5 million from the sale of equity in a third party that we received as part of a settlement during the second quarter of 2018 partially offset by $14 million in compensation arrangements related to acquisitions. In 2017 and 2016, primarily represents fees under a Management Consulting Agreement, which was terminated in connection with the consummation of the IPO.  2018 Compared to 2017\nWe maintain agreements with a network of third-party independent alarm dealers who sell alarm equipment and ADT Authorized Dealer-branded monitoring and interactive services to end users. The dealers in this program generate new end-user contracts with customers which we have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase from the dealer. Purchases of contracts with customers under the ADT Authorized Dealer Program, or from other third parties, are considered asset acquisitions and are recorded at their contractually determined purchase price. We may charge back the purchase price of any end-user contract if the contract is canceled during the charge-back period, which is generally twelve to fifteen months from the date of purchase. We record the amount of the charge back as a reduction to the purchase price.\n______________________\nCost of Revenue\nThe effective tax rates in 2018 and 2017 reflect the tax impact of permanent tax adjustments, state tax expense, changes in tax laws, and non-U.S. net earnings. The effective tax rate can vary from period to period due to permanent tax adjustments, discrete items such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, recurring factors such as changes in the overall effective state tax rate, as well as fluctuations in pre-tax income or loss. Discrete items and permanent tax adjustments will have a greater impact on the effective tax rate when pre-tax income or loss is lower. Refer to Note 7 Income Taxes\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 for further discussion.\nDealer generated customer accounts and bulk account purchases, subscriber system assets and deferred subscriber installation costs, and capital expenditures are included in cash flows from investing activities. Refer to the discussion below under -Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for further details regarding cash flows from investing activities.\n \u2022 February 21, 2018 - $594 million of the aggregate principal amount was voluntarily redeemed at a price of $649 million using proceeds from the IPO  The Prime Notes are due at maturity, however, may be redeemed at our option as follows:\nFree Cash Flow adjusts for cash items that are ultimately within management's discretion to direct, and therefore, may imply that there is less or more cash that is available than the most comparable GAAP measure. Free Cash Flow is not intended to represent residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures since debt repayment requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures are not deducted. These limitations are best addressed by using Free Cash Flow in combination with the cash flows as calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nGross customer revenue attrition is defined as the RMR lost as a result of customer attrition, net of dealer charge-backs and reinstated customers, excluding contracts monitored but not owned. Customer sites are considered canceled when all services are terminated. Dealer charge-backs represent customer cancellations charged back to the dealers because the customer canceled service during the charge-back period, generally twelve to fifteen months.\nOur subscriber-based business requires significant upfront investment to generate new customers, which in turn provides predictable recurring revenue generated from our monitoring and other services. In order to optimize returns on customer acquisitions and cash flow generation, we focus on the following key drivers of our business: best-in-class customer service; increased customer retention; disciplined, high-quality customer additions; efficient customer acquisition; and reduced costs incurred to provide ongoing services to customers.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\n2017 Compared to 2016\n\nRecurring Monthly Revenue ( RMR\u201d)\nIncome tax benefit was $764 million during 2017, resulting in an effective tax rate for the period of 181.3%. The effective tax rate for 2017 reflects the favorable impact of Tax Reform offset by the unfavorable impact of permanent tax adjustments.\n \u2022 On or after May 15, 2019, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 104.625% of the principal amount of the Prime Notes redeemed and accrued and unpaid interest as of, but excluding, the redemption date. The redemption price decreases to 102.313% on or after May 15, 2020, and decreases to 100.000% on or after May 15, 2021.  On February 1, 2019, we redeemed $300 million aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Prime Notes for a total redemption price of $319 million. Following the partial redemption, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Prime Notes was $2,246 million.\nin financial condition, and results of operations. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements about our business, operations, and financial performance based on current plans and estimates that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections of this Annual Report titled Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOn February 27, 2019, we approved a dividend reinvestment plan ( DRIP\u201d) which will allow stockholders to designate all or a portion of the cash dividends on their shares of common stock for reinvestment in additional shares of our common stock. In addition, on February 27, 2019 we approved a share repurchase program which will permit us to repurchase up to $150 million of our shares of common stock through February 27, 2021. We may effect these repurchases pursuant to one or more trading plans to be adopted in accordance with Securities Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1, in privately negotiated transactions, in open market transactions or pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase program. We intend to conduct the share repurchase program in accordance with Securities Exchange Act Rule 10b-18. We are not obligated to repurchase any of our shares of common stock and the timing and amount of any repurchases will depend on legal requirements, market conditions, stock price, alternative uses of capital, and other factors.\nPublic Company Costs\nRMR is generated by contractual monthly recurring fees for monitoring and other recurring services provided to our customers, including contracts monitored but not owned. We believe the presentation of RMR is useful because it measures the volume of revenue under contract at a given point in time.\n (ii) the elimination of The ADT Corporation historical amortization of deferred installation revenue of $58 million as a result of the purchase price allocation for the ADT Acquisition as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2015 because the application of this purchase accounting adjustment has a continuing impact on the Company. \n (i) Primarily consists of amortization of customer relationships and dealer relationships under the ADT Authorized Dealer Program. As of the acquisition date, customer relationships have a weighted-average remaining useful life of approximately 6 years and are amortized on an accelerated basis. \n\n_______________________\nTotal Revenue\nMonitoring and related services revenue increased by $81 million during 2018, which includes incremental revenue associated with acquisitions. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in contractual monthly recurring fees for monitoring and other recurring services, which resulted from the addition of new customers and improvements in average pricing, partially offset by customer attrition. The improvement in average pricing was driven by the addition of new customers at higher rates, largely due to new subscribers generally selecting higher priced services as compared to our existing customers, as well as price escalations on our existing customer base. These factors also were a primary driver for the increase in RMR to $347 million as of December 31, 2018 from $335 million as of December 31, 2017. In addition, approximately 2% of the 4% increase in RMR was due to the Red Hawk Acquisition. Gross customer revenue attrition improved to 13.3% as of December 31, 2018 from 13.7% as of December 31, 2017 as a result of lower voluntary disconnects and lower disconnects due to non-paying customers.\nCash Flow Analysis\nThe following table is a summary of our cash flow activity for the periods presented:\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized and are tested for impairment at least annually as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and more often if an event occurs or circumstances change which indicate it is more-likely-than-not that fair value is less than carrying amount. The annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets may be completed through qualitative assessments. We may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to a quantitative impairment test for any reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period. We may resume the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset in any subsequent period.\nOur ability to add new subscribers depends on the overall demand for our products and solutions, which is driven by a number of external factors. The overall economic condition in the geographies in which we operate can impact our ability to attract new customers and grow our business in all customer channels. Growth in our residential customer base can be influenced by the overall state of the housing market. Growth in our commercial customer base can be influenced by the rate at which new businesses begin operations or existing businesses grow. The demand for our products and solutions is also impacted by the perceived threat of crime, as well as the quality of the service of our competitors.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nLoss on extinguishment of debt in 2018 includes approximately $213 million associated with the Koch Redemption in July 2018, which related to the payment of the redemption premium and tax reimbursements, as well as the write-off of the unamortized discount and deferred financing costs. In addition, loss on extinguishment of debt includes approximately $62 million primarily associated with the partial redemption of the Prime Notes in February 2018, which related to the payment of the call premium, as well as the write-off of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs. Loss on extinguishment of debt in 2017 was not material.\n (2) Relates to the conversion of intercompany loans that are denominated in Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars. \nUnder a qualitative approach, the impairment test for goodwill consists of an assessment of whether it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit, or if a qualitative assessment indicates it is more-likely-than-not that the estimated carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we proceed to a quantitative approach.\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations and other capital requirements, including capital expenditures, as well as make acquisitions, will depend on our future operating performance, which is subject to future general economic, financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other conditions, many of which are beyond our control. See -Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business.\u201d Changes in our operating plans, material changes in anticipated sales, increased expenses, acquisitions, or other events may cause us to seek equity and/or debt financing in future periods. There can be no guarantee that financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Debt financing, if available, could impose additional cash payment obligations and subject us to additional covenants and operating restrictions.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nTo provide investors with additional information in connection with our results as determined by GAAP, we disclose Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow as non-GAAP measures. These measures are not financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flows, or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nRevenue Recognition\nIn transactions involving security systems that are sold outright to the customer, our performance obligations generally include monitoring, related services, and the sale and installation of the security systems. For such arrangements, we allocate a portion of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price. Revenue associated with the sale and installation of security systems is recognized once installation is complete and is reflected in installation and other revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Revenue associated with monitoring and related services is recognized as those services are provided and is reflected in monitoring and related services revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nTotal Revenue\nDuring 2018, cash flows provided by operating activities increased by approximately $196 million compared to 2017 due to the following: (i) an increase in revenue from contractual monthly recurring fees for monitoring and other recurring services; (ii) an increase in revenue from transactions in which security equipment is sold outright to customers partially offset by the associated costs; (iii) a decrease in cash paid related to acquisition, integration, and restructuring costs associated with the ADT Acquisition; and (iv) a decrease in cash paid of $55 million for fees associated with the Special Dividend and fees in connection with amendments and restatements to the First Lien Credit Agreement. These increases in cash flows provided by operating activities were partially offset by a net increase in cash interest paid of $27 million due to the Koch Redemption and higher interest rates on variable-rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, partially offset by a decrease in cash interest paid due to the partial redemption of the Prime Notes in 2018. The remainder of the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities relates to changes in assets and liabilities due to the volume and timing of other operating cash receipts and payments with respect to when the transactions are reflected in earnings.\n (1) In 2017, relates to fees incurred in connection with the Special Dividend and amendments and restatements related to the First Lien Credit Agreement. \nNOTES TO THE UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTAL PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe are also subject to a springing financial maintenance covenant under the First Lien Credit Agreement, which requires us to not exceed a specified first lien leverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter if the testing conditions are satisfied. The covenant is tested if the outstanding loans under the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility, subject to certain exceptions, exceed 30% of the total commitments under the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility at the testing date (i.e., the last day of any fiscal quarter).\n (3) Represents costs associated with upgrading cellular technology used in many of our security systems. \nDepreciation and intangible asset amortization increased by $68 million during 2018. This increase was primarily attributable to $100 million associated with the amortization of customer contracts acquired under the ADT Authorized Dealer Program, partially offset by a decrease in the amortization of trade names of $41 million primarily associated with the Protection One trade name, which became fully amortized in June 2018.\n \u2022 As of December 31, 2018, the First Lien Term B-1 Loan has an outstanding aggregate principal balance of $3,924 million, which represents the following events: \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $38 million during 2018. The increase was related to $124 million associated with our equity compensation awards, which were impacted by the completion of our IPO, $11 million related to compensation arrangements associated with acquisitions, as well as other incremental general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by:\ncontracts utilizes an average declining balance rate of approximately 300% and converts to straight-line methodology when the resulting amortization charge is greater than that from the accelerated method, resulting in an average amortization of approximately 65% of the pool within the first five years, 25% within the second five years, and 10% within the final five years.\nThe largest impact from the new standard relates to the timing of recognition of certain incremental selling costs associated with acquiring new customers. Under the new standard, certain costs previously amortized over the initial contract term will now be amortized in pools based on the expected life of a customer relationship using an accelerated method over 15 years. To a lesser extent, the adoption of the new standard impacted the identification of performance obligations and the allocation of transaction price to those performance obligations for certain sales of security systems sold outright to customers.\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years, and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions, including the amount of future pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage its underlying businesses.\nOn July 2, 2018, we redeemed the original stated value of $750 million of the Koch Preferred Securities for total consideration of approximately $949 million using proceeds from the IPO and cash on hand. The total consideration paid includes approximately $103 million related to the redemption premium and tax reimbursements, as well as $96 million related to the accumulated dividend obligation on the Koch Preferred Securities. We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $213 million as a result of the redemption. The dividend obligation incurred on the Koch Preferred Securities was $51 million, $86 million, and $53 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The remaining proceeds from the IPO were used to pay IPO related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes.\n \u25e6 February 13, 2017 - $800 million of borrowings in order to fund the Special Dividend; \nRed Hawk Acquisition\nCost of Revenue\nAdjusted EBITDA and Supplemental Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA\nSIGNIFICANT EVENTS\nOn May 2, 2016, we completed our acquisition of The ADT Corporation, a leading provider of monitored security and interactive automation solutions in the U.S. and Canada. The ADT Acquisition provided us the ability to continue to expand our market presence in the security industry by leveraging the ADT brand name and other best practices.\nDuring 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to proceeds from borrowings and equity capital contributions, as well as proceeds from the issuance of the Koch Preferred Securities, to fund the ADT Acquisition. The proceeds, as well as repayments of long-term borrowings, were primarily attributable to the amendments and restatements to the First Lien Credit Agreement. Additionally, repayments of long-term borrowings include $260 million of voluntary prepayments of the outstanding principal balance of a second lien term loan, as well as a $22 million paydown of the outstanding balance on a revolving credit facility. We also incurred approximately $104 million in deferred financing costs associated with the long-term borrowings and the issuance of the Koch Preferred Securities and paid $35 million primarily associated with escrow payments to former ASG and Protection One shareholders.\nOther income (expense) is attributable to net foreign currency gains of $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and losses of $16 million for the supplemental pro forma year ended December 31, 2016 related to the conversion of intercompany loans that are denominated in Canadian dollars.\nIn January 2018, we completed our IPO in which we issued and sold 105,000,000 shares of common stock at an initial public offering price of $14.00 per share. Net proceeds from the IPO were $1,406 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and offering expenses.\nMonitoring and related services revenue increased by $1,281 million during 2017. This increase was largely attributable to incremental revenue of approximately $1,168 million in 2017 associated with the ADT Acquisition and the amortization of deferred revenue as a result of the application of purchase accounting in connection with the ADT Acquisition that reduced revenue by $63 million during 2016.\nGoodwill Impairment\nThese decreases were partially offset by costs of approximately $64 million of financing and consent fees incurred in 2017 and increased costs of approximately $35 million related to the amortization of deferred subscriber acquisition costs associated with direct and incremental costs incurred to acquire new customers. The remainder of the increases were primarily due to non-cash asset write-downs related to our strategic investments.\nOn February 21, 2018, we used approximately $649 million of the proceeds from the IPO to redeem $594 million aggregate principal amount of Prime Notes and pay the related call premium.\nSubscriber system assets and any related deferred subscriber acquisition costs resulting from customer acquisitions are accounted for using pools based on the month and year of acquisition. We amortize our pooled subscriber system assets and related deferred subscriber acquisition costs using an accelerated method over the estimated life of the customer relationship, which is 15 years. We periodically perform lifing studies to estimate the expected life of the customer relationship and the attrition pattern of our customers. The lifing studies are based on historical customer terminations and are used to establish the amortization rates of our customer account pools in order to reflect the pattern of future benefit. The results of the lifing studies indicate that we can expect attrition to be the greatest in the initial years of asset life; therefore, an accelerated method best matches the future amortization cost with the estimated revenue stream from these customer pools. In order to align the amortization of subscriber system assets and related deferred costs to the pattern in which their economic benefits are consumed, the accelerated method utilizes an average declining balance rate of approximately 250% and converts to straight-line methodology when the resulting amortization charge is greater than that from the accelerated method, resulting in an average amortization of approximately 55% of the pool within the first five years, 25% within the second five years, and 20% within the final five years.\nWe believe that the presentation of Free Cash Flow is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about our ability to repay debt, make other investments, and pay dividends.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment\nRefer to Note 1 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 for further discussion about recent accounting pronouncements.\n (4) Includes $20 million of Management Consulting Agreement fees during 2017 and supplemental pro forma 2016. Such agreement was terminated in connection with the consummation of the IPO.  Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $176 million as compared to the Supplemental Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the supplemental pro forma year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was driven by an increase in revenue as well as reductions in selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding items outside of our definition of Adjusted EBITDA, which were partially offset by increases in cost of revenue.\nUnaudited Supplemental Pro Forma Results of Operations\n 1(d) To record the following net decrease in depreciation and intangible asset amortization as a result of the purchase price allocation associated with the ADT Acquisition: \nIncome tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $764 million as compared to $119 million for the supplemental pro forma year ended December 31, 2016, resulting in an effective tax rate of 181.3% as compared to an effective tax rate of 29.4% for the respective periods. Refer to the -Income Tax Benefit\u201d section above in Results of Operations\u201d for information on the Tax Reform impact on income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nDuring 2018, Adjusted EBITDA increased by $101 million. This increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue from contractual monthly recurring fees for monitoring and other recurring services, as well as higher revenue on transactions in which security equipment is sold outright to customers partially offset by the associated costs. The remainder of this increase was attributable to a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding items outside of our definition of Adjusted EBITDA.\nWe are a leading provider of monitored security and interactive home and business automation solutions in the U.S. and Canada. Our monitored security and automation offerings involve the installation and monitoring of security and premises automation systems designed to detect intrusion; control access; sense movement, smoke, fire, carbon monoxide, flooding, temperature, and other environmental conditions and hazards; and address personal emergencies such as injuries, medical emergencies, or incapacitation. Our products and services include interactive technologies to allow our customers to remotely monitor and manage their residential and commercial environments by adding automation capabilities to our monitored security systems. Through our interactive offerings, customers are able to remotely access information regarding the security of their residential or commercial environment, arm and disarm their security system, adjust lighting or thermostat levels, or view real-time video from cameras covering different areas of their premises via web-enabled devices (such as smart phones, laptops, and tablet computers) and a customized web portal. Additionally, our interactive automation solutions enable customers to create customized schedules or automation for managing lights, thermostats, appliances, and garage doors. The system can also be programmed to perform additional functions such as recording and viewing live video and sending text messages based on triggering events.\nDuring 2018, other income primarily includes $22 million of licensing fees, as well as a gain of $7.5 million from the sale of equity in a third party that we received as part of a settlement.\n (2) Represents the estimated interest payments on our debt obligations as of December 31, 2018. Interest payments on our fixed-rate debt are calculated based on the contractual terms. Interest payments on our variable-rate debt, including the effects of our interest rate swaps, are calculated based on a forward LIBOR curve (or floor, whichever is higher) plus the applicable margin in effect as of December 31, 2018. Refer to Note 5 Debt\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 for further discussion. \n (i) the reversal of a purchase accounting adjustment related to the write-down to fair value of deferred revenue associated with services not yet rendered of $63 million that is directly related to the ADT Acquisition, but does not have a continuing impact on the Company; and \nTax Reform was signed into law on December 22, 2017. In response to Tax Reform, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d), which allowed companies to record provisional estimates of the effects of the legislative change, and a one-year measurement period to finalize the accounting of those effects. As of December 31, 2018, we completed the accounting for the tax effects of Tax Reform and recorded no material changes to the provisional estimates recorded in 2017.\nTotal Revenue\nIncome tax benefit was $23 million during 2018, resulting in an effective tax rate for the period of 3.7%. The effective tax rate reflects the reduced federal income tax rate of 21% as a result of Tax Reform, a 10.3% unfavorable impact from permanent non-deductible expenses, primarily associated with the Koch Preferred Securities, a 5.8% unfavorable impact from future non-deductible share-based compensation, a 3.7% unfavorable impact from non-deductible goodwill impairment loss, and a 3.2% unfavorable impact from state legislative changes, offset by a 3.8% favorable impact of tax adjustments related to prior year state returns filed in the first quarter of 2018.\n__________________\nWe make certain investments in our business that are intended to grow our customer base, enhance the overall customer experience, improve the productivity of our field workforce, and support greater efficiency of our back-office systems and our customer care centers.\nOur goal is to extend the concept of security from the physical home or business to cybersecurity and personal on-the-go security and safety. Customers' increasingly mobile and active lifestyles have created new opportunities for us in the fast-growing market for self-monitored and DIY products and services. Our technology also allows us to service our customers via various connected and wearable devices whether they are at home or on-the-go.\nINTRODUCTION\nOther Income (Expense)\naccumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2018, we have completed the accounting for the tax effects of this legislative change, and recorded no material changes to the provisional estimates recorded in 2017.\nDeferred subscriber acquisition revenue is deferred and reported as deferred subscriber acquisition revenue in the Consolidated Balance Sheets upon initiation of a monitoring contract. Deferred subscriber acquisition revenue is amortized in pools into installation and other revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the estimated life of the customer relationship using an accelerated method consistent with the amortization of subscriber system assets and deferred subscriber acquisition costs associated with the transaction.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $350 million during 2017. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to incremental expenses associated with The ADT Corporation business of approximately $324 million. The remainder of the increase, excluding the impact from the incremental expenses associated with The ADT Corporation business, was primarily due to (i) $64 million of financing and consent fees incurred in 2017 and (ii) an increase related to the amortization of deferred subscriber acquisition costs of approximately $25 million. These costs were partially offset by (i) decreases in general and administrative and advertising expenses of $31 million that were primarily the result of synergies associated with the ADT Acquisition and (ii) a decrease in radio conversion costs of $27 million.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt was $4 million and $28 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively, and primarily related to the write-off of debt discount and issuance costs associated with amendments and restatements to our First Lien Credit Agreement, as well as the voluntary paydown of $260 million of the second lien term loan, as defined herein, in July and October 2016.\nThe remainder of the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in contractual monthly recurring fees for monitoring and other recurring services, which resulted from the addition of new customers and improvements in average pricing, partially offset by customer attrition. The improvement in average pricing was driven by the addition of new customers at higher rates, largely due to new subscribers generally selecting higher priced services as compared to our existing customers, as well as price escalations on our existing customer base. These factors also were the primary driver for an increase in RMR to $335 million as of December 31, 2017 from $328 million as of December 31, 2016. Gross customer revenue attrition improved to 13.7% as of December 31, 2017 from 14.8% as of December 31, 2016 as a result of our enhanced focus on high quality customer additions through our disciplined customer selection process.\n (i) decreases in financing and consent fees of $55 million due to fees of $9 million incurred during 2018 in connection with amendments and restatements to the First Lien Credit Agreement as compared to $64 million of fees incurred during 2017 in connection with the payment of the Special Dividend and amendments and restatements to the First Lien Credit Agreement; \n \u25e6 December 3, 2018 - $425 million of borrowings in order to partially fund the Red Hawk Acquisition and to fund the partial redemption of the Prime Notes in February 2019; and \nIncome Tax Benefit\nInterest Expense, net\nAdditionally, upon the occurrence of specified change of control events, we must offer to purchase the Prime Notes and ADT Notes at 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the purchase date.\nWe may redeem the ADT Notes, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus a make-whole premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest as of, but excluding, the redemption date.\nThe amortizable life and method of amortization of our contracts and related customer relationships acquired as part of the Formation Transactions and the ADT Acquisition are based on management estimates about the amounts and timing of expected future revenue from customer accounts and average customer account life as of the Formation Transactions and the ADT Acquisition. The amortizable life and method of amortization of our dealer relationships are based on management estimates about the longevity of the underlying dealer network and the attrition of those respective dealers that existed as of the Formation Transactions and the ADT Acquisition. Contracts and related customer relationships acquired as part of the Red Hawk Acquisition are amortized over a period of 10 to 15 years on a straight-line basis. Other definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over a period of up to 10 years on a straight-line basis.\nDividend Reinvestment Plan and Share Repurchase Program\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nADT Acquisition\n \u2022 The First Lien Credit Agreement includes a first lien revolving credit facility with an aggregate available commitment of up to $350 million through March 16, 2023 ( First Lien Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). As of December 31, 2018, there were no outstanding amounts under the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility.  Borrowings under the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (a) Adjusted LIBOR, or (b) the Base Rate, plus the applicable margin of 2.75% for Adjusted LIBOR loans and 1.75% for Base Rate loans. Additionally, we are required to pay a commitment fee between 0.375% and 0.50% (determined based on a net first lien leverage ratio) with respect to the unused commitments under the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility.\nIn connection with the ADT Acquisition, we entered into supplemental indentures to notes originally issued by The ADT Corporation (collectively, the ADT Notes\u201d) providing for each series of ADT Notes to benefit from (i) guarantees by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries and (ii) first-priority senior security interests, subject to permitted liens, in substantially all of the existing and future assets of our domestic subsidiaries. As a result, these notes remained outstanding and became obligations of ours.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA and Supplemental Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, as applicable, for the periods presented:\nDuring 2017, Adjusted EBITDA increased by $820 million. This increase was primarily due to incremental revenue net of incremental costs associated with The ADT Corporation business. The remainder of this increase was attributable to revenue growth, excluding the impact of purchase accounting, and a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding items outside of our definition of Adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by increase in cost of revenue.\nWe are a highly leveraged company with significant debt service requirements. As of December 31, 2018, we had $363 million in cash and cash equivalents and $350 million available under our revolving credit facility. The carrying value of total debt outstanding was $10,002 million as of December 31, 2018. On February 15, 2019, we entered into an additional first lien revolving credit agreement with an aggregate available commitment of up to $50 million maturing on March 16, 2023.\nDebt Covenants\nOur federal income tax accounts are determined on a consolidated return basis for U.S. entities and on a standalone basis for Canadian entities.\nWe believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain non-cash items and about unusual items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future, as well as other items. Further, we believe Adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful measure of operating profitability because we use it for evaluating our business performance, making budgeting decisions, and comparing our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures.\nNet interest expense was primarily comprised of interest expense on our long-term debt and the dividend obligation associated with the Koch Preferred Securities and decreased by $70 million during 2018. The decrease in net interest expense was primarily driven by a reduction in interest expense of $47 million due to the redemption of $594 million aggregate principal amount of the Prime Notes in February 2018 and a reduction in interest expense of approximately $37 million due to the Koch Redemption in July of 2018. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of approximately $24 million due to an increase in interest rates on our variable-rate debt, including the impact of our interest rate swaps. Refer to the -Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section for further discussion regarding our debt and interest.\na greater impact on the effective tax rate when pre-tax income is lower. Refer to Note 7 Income Taxes\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 for further discussion.\nWe generate revenue primarily through contractual monthly recurring fees received for monitoring and related services provided to customers. In transactions in which we provide monitoring and related services but retain ownership of the security systems, our performance obligations primarily include monitoring, related services (such as maintenance agreements), and a material right associated with the non-refundable fees received in connection with the initiation of a monitoring contract (referred to as deferred subscriber acquisition revenue) that the customer will not need to pay upon a renewal of the contract. The portion of the transaction price associated with monitoring and related services revenue is recognized as those services are provided and is reflected in monitoring and related services revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nOn December 3, 2018, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Red Hawk Fire & Security, a leader in commercial fire, life safety, and security services, for total consideration of $318 million and cash paid of $301 million, net of cash acquired ( Red Hawk Acquisition\u201d). We funded the Red Hawk Acquisition from a combination of additional debt financing and cash on hand. This acquisition is intended to accelerate our growth in the commercial security market and expand our product portfolio with the introduction of commercial fire safety related solutions.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to select accounting policies and make estimates that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. Management's estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or market conditions. The following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for 2016 resulted from $620 million of net income, exclusive of depreciation and intangible assets amortization and other non-cash items, and reflects: (i) cash interest paid of $431 million, (ii) transaction costs of $347 million associated with the ADT Acquisition, (iii) cash paid of $29 million for fees in connection with amendments and restatements to the First Lien Credit Agreement, (iv) cash paid for radio conversion costs of $43 million, (v) restructuring payments of $52 million primarily associated with the ADT Acquisition, (iv) other cash payments of $28 million that are primarily related to integration costs of $13 million, management consulting fees of $13 million, and $2 million of other items. The remainder relates to changes in assets and liabilities due to the volume and timing of other operating cash receipts and payments.\nIn evaluating our results, we utilize key performance indicators which include non-GAAP measures as well as the operating metrics of gross revenue attrition, unit and customer count, RMR, RMR additions and revenue payback. Our computations of key performance indicators may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Additionally, our operating metric key performance indicators are approximated as there may be variations to reported results in each period due to certain adjustments we might make in connection with the integration over several periods of acquired companies that calculated these metrics differently, or otherwise, including periodic reassessments and refinements in the ordinary course of business. These refinements, for example, may include changes due to systems conversion or historical methodology differences in legacy systems.", "item_7_tables": "Table 97: <table><tr><td> </td>

leading provider of monitored security and interactive home and business automation solutions in the U.S. and Canada. Its products and services include security systems as well as interactive technologies that allow remote monitoring and control.\n\n- In 2018, total revenue increased to $4.6 billion compared to $4.3 billion in 2017. The increase was driven by growth in monitoring and related services revenue as well as installation and other revenue. Net loss in 2018 was $609 million compared to net income of $343 million in 2017, primarily due to higher interest expense, loss on debt extinguishment, and goodwill impairment. \n\n- In 2018, ADT completed an initial public offering, raising net proceeds of $1.4 billion. The proceeds were used to redeem high-interest debt and pay dividends. ADT also acquired Red Hawk Fire & Security to accelerate growth in commercial security. \n\n- Adjusted EBITDA, a key profitability metric, increased to $2.5 billion in 2018 from $2.4 billion in 2017. The increase was driven by revenue growth and decreases in certain operating expenses.\n\n- Cash flows from operations increased in 2018 due to revenue growth and lower integration and restructuring costs. This was partially offset by higher interest payments. Cash used in investing activities increased due to acquisitions. Cash from financing increased due to IPO proceeds, offset by debt repayments and dividends.\n\n- As of December 31, 2018, ADT had $10 billion of debt outstanding. The company remains highly leveraged but believes it can meet liquidity needs through cash generation, borrowing capacity, and access to capital markets.\n\nIn summary, ADT grew revenue and Adjusted EBITDA in 2018 through organic growth and acquisitions. The IPO strengthened the balance sheet but the company continues to operate with high leverage."}
