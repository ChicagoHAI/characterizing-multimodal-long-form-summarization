The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements as of, and for the years ended, December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nOverview\nWe are a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mediacom Communications Corporation ( MCC\u201d), the nation's eighth largest cable company based on the number of customers who purchase one or more video services, also known as video customers. As of December 31, 2015, we served approximately 480,000 video customers, 605,000 high-speed data ( HSD\u201d) customers and 239,000 phone customers, aggregating 1.32 million primary service units ( PSUs\u201d). As of the same date, we served 732,000 residential and business customer relationships.\nWe offer video, HSD and phone services to residential and small- to medium-sized business ( SMB\u201d) customers over our hybrid fiber and coaxial cable network. We believe our customers prefer the cost savings of the bundled services we offer, as well as the convenience of having a single provider contact for ordering, provisioning, billing and customer care. We also provide network and transport services to medium- and large sized businesses, governments, and educational institutions in our service areas, including cell tower backhaul for wireless telephone providers, and sell advertising time to local, regional and national advertisers.\nOver the past several years, losses in our residential video customer base have been primarily responsible for slower growth in our residential revenues, while we have rapidly increased our business services revenues through customer gains. We expect to continue to grow revenues through customer additions in business services and, to a lesser extent, in residential services. Business services revenues are expected to grow through HSD and phone sales to SMBs and a greater number of cell tower backhaul sites and large enterprise customers. Revenues from residential services are expected to grow as a result of HSD and phone customer growth, with gains in revenue per PSU, as more customers take higher HSD tiers and advanced video services.\nOur recent performance has been adversely affected by tepid economic growth in the post-recession period and significant video competition. We believe the historically slower economic recovery from the recession, including the uneven gains in household income, occupied housing, and new housing starts, has largely contributed to lower sales and connect activity for all of our residential services and negatively impacted our residential customer and revenue growth. While we expect improvement if and when the economy strengthens further, a continuation or broadening of such effects may adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nOur residential video service principally competes with direct broadcast satellite ( DBS\u201d) providers, who offer video programming substantially similar to ours. Over the past several years, we have experienced meaningful video customer losses, as DBS competitors have deployed aggressive marketing campaigns, including deeply discounted promotional packages, more advanced customer premise equipment and exclusive sports programming. We also have placed a greater emphasis on higher quality customer relationships in our residential services, as we have generally eliminated or reduced tactical discounts for customers not likely to purchase two or more services or to stay with us for an extended period, which may further contribute to video customer declines. Our next-generation, multi-room set-top gives customers the same stored content on multiple televisions in their home and a cloud-based, graphically-rich TiVo guide, with Netflix, YouTube, Pandora and other popular apps, advanced search functionality, in-home video streaming to personal devices and the ability to download certain content to their mobile devices for viewing outside of their home. We believe our video strategy may enable us to reduce video customer losses and regain market share of new connects. If we are unsuccessful with this strategy and cannot offset video customer losses through higher average unit pricing and greater penetration of our advanced video services, we may experience future annual declines in video revenues.\nOur residential HSD service competes primarily with digital subscriber line ( DSL\u201d) services offered by local telephone companies. Based upon the speeds we offer, we believe our HSD service is generally superior to DSL offerings in our service areas. As consumers' bandwidth requirements have dramatically increased in the past few years, a trend many industry experts expect to continue, we believe our ability to offer a HSD service today with downstream speeds of up to 150Mbps gives us a competitive advantage compared to the DSL service offered by the local telephone companies. We expect to continue to grow HSD revenues through residential customer growth and more customers taking higher HSD speed tiers.\nOur residential phone service mainly competes with substantially comparable phone services offered by local telephone companies and cellular phone services offered by national wireless providers. We believe we will grow phone revenues through residential phone customer growth, which may be mostly offset by unit pricing pressure.\nOur business services largely compete with local phone companies, or local exchange carriers ( LECs\u201d). Our fast-growing cell tower backhaul business primarily competes with LECs. Developments and advancements in products and services by new, emerging companies may intensify competition. We have experienced strong growth rates of business services revenues in the past several years, which we believe will continue.\nWe face significant competition in our advertising business from a wide range of national, regional and local competitors. Competition will likely elevate as new formats for advertising are introduced into our markets. We compete for advertising revenues principally against local broadcast stations, national cable and broadcast networks, radio, newspapers, magazines, outdoor display and Internet companies. Due to the strong contributions of political advertising during a national election year, we expect to experience an increase in advertising revenues in 2016.\nHistorically, video programming has been our single largest expense, and we have experienced substantial increases in video programming costs per video customer, particularly for sports and local broadcast programming, well in excess of the inflation rate or the change in the consumer price index. We believe these expenses will continue to grow at a high single- to low double-digit rate because of the demands of large media conglomerates or other owners of most of the popular cable networks and major market local broadcast stations, and of large independent television broadcast groups, who own or control a significant number of local broadcast stations across the country and, in some cases, own, control or otherwise represent multiple stations in the same market. Moreover, many of those powerful owners of programming require us to purchase their networks and stations in bundles and effectively dictate how we offer them to our customers, given the contractual economic penalties if we fail to comply. Consequently, we have little or no ability to individually or selectively negotiate for networks or stations, to forego purchasing networks or stations that generate low customer interest, to offer sports programming services, such as ESPN and regional sports networks, on one or more separate tiers, or to offer networks or stations on an a la carte basis to give our customers more choice and potentially lower their costs. In many instances, such programmers have created additional networks and migrated popular programming, particularly sports programming, to these new networks, which has contributed to the increases in our programming costs. Additionally, we believe certain programmers may also demand higher fees from us in an effort to partially offset declines in their advertising revenue as more advertisers allocate a greater portion of their spending to Internet advertising. While such growth in programming expenses can be offset, in whole or in part, by rate increases, we expect our video gross margins will continue to decline if increases in programming costs outpace any growth in video revenues.\n2015 Financing Activity\nOn August 12, 2015 and November 23, 2015, we entered into incremental facility agreements that provided for $25.0 million and $87.5 million of additional revolving credit commitments, respectively.\nOn December 17, 2015, we completed a new term loan ( Term Loan A\u201d) in the aggregate principal amount of $151.5 million, and used the net proceeds from Term Loan A, together with borrowings under our revolving credit commitments, to repay the entire $194.0 million balance of Term Loan G.\nSee Liquidity and Capital Resources - Capital Structure - 2015 Financing Activity\u201d and Note 6 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenues\nVideo\nVideo revenues primarily represent monthly subscription fees charged to residential customers, which vary according to the level of service and equipment taken, and revenue from the sale of VOD content and pay-per-view events. Video revenues also include installation, reconnection and wire maintenance fees, franchise and late payment fees, and other ancillary revenues.\nHSD\nHSD revenues primarily represent monthly subscription fees charged to residential customers, which vary according to the level of service and equipment taken.\nPhone\nPhone revenues primarily represent monthly subscription fees and equipment charged to residential customers for our phone service.\nBusiness Services\nBusiness services revenues primarily represent monthly fees charged to SMBs for video, HSD and phone services, which vary according to the level of service taken, and fees charged to large businesses, including revenues from cell tower backhaul and enterprise class services.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising revenues primarily represent revenues received from selling advertising time we receive under programming license agreements to local, regional and national advertisers for the placement of commercials on channels offered on our video services.\nCosts and Expenses\nService Costs\nService costs consist of the costs related to providing and maintaining services to our customers. Significant service costs comprise: video programming; HSD service, including bandwidth connectivity; phone service, including leased circuits and long distance; our enterprise networks business, including leased access; technical personnel who maintain the cable network, perform customer installation activities and provide customer support; network operations center; utilities, including pole rental; and field operations, including outside contractors, vehicle fuel and maintenance and leased fiber for regional connectivity.\nProgramming costs, which are generally paid on a per video customer basis, have historically represented our single largest expense. In recent years, we have experienced substantial increases in the per-unit cost of programming, which we believe will continue to grow due to the increasing contractual rates and retransmission consent fees demanded by large programmers and independent broadcasters. Our HSD costs fluctuate depending on customers' bandwidth consumption and customer growth. Phone service costs are mainly determined by network configuration, customers' long distance usage and net termination payments to other carriers. Our other service costs generally rise as a result of customer growth and inflationary cost increases for personnel, outside vendors and other expenses. Personnel and related support costs may increase as the percentage of expenses that we capitalize declines due to lower levels of new service installations. We anticipate that service costs, with the exception of programming expenses, will remain fairly consistent as a percentage of our revenues.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSignificant selling, general and administrative expenses comprise: call center, customer service, marketing, business services, support and administrative personnel; franchise fees and other taxes; bad debt; billing; marketing; advertising; and general office administration. These expenses generally rise due to customer growth and inflationary cost increases for personnel, outside vendors and other expenses. We anticipate that selling, general and administrative expenses will remain fairly consistent as a percentage of our revenues.\nService costs and selling, general and administrative expenses exclude depreciation and amortization, which we present separately.\nManagement Fee Expense\nManagement fee expense reflects compensation paid to MCC for the performance of services it provides our operating subsidiaries in accordance with management agreements between MCC and our operating subsidiaries.\nSee Note 9 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nOIBDA\u201d is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) in the United States. We define OIBDA as operating income before depreciation and amortization. OIBDA has inherent limitations as discussed below.\nOIBDA is one of the primary measures used by management to evaluate our performance and to forecast future results. We believe OIBDA is useful for investors because it enables them to assess our performance in a manner similar to the methods used by management, and provides a measure that can be used to analyze value and compare the companies in the cable industry. A limitation of OIBDA, however, is that it excludes depreciation and amortization, which represents the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our business. Management uses a separate process to budget, measure and evaluate capital expenditures. In addition, OIBDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, which may have different depreciation and amortization policies.\nOIBDA should not be regarded as an alternative to operating income or net income as an indicator of operating performance, or to the statement of cash flows as a measure of liquidity, nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe that operating income is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to OIBDA.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nThe table below sets forth our

part by declines in advertising and, to a lesser extent, phone revenues compared to the prior year.\nVideo\nVideo revenues increased 0.5%, mainly due to rate adjustments associated with the pass-through of higher programming costs for retransmission consent fees and, to a lesser extent, for regional sports networks, mostly offset by a lower average residential video customer base than the prior year. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we lost 20,000 video customers, compared to a loss of 28,000 video customers in the prior year. As of December 31, 2015, we served 480,000 video customers, or 32.1% of our estimated homes passed.\nHSD\nHSD revenues grew 11.1%, predominantly due to a higher average residential HSD customer base than the prior year and greater rates per residential HSD customer, largely a result of more customers taking faster speed tiers. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we gained 41,000 HSD customers, compared to a gain of 30,000 HSD customers in the prior year. As of December 31, 2015, we served 605,000 HSD customers, or 40.4% of our estimated homes passed.\nPhone\nPhone revenues decreased 4.8%, principally due to lower revenues per residential phone customer, largely a result of greater levels of discounted pricing, offset in part by a higher average residential phone customer base than the prior year. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we gained 21,000 phone customers, compared to a gain of 11,000 phone customers in the prior year. As of December 31, 2015, we served 239,000 phone customers, or 16.0% of our estimated homes passed.\nBusiness Services\nBusiness services revenues rose 11.6%, mainly as a result of a higher average SMB customer base than the prior year.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising revenues fell 14.8%, substantially due to lower levels of political advertising compared to the prior year that had strong levels of political advertising associated with national elections.\nCosts and Expenses\nService Costs\nService costs increased 5.4%, predominantly due to greater video programming expenses. Programming expenses grew 7.8%, primarily due to higher fees associated with the renewal of programming contracts for certain sports and other popular cable networks and for local broadcast stations, and contractual increases under existing carriage agreements, offset in part by a lower average video customer base since the prior year. Service costs as a percentage of revenues were 40.9% and 40.2% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 1.1%, largely as a result of greater marketing costs, offset in part by lower bad debt and administrative expenses. Marketing costs grew 11.7%, principally due to advertising costs associated with a rebranding campaign, higher business services marketing and greater use of third-party sales services. Bad debt declined 8.0%, substantially due to a lower number of written off accounts. Administrative expenses fell 20.8%, mainly as a result of lower customer service software costs and a decline in legal and other professional fees. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 18.5% and 19.0% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nManagement Fee Expense\nManagement fee expense grew 7.6%, reflecting higher fees charged by MCC. Management fee expense as a percentage of revenues were 1.9% for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization was 6.0% lower, mainly due to older network assets becoming fully depreciated, offset in part by greater depreciation of customer premise equipment and investments in HSD bandwidth expansion and business support.\nOIBDA\nOIBDA grew 2.6%, primarily due to the increase in revenues, offset in part by higher programming costs.\nOperating Income\nOperating income rose 8.8%, as a result of lower depreciation and amortization and the growth in OIBDA.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net, decreased 5.7%, principally due to a lower average cost of debt, offset in part by higher average outstanding indebtedness.\nGain on Derivatives, Net\nAs a result of changes to the mark-to-market valuation of our interest rate swaps, based on information provided by our counterparties, we recorded net gains on derivatives of $9.2 million and $23.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nSee Notes 4 and 6 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt totaled $4.4 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which represented the write-off of unamortized financing costs as a result of the repayment of certain previously existing term loans under our bank credit facility.\nOther Expense, Net\nOther expense, net, was $1.4 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015, other expense, net, comprised $1.2 million of revolving credit commitment fees and $0.6 million of other fees, offset in part by $0.4 million of rental income. During the year ended December 31, 2014, other expense, net, comprised $1.4 million of revolving credit commitment fees and $0.3 million of other fees, offset in part by $0.4 million of rental income.\nNet Income\nAs a result of the factors described above, we recognized net income of $144.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $137.4 million in the prior year.\nYear

greater HSD, business services and, to a lesser extent, advertising revenues, offset in part by lower video and, to a lesser extent, phone revenues compared to the prior year.\nVideo\nVideo revenues declined 1.6%, mainly due to a lower average residential video customer base than the prior year, largely offset by rate adjustments and, to a lesser extent, greater installation fee revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we lost 28,000 video customers, compared to a loss of 30,000 video customers in the prior year. As of December 31, 2014, we served 500,000 video customers, or 33.4% of our estimated homes passed.\nHSD\nHSD revenues grew 7.4%, predominantly due to a higher average residential HSD customer base than the prior year and more customers taking faster speed tiers. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we gained 30,000 HSD customers, compared to an increase of 29,000 HSD customers in the prior year. As of December 31, 2014, we served 564,000 HSD customers, or 37.6% of our estimated homes passed.\nPhone\nPhone revenues decreased 3.8%, principally due to lower revenues per residential phone customer.

As of December 31, 2014, we served 218,000 phone customers, or 14.5% of our estimated homes passed.\nBusiness Services\nBusiness services revenues grew 14.1%, mainly as a result of a higher average SMB customer base than the prior year and, to a much lesser extent, greater cell tower backhaul revenues.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising revenues rose 14.8%, primarily due to greater levels of political advertising compared to the prior year.\nCosts and Expenses\nService Costs\nService costs increased 4.3%, largely a result of greater programming, employee and field operating costs. Programming expenses grew 2.0%, primarily due to greater retransmission consent fees charged for local broadcast stations and, to a lesser extent, higher contractual rates charged by our programming vendors for their cable networks, offset in part by a lower average video customer base. Employee costs were 8.3% higher, largely a result of the re-designation of certain business services employees previously included in selling, general, and administrative expenses. Field operating costs rose 8.3%, principally due to a greater use of outside contractors for customer installations. HSD expenses rose 23.1%, mainly due to a greater number of equipment maintenance contracts, higher bandwidth consumption by our HSD customers, and greater costs associated with our enterprise networks business. Service costs as a percentage of revenues were 40.2% and 39.8% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased 2.8%, largely as a result of lower employee costs, taxes and fees, and office expenses. Employee expenses were 6.7% lower, mainly as a result of the re-designation of certain business services employees previously included in selling, general, and administrative costs. Taxes and fees declined 9.0%, chiefly due to lower franchise fees and, to a lesser extent, property taxes. Office expenses fell 13.8% primarily due to lower rent and telecommunications costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 19.0% and 20.2% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nManagement Fee Expense\nManagement fee expense grew 6.3%, reflecting higher fees charged by MCC. Management fee expense as a percentage of revenues were 1.9% and 1.8% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization was 1.9% lower, as certain assets becoming fully depreciated was mostly offset by the depreciation of investments in customer premise equipment and our business services offerings.\nOIBDA\nOIBDA grew 5.2%, as the increase in revenues and, to a much lesser extent, the decline in selling, general, and administrative expenses, were offset in part by greater service costs and, to a much lesser extent, management fee expense.\nOperating Income\nOperating income rose 10.9%, predominantly due to the growth in OIBDA and, to a much lesser extent, lower depreciation and amortization.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net, increased 4.4%, principally due to a higher average cost of debt, offset in part by lower average outstanding indebtedness.\nGain on Derivatives, Net\nAs a result of changes to the mark-to-market valuation of these interest rate swaps, based on information provided by our counterparties, we recorded net gains on derivatives of $23.2 million and $22.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt totaled $0.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which represented the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs as a result of the repayment of certain term loans under our bank credit facility.\nOther Expense, Net\nOther expense, net, was $1.3 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2014, other expense, net, comprised $1.4 million of revolving credit commitment fees and $0.3 million of other fees, offset in part by $0.4 million of rental income. During the year ended December 31, 2013, other expense, net, consisted of $1.0 million of revolving credit commitment fees and $0.8 million of other fees.\nNet Income\nAs a result of the factors described above, we recognized net income of $137.4 million and $118.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur net cash flows provided by operating activities are primarily used to fund investments to enhance the capacity and reliability of our network and further expand our products and services, as well as for repayments of our indebtedness and periodic distributions to MCC. As of December 31, 2015, our near-term liquidity requirements included scheduled term loan principal repayments of $19.1 million for the year ending December 31, 2016. As of the same date, our sources of liquidity included $10.4 million of cash and $306.6 million of unused and available commitments under our $368.5 million revolving credit facility, after giving effect to $51.5 million of outstanding loans and $10.4 million of letters of credit issued to various parties as collateral.\nWe believe that cash generated by, or available to, us will be sufficient to meet our other anticipated capital and liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months. In the longer term, we may not generate sufficient net cash flows from operations to fund our maturing term loans and senior notes. If we are unable to obtain sufficient future financing on acceptable terms, or at all, we may need to take other actions to conserve or raise capital that we would not take otherwise. However, we have accessed the debt markets for significant amounts of capital in the past, and expect to continue to be able to access these markets in the future as necessary.\nNet Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities were $297.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to OIBDA of $379.5 million and the $6.9 million net change in our operating assets and liabilities, offset in part by interest expense of $94.7 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to increases in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other current liabilities of $10.2 million, in accounts payable to affiliates of $9.2 million and in deferred revenue of $1.7 million, offset in part by increases in accounts receivable, net, of $10.6 million and in prepaid expenses and other assets of $4.3 million.\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities were $280.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to OIBDA of $369.7 million and the $6.2 million net change in our operating assets and liabilities, offset in part by interest expense of $100.4 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a decline in accounts receivable from affiliates of $4.4 million and increases in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $1.6 million and in accounts payable to affiliates of $1.5 million, offset in part by increases in accounts receivable, net, of $2.8 million.\nNet Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nCapital expenditures continue to be our primary use of capital resources and generally comprise substantially all of our net cash flows used in investing activities.\nNet cash flows used in investing activities were $148.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, comprising $151.2 million of capital expenditures, $1.6 million associated with the acquisition of other intangible assets and $0.7 million of other investing activities, slightly offset in part by a net change in accrued property, plant and equipment of $4.9 million and $0.3 million of proceeds from the sale of assets.\nNet cash flows used in investing activities were $137.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, comprising $137.3 million of capital expenditures and a net change in accrued property, plant and equipment of $0.3 million, offset in part by less than $0.1 million of other investing activities.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe table below sets forth our capital expenditures (dollars in thousands):\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Customer premise equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 80,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 62,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Enterprise networks\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,412\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Scalable infrastructure\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,344\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Line extensions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Upgrade / rebuild\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Support capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 151,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 137,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in capital expenditures largely reflected greater investments associated with the deployment of our advanced customer premise equipment, including our next-generation set-top and, to a lesser extent, the expansion of our fiber network, offset by lower spending on local HSD bandwidth management and, to a lesser extent, reduced outlays for fiber connectivity to cell towers for wireless carriers.\nNet Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities\nNet cash flows used in financing activities were $148.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, comprising $127.3 million of net repayments under the credit facility, $18.0 million of dividend payments on preferred members' interest, $2.3 million of financing costs and $0.4 million of other financing activities.\nNet cash flows used in financing activities were $144.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to $163.3 million of capital distributions to our parent, MCC, net repayments of $151.0 million under the credit facility, $18.0 million of dividend payments on preferred members' interest and $12.5 million of financing costs, offset in part by the $200.0 million issuance of senior notes.\nCapital Structure\nAs of December 31, 2015, our total indebtedness was $1.830 billion, of which approximately 60% was at fixed interest rates or had interest rate exchange agreements that fixed the variable portion of debt. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we paid cash interest of $82.8 million, net of capitalized interest.\n2015 Financing Activity\nOn August 12, 2015 and November 23, 2015, we entered into incremental facility agreements which provided for $25.0 million and $87.5 million of additional revolving credit commitments, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had $368.5 million of revolving credit commitments under our bank credit facility (the credit facility\u201d).\nOn December 17, 2015, we completed a new term loan ( Term Loan A\u201d) in the aggregate principal amount of $151.5 million. After giving effect to $1.7 million of financing costs, net proceeds from Term Loan A, together with borrowings under our revolving credit commitments, were used to repay the entire $194.0 million balance of the previously existing Term Loan G under the credit facility.\nSee Note 6 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBank Credit Facility\nAs of December 31, 2015, we maintained a $1.647 billion credit facility, comprising $1.278 billion of term loans with maturities ranging from June 2017 to June 2021 and $368.5 million of revolving credit commitments, which are scheduled to expire in October 2019. As of the same date, we had $306.6 million of unused lines under our revolving credit commitments, all of which were available to be borrowed and used for general corporate purposes, after giving effect to $51.5 million of outstanding loans and $10.4 million of letters of credit issued thereunder to various parties as collateral.\nThe credit facility is collateralized by our ownership interests in our operating subsidiaries, and is guaranteed by us on a limited recourse basis to the extent of such ownership interests. The credit agreement governing the credit facility (the credit agreement\u201d) requires us to maintain a total leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of no more than 5.0 to 1.0 and an interest coverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of no less than 2.0 to 1.0. For all periods through December 31, 2015, our operating subsidiaries were in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement including, as of the same date, a total leverage ratio of 3.2 to 1.0 and an interest coverage ratio of 3.5 to 1.0. We do not believe that our operating subsidiaries will have any difficulty complying with any of the covenants under the credit agreement in the near future.\nInterest Rate Swaps\nWe have entered into several interest rate exchange agreements (which we refer to as interest rate swaps\u201d) with various banks to fix the variable rate of borrowings to reduce the potential volatility in our interest expense that may result from changes in market interest rates. As December 31, 2015, we had interest rate swaps that fix the variable portion of $600 million of borrowings at a rate of 1.5%, all of which are scheduled to expire during the year ending December 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the weighted average rate on outstanding borrowings under the credit facility, including the effects of these interest rate swaps, was 3.7%.\nSenior Notes\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $500.0 million of outstanding senior notes, comprising $200.0 million of 5\u00bd% senior notes due April 2021 and $300.0 million of 6\u215c% senior notes due April 2023.\nOur senior notes are unsecured obligations, and the indentures governing our senior notes (the indentures\u201d) limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness based upon a maximum debt to operating cash flow ratio (as defined in the indentures) of 8.5 to 1.0. For all periods through December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with covenants under the indentures including, as of the same date, a debt to operating cash flow ratio of 4.5 to 1.0. We do not believe that we will have any difficulty complying with any of the covenants under the indentures in the near future.\nDebt Ratings\nMCC's corporate credit ratings are Ba3 by Moody's, and BB by Standard and Poor's ( S&P\u201d), both with stable outlooks. Our senior unsecured ratings are B2 by Moody's, and B+ by S&P, both with stable outlooks.\nThere can be no assurance that Moody's or S&P will maintain their ratings on MCC and us. A negative change to these credit ratings could result in higher interest rates on future debt issuance than we currently experience, or adversely impact our ability to raise additional funds. There are no covenants, events of default, borrowing conditions or other terms in the credit agreement or indentures that are based on changes in our credit rating assigned by any rating agency.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments, and the effects they are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow, for the five years subsequent to December 31, 2015 and thereafter (dollars in thousands)*:\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Scheduled\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Operating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Purchase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Debt Maturities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Expense (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 74,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 114,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 276,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 136,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 416,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 84,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 119,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 205,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,449,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,502,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cash obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,829,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 382,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,238,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td> *\n</td> <td> Refer to Note 6 and Note 11 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our long-term debt and of our operating leases and other commitments and contingencies, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Interest payments on floating rate debt and interest rate swaps are estimated using amounts outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and the average interest rates applicable under such debt obligations.

There are no programming service amounts included in our purchase obligations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Periodically, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to doubtful accounts, long-lived assets, capitalized costs and accruals. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. For a summary of our accounting policies, see Note 2 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nWe capitalize the costs of new construction and replacement of our cable transmission and distribution facilities and new service installation in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) No. 922 - Entertainment - Cable Television. Costs associated with subsequent installations of additional services not previously installed at a customer's dwelling are capitalized to the extent such costs are incremental and directly attributable to the installation of such additional services. Capitalized costs include all direct labor and materials as well as certain indirect costs. Capitalized costs are recorded as additions to property, plant and equipment and depreciated over the average life of the related assets. We use standard costing models, developed from actual historical costs and relevant operational data, to determine our capitalized amounts. These models include labor rates, overhead rates and standard time inputs to perform various installation and construction activities. The development of these standards involves significant judgment by management, especially in the development of standards for our newer, advanced products and services in which historical data is limited. Changes to the estimates or assumptions used in establishing these standards could be material. We perform periodic evaluations of the estimates used to determine the amount of costs that are capitalized. Any changes to these estimates, which may be significant, are applied in the period in which the evaluations were completed.\nValuation and Impairment Testing of Indefinite-lived Intangibles\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $1.4 billion of unamortized intangible assets, including franchise rights of $1.2 billion and goodwill of $0.2 billion on our consolidated balance sheets. These intangible assets represented approximately 60% of our total assets.\nOur cable systems operate under non-exclusive cable franchises, or franchise rights, granted by state and local governmental authorities for varying lengths of time. We acquired these cable franchises through acquisitions of cable systems and were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. As of December 31, 2015, we held 728 franchises in areas located throughout the United States. The value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market new products and services, such as digital video, HSD and phone, in a specific market territory. We concluded that our franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since, among other things, there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors limiting the period over which these franchise rights contribute to our revenues and cash flows. Goodwill is the excess of the acquisition cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. In accordance with ASC No. 350 - Intangibles - Goodwill and Other ( ASC 350\u201d), we do not amortize franchise rights and goodwill. Instead, such assets are tested annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise.\nWe follow the provisions of ASC 350 to test our goodwill and franchise rights for impairment. We assess the fair values of our reporting unit using the Excess Earnings Method of the Income Approach as our discounted cash flow ( DCF\u201d) methodology, under which the fair value of cable franchise rights are determined in a direct manner. We employ the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method to calculate the fair values of our cable franchise rights, using unobservable inputs (Level 3). This assessment involves significant judgment, including certain assumptions and estimates that determine future cash flow expectations and other future benefits, which are consistent with the expectations of buyers and sellers of cable systems in determining fair value. These assumptions and estimates include discount rates, estimated growth rates, terminal growth rates, revenues per customer, market penetration as a percentage of homes passed and operating margin. We also consider market transactions, market valuations, research analyst estimates and other valuations using multiples of operating income before depreciation and amortization to confirm the reasonableness of fair values determined by the DCF methodology. We also employ the Greenfield model to corroborate the fair values of our cable franchise rights determined under the In-use Excess Earnings DCF methodology. Significant impairment in value resulting in impairment charges may result if the estimates and assumptions used in the fair value determination change in the future. Such impairments, if recognized, could potentially be material.\nBased on the guidance outlined in ASC 350, we have determined that the unit of accounting, or reporting unit, for testing goodwill and franchise rights is Mediacom Broadband. Comprising cable system clusters across several states, Mediacom Broadband is at the financial reporting level that is managed and reviewed by the corporate office (i.e., chief operating decision maker) including our determination as to how we allocate capital resources and utilize the assets. The reporting unit level also reflects the level at which the purchase method of accounting for our acquisitions was originally recorded.\nIn accordance with ASC 350, we are required to determine goodwill impairment using a two-step process. The first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with our carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds our carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds our fair value, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill, calculated using the residual method, with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, the excess is recognized as an impairment loss.\nThe impairment test for our franchise rights and other intangible assets not subject to amortization consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the excess is recognized as an impairment loss.\nSince our adoption of ASC 350 in 2002, we have not recorded any impairments as a result of our impairment testing. We completed our most recent impairment test as of October 1, 2015, which reflected no impairment of our franchise rights, goodwill or other intangible assets.\nFor illustrative purposes, if there were a hypothetical decline of 15% in the fair values determined for cable franchise rights at our reporting unit, an impairment loss of $17.5 million would result as of our impairment testing date of October 1, 2015. In addition, a hypothetical decline of up to 15% in the fair values determined for goodwill and other finite-lived intangible assets at our reporting unit would not result in any impairment loss as of October 1, 2015.\nWe could record impairments in the future if there are changes in the long-term fundamentals of our business, in general market conditions or in the regulatory landscape that could prevent us from recovering the carrying value of our long-lived intangible assets. The economic conditions affecting the U.S. economy, and how that may impact the fundamentals of our business, may have a negative impact on the fair values of the assets in our reporting unit.\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-28 - When to Perform Step 2 of the Goodwill Impairment Test for Reporting Units with Zero or Negative Carrying Amounts (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force), as of October 1, 2015 and 2014, we have evaluated whether there are any adverse qualitative factors surrounding our Mediacom Broadband reporting unit indicating that a goodwill impairment may exist. We do not believe that it is more likely than not\u201d that a goodwill impairment exists. As such, we have not performed Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. As of December 31, 2015, the Mediacom Broadband reporting unit had a positive carrying amount. As of December 31, 2014, the Mediacom Broadband reporting unit had a negative carrying amount.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09\u201d). The guidance states that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. An entity should also disclose sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. This guidance supersedes most industry-specific guidance, including Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 51 - Financial Reporting by Cable Television Companies. In August 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which deferred by one year the effective date of ASU 2014-09 until reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 including interim periods within the reporting period. The FASB is permitting early adoption of the updated accounting guidance, but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the methods of adoption allowed by the new standard and the effect the standard is expected to have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures\nIn April 2015 (as amended in August 2015), the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03 (and ASU 2015-15) - Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-03\u201d). The purpose of this guidance is to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs and requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. For public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. An entity should apply the new guidance on a retrospective basis, wherein the balance sheet of each individual period presented should be adjusted to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new guidance. We expect to reclassify approximately $22.6 million from other assets, net to long-term debt as a result of this new guidance (based upon amounts as of December 31, 2015).\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05 - Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40) ( ASU 2015-05\u201d). The objective of ASU 2015-05 is to address the concerns of stakeholders that the lack of guidance about a customer's accounting for fees in a cloud computing arrangement leads to unnecessary cost and complexity when evaluating the accounting for those fees, as well as some diversity in practice. The amendments in ASU 2015-05 will help entities evaluate the accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement by providing guidance as to whether an arrangement includes the sale or license of software. Examples of cloud computing arrangements include software as a service, platform as a service, infrastructure as a service, and other similar hosting arrangements. This guidance is effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those\nannual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. We have completed our evaluation of this new guidance and determined that there will not be a significant impact to our operations.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 - Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02\u201d). The objective of ASU 2016-02 is to address the concerns to increase the transparency around lease obligations. To address these concerns, previously unrecorded off-balance sheet obligations will now be brought more prominently to light by presenting lease liabilities on the face of the balance sheet. Accompanied by enhanced qualitative and quantitative disclosures in the notes to the financial statements, financial statement users will be able to more accurately compare information from one company to another. This guidance is effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018. We have not completed our evaluation of this new guidance.\nInflation and Changing Prices\nOur costs and expenses are subject to inflation and price fluctuations. Such changes in costs and expenses can generally be passed through to customers. Programming costs have historically increased at rates in excess of inflation and are expected to continue to do so. We believe that under the FCC's existing cable rate regulations we may increase rates for cable services to more than cover any increases in programming. However, competitive conditions and other factors in the marketplace may limit our ability to increase our rates.\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "Phone revenues decreased 4.8%, principally due to lower revenues per residential phone customer, largely a result of greater levels of discounted pricing, offset in part by a higher average residential phone customer base than the prior year.

Marketing costs grew 11.7%, principally due to advertising costs associated with a rebranding campaign, higher business services marketing and greater use of third-party sales services. Bad debt declined 8.0%, substantially due to a lower number of written off accounts. Administrative expenses fell 20.8%, mainly as a result of lower customer service software costs and a decline in legal and other professional fees.

for the year. \nVideo\nWe capitalize the costs of new construction and replacement of our cable transmission and distribution facilities and new service installation in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) No. 922 - Entertainment - Cable Television. Costs associated with subsequent installations of additional services not previously installed at a customer's dwelling are capitalized to the extent such costs are incremental and directly attributable to the installation of such additional services. Capitalized costs include all direct labor and materials as well as certain indirect costs. Capitalized costs are recorded as additions to property, plant and equipment and depreciated over the average life of the related assets. We use standard costing models, developed from actual historical costs and relevant operational data, to determine our capitalized amounts. These models include labor rates, overhead rates and standard time inputs to perform various installation and construction activities. The development of these standards involves significant judgment by management, especially in the development of standards for our newer, advanced products and services in which historical data is limited. Changes to the estimates or assumptions used in establishing these standards could be material. We perform periodic evaluations of the estimates used to determine the amount of costs that are capitalized. Any changes to these estimates, which may be significant, are applied in the period in which the evaluations were completed.\nWe face significant competition in our advertising business from a wide range of national, regional and local competitors. Competition will likely elevate as new formats for advertising are introduced into our markets. We compete for advertising revenues principally against local broadcast stations, national cable and broadcast networks, radio, newspapers, magazines, outdoor display and Internet companies. Due to the strong contributions of political advertising during a national election year, we expect to experience an increase in advertising revenues in 2016.\nCosts and Expenses\nNet cash flows used in investing activities were $148.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, comprising $151.2 million of capital expenditures, $1.6 million associated with the acquisition of other intangible assets and $0.7 million of other investing activities, slightly offset in part by a net change in accrued property, plant and equipment of $4.9 million and $0.3 million of proceeds from the sale of assets.\nNet Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities\nManagement fee expense grew 6.3%, reflecting higher fees charged by MCC. Management fee expense as a percentage of revenues were 1.9% and 1.8% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nOIBDA is one of the primary measures used by management to evaluate our performance and to forecast future results. We believe OIBDA is useful for investors because it enables them to assess our performance in a manner similar to the methods used by management, and provides a measure that can be used to analyze value and compare the companies in the cable industry. A limitation of OIBDA, however, is that it excludes depreciation and amortization, which represents the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our business. Management uses a separate process to budget, measure and evaluate capital expenditures. In addition, OIBDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, which may have different depreciation and amortization policies.\nOur business services largely compete with local phone companies, or local exchange carriers ( LECs\u201d). Our fast-growing cell tower backhaul business primarily competes with LECs. Developments and advancements in products and services by new, emerging companies may intensify competition. We have experienced strong growth rates of business services revenues in the past several years, which we believe will continue.\n</table>\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe credit facility is collateralized by our ownership interests in our operating subsidiaries, and is guaranteed by us on a limited recourse basis to the extent of such ownership interests. The credit agreement governing the credit facility (the credit agreement\u201d) requires us to maintain a total leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of no more than 5.0 to 1.0 and an interest coverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of no less than 2.0 to 1.0. For all periods through December 31, 2015, our operating subsidiaries were in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement including, as of the same date, a total leverage ratio of 3.2 to 1.0 and an interest coverage ratio of 3.5 to 1.0. We do not believe that our operating subsidiaries will have any difficulty complying with any of the covenants under the credit agreement in the near future.\nOver the past several years, losses in our residential video customer base have been primarily responsible for slower growth in our residential revenues, while we have rapidly increased our business services revenues through customer gains. We expect to continue to grow revenues through customer additions in business services and, to a lesser extent, in residential services. Business services revenues are expected to grow through HSD and phone sales to SMBs and a greater number of cell tower backhaul sites and large enterprise customers. Revenues from residential services are expected to grow as a result of HSD and phone customer growth, with gains in revenue per PSU, as more customers take higher HSD tiers and advanced video services.\nThe tables below set forth our consolidated statements of operations and OIBDA for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands and percentage changes that are not meaningful are marked NM):\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nOn August 12, 2015 and November 23, 2015, we entered into incremental facility agreements that provided for $25.0 million and $87.5 million of additional revolving credit commitments, respectively.\nAdvertising\nOur net cash flows provided by operating activities are primarily used to fund investments to enhance the capacity and reliability of our network and further expand our products and services, as well as for repayments of our indebtedness and periodic distributions to MCC. As of December 31, 2015, our near-term liquidity requirements included scheduled term loan principal repayments of $19.1 million for the year ending December 31, 2016. As of the same date, our sources of liquidity included $10.4 million of cash and $306.6 million of unused and available commitments under our $368.5 million revolving credit facility, after giving effect to $51.5 million of outstanding loans and $10.4 million of letters of credit issued to various parties as collateral.\nPhone\nSee Note 6 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nManagement fee expense grew 7.6%, reflecting higher fees charged by MCC. Management fee expense as a percentage of revenues were 1.9% for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nOther expense, net, was $1.4 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015, other expense, net, comprised $1.2 million of revolving credit commitment fees and $0.6 million of other fees, offset in part by $0.4 million of rental income. During the year ended December 31, 2014, other expense, net, comprised $1.4 million of revolving credit commitment fees and $0.3 million of other fees, offset in part by $0.4 million of rental income.\nNet Income\nCapital expenditures continue to be our primary use of capital resources and generally comprise substantially all of our net cash flows used in investing activities.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the weighted average rate on outstanding borrowings under the credit facility, including the effects of these interest rate swaps, was 3.7%.\nOIBDA should not be regarded as an alternative to operating income or net income as an indicator of operating performance, or to the statement of cash flows as a measure of liquidity, nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe that operating income is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to OIBDA.\n\nManagement Fee Expense\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities were $297.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to OIBDA of $379.5 million and the $6.9 million net change in our operating assets and liabilities, offset in part by interest expense of $94.7 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to increases in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other current liabilities of $10.2 million, in accounts payable to affiliates of $9.2 million and in deferred revenue of $1.7 million, offset in part by increases in accounts receivable, net, of $10.6 million and in prepaid expenses and other assets of $4.3 million.\nThe impairment test for our franchise rights and other intangible assets not subject to amortization consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the excess is recognized as an impairment loss.\nInterest expense, net, decreased 5.7%, principally due to a lower average cost of debt, offset in part by higher average outstanding indebtedness.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nOIBDA\u201d is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) in the United States. We define OIBDA as operating income before depreciation and amortization. OIBDA has inherent limitations as discussed below.\nNet cash flows used in investing activities were $137.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, comprising $137.3 million of capital expenditures and a net change in accrued property, plant and equipment of $0.3 million, offset in part by less than $0.1 million of other investing activities.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $500.0 million of outstanding senior notes, comprising $200.0 million of 51\u20442% senior notes due April 2021 and $300.0 million of 63\u20448% senior notes due April 2023.\nHistorically, video programming has been our single largest expense, and we have experienced substantial increases in video programming costs per video customer, particularly for sports and local broadcast programming, well in excess of the inflation rate or the change in the consumer price index. We believe these expenses will continue to grow at a high single- to low double-digit rate because of the demands of large media conglomerates or other owners of most of the popular cable networks and major market local broadcast stations, and of large independent television broadcast groups, who own or control a significant number of local broadcast stations across the country and, in some cases, own, control or otherwise represent multiple stations in the same market. Moreover, many of those powerful owners of programming require us to purchase their networks and stations in bundles and effectively dictate how we offer them to our customers, given the contractual economic penalties if we fail to comply. Consequently, we have little or no ability to individually or selectively negotiate for networks or stations, to forego purchasing networks or stations that generate low customer interest, to offer sports programming services, such as ESPN and regional sports networks, on one or more separate tiers, or to offer networks or stations on an a la carte basis to give our customers more choice and potentially lower their costs. In many instances, such programmers have created additional networks and migrated popular programming, particularly sports programming, to these new networks, which has contributed to the increases in our programming costs. Additionally, we believe certain programmers may also demand higher fees from us in an effort to partially offset declines in their advertising revenue as more advertisers allocate a greater portion of their spending to Internet advertising. While such growth in programming expenses can be offset, in whole or in part, by rate increases, we expect our video gross margins will continue to decline if increases in programming costs outpace any growth in video revenues.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nHSD\nBusiness Services\nAs of December 31, 2015, we maintained a $1.647 billion credit facility, comprising $1.278 billion of term loans with maturities ranging from June 2017 to June 2021 and $368.5 million of revolving credit commitments, which are scheduled to expire in October 2019. As of the same date, we had $306.6 million of unused lines under our revolving credit commitments, all of which were available to be borrowed and used for general corporate purposes, after giving effect to $51.5 million of outstanding loans and $10.4 million of letters of credit issued thereunder to various parties as collateral.\nOther expense, net, was $1.3 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2014, other expense, net, comprised $1.4 million of revolving credit commitment fees and $0.3 million of other fees, offset in part by $0.4 million of rental income. During the year ended December 31, 2013, other expense, net, consisted of $1.0 million of revolving credit commitment fees and $0.8 million of other fees.\nOverview\nOur residential phone service mainly competes with substantially comparable phone services offered by local telephone companies and cellular phone services offered by national wireless providers. We believe we will grow phone revenues through residential phone customer growth, which may be mostly offset by unit pricing pressure.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSenior Notes\nWe believe that cash generated by, or available to, us will be sufficient to meet our other anticipated capital and liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months. In the longer term, we may not generate sufficient net cash flows from operations to fund our maturing term loans and senior notes. If we are unable to obtain sufficient future financing on acceptable terms, or at all, we may need to take other actions to conserve or raise capital that we would not take otherwise. However, we have accessed the debt markets for significant amounts of capital in the past, and expect to continue to be able to access these markets in the future as necessary.\n \nVideo\nOur residential video service principally competes with direct broadcast satellite ( DBS\u201d) providers, who offer video programming substantially similar to ours. Over the past several years, we have experienced meaningful video customer losses, as DBS competitors have deployed aggressive marketing campaigns, including deeply discounted promotional packages, more advanced customer premise equipment and exclusive sports programming. We also have placed a greater emphasis on higher quality customer relationships in our residential services, as we have generally eliminated or reduced tactical discounts for customers not likely to purchase two or more services or to stay with us for an extended period, which may further contribute to video customer declines. Our next-generation, multi-room set-top gives customers the same stored content on multiple televisions in their home and a cloud-based, graphically-rich TiVo guide, with Netflix, YouTube, Pandora and other popular apps, advanced search functionality, in-home video streaming to personal devices and the ability to download certain content to their mobile devices for viewing outside of their home. We believe our video strategy may enable us to reduce video customer losses and regain market share of new connects. If we are unsuccessful with this strategy and cannot offset video customer losses through higher average unit pricing and greater penetration of our advanced video services, we may experience future annual declines in video revenues.\nNet cash flows used in financing activities were $144.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to $163.3 million of capital distributions to our parent, MCC, net repayments of $151.0 million under the credit facility, $18.0 million of dividend payments on preferred members' interest and $12.5 million of financing costs, offset in part by the $200.0 million issuance of senior notes.\nPhone revenues decreased 3.8%, principally due to lower revenues per residential phone customer. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we gained 11,000 phone customers, compared to an increase of 17,000 phone customers in the prior year. As of December 31, 2014, we served 218,000 phone customers, or 14.5% of our estimated homes passed.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments, and the effects they are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow, for the five years subsequent to December 31, 2015 and thereafter (dollars in thousands)*:\nOther Expense, Net\nGain on Derivatives, Net\nOur recent performance has been adversely affected by tepid economic growth in the post-recession period and significant video competition. We believe the historically slower economic recovery from the recession, including the uneven gains in household income, occupied housing, and new housing starts, has largely contributed to lower sales and connect activity for all of our residential services and negatively impacted our residential customer and revenue growth. While we expect improvement if and when the economy strengthens further, a continuation or broadening of such effects may adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nService costs consist of the costs related to providing and maintaining services to our customers. Significant service costs comprise: video programming; HSD service, including bandwidth connectivity; phone service, including leased circuits and long distance; our enterprise networks business, including leased access; technical personnel who maintain the cable network, perform customer installation activities and provide customer support; network operations center; utilities, including pole rental; and field operations, including outside contractors, vehicle fuel and maintenance and leased fiber for regional connectivity.\nThe following represents a reconciliation of OIBDA to operating income, which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP measure (dollars in thousands):\nWe follow the provisions of ASC 350 to test our goodwill and franchise rights for impairment. We assess the fair values of our reporting unit using the Excess Earnings Method of the Income Approach as our discounted cash flow ( DCF\u201d) methodology, under which the fair value of cable franchise rights are determined in a direct manner. We employ the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method to calculate the fair values of our cable franchise rights, using unobservable inputs (Level 3). This assessment involves significant judgment, including certain assumptions and estimates that determine future cash flow expectations and other future benefits, which are consistent with the expectations of buyers and sellers of cable systems in determining fair value. These assumptions and estimates include discount rates, estimated growth rates, terminal growth rates, revenues per customer, market penetration as a percentage of homes passed and operating margin. We also consider market transactions, market valuations, research analyst estimates and other valuations using multiples of operating income before depreciation and amortization to confirm the reasonableness of fair values determined by the DCF methodology. We also employ the Greenfield model to corroborate the fair values of our cable franchise rights determined under the In-use Excess Earnings DCF methodology. Significant impairment in value resulting in impairment charges may result if the estimates and assumptions used in the fair value determination change in the future. Such impairments, if recognized, could potentially be material.\nRevenues grew 3.2%, due to greater HSD, business services and, to a lesser extent, advertising revenues, offset in part by lower video and, to a lesser extent, phone revenues compared to the prior year.\nService costs increased 4.3%, largely a result of greater programming, employee and field operating costs. Programming expenses grew 2.0%, primarily due to greater retransmission consent fees charged for local broadcast stations and, to a lesser extent, higher contractual rates charged by our programming vendors for their cable networks, offset in part by a lower average video customer base. Employee costs were 8.3% higher, largely a result of the re-designation of certain business services employees previously included in selling, general, and administrative expenses. Field operating costs rose 8.3%, principally due to a greater use of outside contractors for customer installations. HSD expenses rose 23.1%, mainly due to a greater number of equipment maintenance contracts, higher bandwidth consumption by our HSD customers, and greater costs associated with our enterprise networks business. Service costs as a percentage of revenues were 40.2% and 39.8% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nVideo revenues primarily represent monthly subscription fees charged to residential customers, which vary according to the level of service and equipment taken, and revenue from the sale of VOD content and pay-per-view events. Video revenues also include installation, reconnection and wire maintenance fees, franchise and late payment fees, and other ancillary revenues.\nSince our adoption of ASC 350 in 2002, we have not recorded any impairments as a result of our impairment testing. We completed our most recent impairment test as of October 1, 2015, which reflected no impairment of our franchise rights, goodwill or other intangible assets.\nProgramming costs, which are generally paid on a per video customer basis, have historically represented our single largest expense. In recent years, we have experienced substantial increases in the per-unit cost of programming, which we believe will continue to grow due to the increasing contractual rates and retransmission consent fees demanded by large programmers and independent broadcasters. Our HSD costs fluctuate depending on customers' bandwidth consumption and customer growth. Phone service costs are mainly determined by network configuration, customers' long distance usage and net termination payments to other carriers. Our other service costs generally rise as a result of customer growth and inflationary cost increases for personnel, outside vendors and other expenses. Personnel and related support costs may increase as the percentage of expenses that we capitalize declines due to lower levels of new service installations. We anticipate that service costs, with the exception of programming expenses, will remain fairly consistent as a percentage of our revenues.\nService costs and selling, general and administrative expenses exclude depreciation and amortization, which we present separately.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\nBusiness services revenues primarily represent monthly fees charged to SMBs for video, HSD and phone services, which vary according to the level of service taken, and fees charged to large businesses, including revenues from cell tower backhaul and enterprise class services.\nCosts and Expenses\nOur cable systems operate under non-exclusive cable franchises, or franchise rights, granted by state and local governmental authorities for varying lengths of time. We acquired these cable franchises through acquisitions of cable systems and were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. As of December 31, 2015, we held 728 franchises in areas located throughout the United States. The value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market new products and services, such as digital video, HSD and phone, in a specific market territory. We concluded that our franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since, among other things, there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors limiting the period over which these franchise rights contribute to our revenues and cash flows. Goodwill is the excess of the acquisition cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. In accordance with ASC No. 350 - Intangibles - Goodwill and Other ( ASC 350\u201d), we do not amortize franchise rights and goodwill. Instead, such assets are tested annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise.\nOIBDA grew 5.2%, as the increase in revenues and, to a much lesser extent, the decline in selling, general, and administrative expenses, were offset in part by greater service costs and, to a much lesser extent, management fee expense.\nRevenues were 3.6% higher, due to greater HSD and, to a lesser extent, business services and video revenues, offset in part by declines in advertising and, to a lesser extent, phone revenues compared to the prior year.\nDepreciation and amortization was 1.9% lower, as certain assets becoming fully depreciated was mostly offset by the depreciation of investments in customer premise equipment and our business services offerings.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSee Note 9 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBusiness Services\nAdvertising\nInterest Rate Swaps\nManagement fee expense reflects compensation paid to MCC for the performance of services it provides our operating subsidiaries in accordance with management agreements between MCC and our operating subsidiaries.\n\n * Refer to Note 6 and Note 11 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our long-term debt and of our operating leases and other commitments and contingencies, respectively. \n\nManagement Fee Expense\nNet Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities\nVideo revenues declined 1.6%, mainly due to a lower average residential video customer base than the prior year, largely offset by rate adjustments and, to a lesser extent, greater installation fee revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we lost 28,000 video customers, compared to a loss of 30,000 video customers in the prior year. As of December 31, 2014, we served 500,000 video customers, or 33.4% of our estimated homes passed.\nHSD\nWe have entered into several interest rate exchange agreements (which we refer to as interest rate swaps\u201d) with various banks to fix the variable rate of borrowings to reduce the potential volatility in our interest expense that may result from changes in market interest rates. As December 31, 2015, we had interest rate swaps that fix the variable portion of $600 million of borrowings at a rate of 1.5%, all of which are scheduled to expire during the year ending December 31, 2018.\nThere can be no assurance that Moody's or S&P will maintain their ratings on MCC and us. A negative change to these credit ratings could result in higher interest rates on future debt issuance than we currently experience, or adversely impact our ability to raise additional funds. There are no covenants, events of default, borrowing conditions or other terms in the credit agreement or indentures that are based on changes in our credit rating assigned by any rating agency.\n\nWe are a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mediacom Communications Corporation ( MCC\u201d), the nation's eighth largest cable company based on the number of customers who purchase one or more video services, also known as video customers. As of December 31, 2015, we served approximately 480,000 video customers, 605,000 high-speed data ( HSD\u201d) customers and 239,000 phone customers, aggregating 1.32 million primary service units ( PSUs\u201d). As of the same date, we served 732,000 residential and business customer relationships.\nAdvertising revenues primarily represent revenues received from selling advertising time we receive under programming license agreements to local, regional and national advertisers for the placement of commercials on channels offered on our video services.\n\nOn August 12, 2015 and November 23, 2015, we entered into incremental facility agreements which provided for $25.0 million and $87.5 million of additional revolving credit commitments, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had $368.5 million of revolving credit commitments under our bank credit facility (the credit facility\u201d).\nIn April 2015 (as amended in August 2015), the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03 (and ASU 2015-15) - Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-03\u201d). The purpose of this guidance is to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs and requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. For public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. An entity should apply the new guidance on a retrospective basis, wherein the balance sheet of each individual period presented should be adjusted to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new guidance. We expect to reclassify approximately $22.6 million from other assets, net to long-term debt as a result of this new guidance (based upon amounts as of December 31, 2015).\nNet Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities\n (2) We have contracts with programmers who provide video programming services to our customers. Our contracts typically provide that we have an obligation to purchase video programming for our customers as long as we deliver cable services to such customers. We have no obligation to purchase these services if we are not providing cable services, except when we do not have the right to cancel the underlying contract or for contracts with a guaranteed minimum commitment. There are no programming service amounts included in our purchase obligations. \nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td>\nRevenues\nBusiness services revenues rose 11.6%, mainly as a result of a higher average SMB customer base than the prior year.\nVideo revenues increased 0.5%, mainly due to rate adjustments associated with the pass-through of higher programming costs for retransmission consent fees and, to a lesser extent, for regional sports networks, mostly offset by a lower average residential video customer base than the prior year. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we lost 20,000 video customers, compared to a loss of 28,000 video customers in the prior year. As of December 31, 2015, we served 480,000 video customers, or 32.1% of our estimated homes passed.\nBusiness services revenues grew 14.1%, mainly as a result of a higher average SMB customer base than the prior year and, to a much lesser extent, greater cell tower backhaul revenues.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nWe offer video, HSD and phone services to residential and small- to medium-sized business ( SMB\u201d) customers over our hybrid fiber and coaxial cable network. We believe our customers prefer the cost savings of the bundled services we offer, as well as the convenience of having a single provider contact for ordering, provisioning, billing and customer care. We also provide network and transport services to medium- and large sized businesses, governments, and educational institutions in our service areas, including cell tower backhaul for wireless telephone providers, and sell advertising time to local, regional and national advertisers.\nAs a result of the factors described above, we recognized net income of $137.4 million and $118.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nDebt Ratings\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe table below sets forth our consolidated statements of operations and OIBDA for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands and percentage changes that are not meaningful are marked NM):\nInterest Expense, Net\nAs of December 31, 2015, our total indebtedness was $1.830 billion, of which approximately 60% was at fixed interest rates or had interest rate exchange agreements that fixed the variable portion of debt. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we paid cash interest of $82.8 million, net of capitalized interest.\n\nAs a result of the factors described above, we recognized net income of $144.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $137.4 million in the prior year.\nOperating Income\nOur senior notes are unsecured obligations, and the indentures governing our senior notes (the indentures\u201d) limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness based upon a maximum debt to operating cash flow ratio (as defined in the indentures) of 8.5 to 1.0. For all periods through December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with covenants under the indentures including, as of the same date, a debt to operating cash flow ratio of 4.5 to 1.0. We do not believe that we will have any difficulty complying with any of the covenants under the indentures in the near future.\nThe tables below set forth revenue and selected customer and average monthly revenue statistics as of, and for the years ended, December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands, except per unit data):\nWe could record impairments in the future if there are changes in the long-term fundamentals of our business, in general market conditions or in the regulatory landscape that could prevent us from recovering the carrying value of our long-lived intangible assets. The economic conditions affecting the U.S. economy, and how that may impact the fundamentals of our business, may have a negative impact on the fair values of the assets in our reporting unit.\nOperating income rose 10.9%, predominantly due to the growth in OIBDA and, to a much lesser extent, lower depreciation and amortization.\n</td> </tr>\nInterest expense, net, increased 4.4%, principally due to a higher average cost of debt, offset in part by lower average outstanding indebtedness.\nAdvertising revenues fell 14.8%, substantially due to lower levels of political advertising compared to the prior year that had strong levels of political advertising associated with national elections.\nAdvertising\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities were $280.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to OIBDA of $369.7 million and the $6.2 million net change in our operating assets and liabilities, offset in part by interest expense of $100.4 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a decline in accounts receivable from affiliates of $4.4 million and increases in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $1.6 million and in accounts payable to affiliates of $1.5 million, offset in part by increases in accounts receivable, net, of $2.8 million.\nOur residential HSD service competes primarily with digital subscriber line ( DSL\u201d) services offered by local telephone companies. Based upon the speeds we offer, we believe our HSD service is generally superior to DSL offerings in our service areas. As consumers' bandwidth requirements have dramatically increased in the past few years, a trend many industry experts expect to continue, we believe our ability to offer a HSD service today with downstream speeds of up to 150Mbps gives us a competitive advantage compared to the DSL service offered by the local telephone companies. We expect to continue to grow HSD revenues through residential customer growth and more customers taking higher HSD speed tiers.\nHSD revenues grew 7.4%, predominantly due to a higher average residential HSD customer base than the prior year and more customers taking faster speed tiers. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we gained 30,000 HSD customers, compared to an increase of 29,000 HSD customers in the prior year. As of December 31, 2014, we served 564,000 HSD customers, or 37.6% of our estimated homes passed.\nOperating income rose 8.8%, as a result of lower depreciation and amortization and the growth in OIBDA.\nVideo\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nAs a result of changes to the mark-to-market valuation of our interest rate swaps, based on information provided by our counterparties, we recorded net gains on derivatives of $9.2 million and $23.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n2015 Financing Activity\nPhone\nService Costs\nService costs increased 5.4%, predominantly due to greater video programming expenses. Programming expenses grew 7.8%, primarily due to higher fees associated with the renewal of programming contracts for certain sports and other popular cable networks and for local broadcast stations, and contractual increases under existing carriage agreements, offset in part by a lower average video customer base since the prior year. Service costs as a percentage of revenues were 40.9% and 40.2% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCapital Structure\nITEM 7.\nBased on the guidance outlined in ASC 350, we have determined that the unit of accounting, or reporting unit, for testing goodwill and franchise rights is Mediacom Broadband. Comprising cable system clusters across several states, Mediacom Broadband is at the financial reporting level that is managed and reviewed by the corporate office (i.e., chief operating decision maker) including our determination as to how we allocate capital resources and utilize the assets. The reporting unit level also reflects the level at which the purchase method of accounting for our acquisitions was originally recorded.\nRevenues\nReference is made to the Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations and any of our forward-looking statements contained herein. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements as of, and for the years ended, December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nThe increase in capital expenditures largely reflected greater investments associated with the deployment of our advanced customer premise equipment, including our next-generation set-top and, to a lesser extent, the expansion of our fiber network, offset by lower spending on local HSD bandwidth management and, to a lesser extent, reduced outlays for fiber connectivity to cell towers for wireless carriers.\nCosts and Expenses\nPhone revenues primarily represent monthly subscription fees and equipment charged to residential customers for our phone service.\nOn December 17, 2015, we completed a new term loan ( Term Loan A\u201d) in the aggregate principal amount of $151.5 million. After giving effect to $1.7 million of financing costs, net proceeds from Term Loan A, together with borrowings under our revolving credit commitments, were used to repay the entire $194.0 million balance of the previously existing Term Loan G under the credit facility.\nBusiness Services\n (1) Represents average total monthly revenues for the year divided by average customer relationships for the year. \nThe preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Periodically, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to doubtful accounts, long-lived assets, capitalized costs and accruals. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. For a summary of our accounting policies, see Note 2 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nService Costs\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt totaled $0.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which represented the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs as a result of the repayment of certain term loans under our bank credit facility.\nGain on Derivatives, Net\nOIBDA\nThe tables below set forth revenue and selected customer and average monthly revenue statistics as of, and for the years ended, December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands, except per unit data):\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt totaled $4.4 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which represented the write-off of unamortized financing costs as a result of the repayment of certain previously existing term loans under our bank credit facility.\nOperating Income\nPhone\nAs a result of changes to the mark-to-market valuation of these interest rate swaps, based on information provided by our counterparties, we recorded net gains on derivatives of $23.2 million and $22.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nService Costs\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-28 - When to Perform Step 2 of the Goodwill Impairment Test for Reporting Units with Zero or Negative Carrying Amounts (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force), as of October 1, 2015 and 2014, we have evaluated whether there are any adverse qualitative factors surrounding our Mediacom Broadband reporting unit indicating that a goodwill impairment may exist. We do not believe that it is more likely than not\u201d that a goodwill impairment exists. As such, we have not performed Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. As of December 31, 2015, the Mediacom Broadband reporting unit had a positive carrying amount. As of December 31, 2014, the Mediacom Broadband reporting unit had a negative carrying amount.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09\u201d). The guidance states that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. An entity should also disclose sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. This guidance supersedes most industry-specific guidance, including Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 51 - Financial Reporting by Cable Television Companies. In August 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which deferred by one year the effective date of ASU 2014-09 until reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 including interim periods within the reporting period. The FASB is permitting early adoption of the updated accounting guidance, but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the methods of adoption allowed by the new standard and the effect the standard is expected to have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures\nValuation and Impairment Testing of Indefinite-lived Intangibles\nDepreciation and amortization was 6.0% lower, mainly due to older network assets becoming fully depreciated, offset in part by greater depreciation of customer premise equipment and investments in HSD bandwidth expansion and business support.\n2015 Financing Activity\nHSD revenues grew 11.1%, predominantly due to a higher average residential HSD customer base than the prior year and greater rates per residential HSD customer, largely a result of more customers taking faster speed tiers. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we gained 41,000 HSD customers, compared to a gain of 30,000 HSD customers in the prior year. As of December 31, 2015, we served 605,000 HSD customers, or 40.4% of our estimated homes passed.\nAdvertising revenues rose 14.8%, primarily due to greater levels of political advertising compared to the prior year.\nFor illustrative purposes, if there were a hypothetical decline of 15% in the fair values determined for cable franchise rights at our reporting unit, an impairment loss of $17.5 million would result as of our impairment testing date of October 1, 2015. In addition, a hypothetical decline of up to 15% in the fair values determined for goodwill and other finite-lived intangible assets at our reporting unit would not result in any impairment loss as of October 1, 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $1.4 billion of unamortized intangible assets, including franchise rights of $1.2 billion and goodwill of $0.2 billion on our consolidated balance sheets. These intangible assets represented approximately 60% of our total assets.\n (1) Interest payments on floating rate debt and interest rate swaps are estimated using amounts outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and the average interest rates applicable under such debt obligations. Interest expense amounts are net of amounts capitalized. \nDepreciation and Amortization\nOIBDA\nHSD revenues primarily represent monthly subscription fees charged to residential customers, which vary according to the level of service and equipment taken.\nNet Income\nNet cash flows used in financing activities were $148.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, comprising $127.3 million of net repayments under the credit facility, $18.0 million of dividend payments on preferred members' interest, $2.3 million of financing costs and $0.4 million of other financing activities.\nThe table below represents a reconciliation of OIBDA to operating income, which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP measure (dollars in thousands):\nOn December 17, 2015, we completed a new term loan ( Term Loan A\u201d) in the aggregate principal amount of $151.5 million, and used the net proceeds from Term Loan A, together with borrowings under our revolving credit commitments, to repay the entire $194.0 million balance of Term Loan G.\nSee Notes 4 and 6 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSignificant selling, general and administrative expenses comprise: call center, customer service, marketing, business services, support and administrative personnel; franchise fees and other taxes; bad debt; billing; marketing; advertising; and general office administration. These expenses generally rise due to customer growth and inflationary cost increases for personnel, outside vendors and other expenses. We anticipate that selling, general and administrative expenses will remain fairly consistent as a percentage of our revenues.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 - Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02\u201d). The objective of ASU 2016-02 is to address the concerns to increase the transparency around lease obligations. To address these concerns, previously unrecorded off-balance sheet obligations will now be brought more prominently to light by presenting lease liabilities on the face of the balance sheet. Accompanied by enhanced qualitative and quantitative disclosures in the notes to the financial statements, financial statement users will be able to more accurately compare information from one company to another. This guidance is effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018. We have not completed our evaluation of this new guidance.\nBank Credit Facility\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased 2.8%, largely as a result of lower employee costs, taxes and fees, and office expenses. Employee expenses were 6.7% lower, mainly as a result of the re-designation of certain business services employees previously included in selling, general, and administrative costs. Taxes and fees declined 9.0%, chiefly due to lower franchise fees and, to a lesser extent, property taxes. Office expenses fell 13.8% primarily due to lower rent and telecommunications costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 19.0% and 20.2% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nThe table below sets forth our capital expenditures (dollars in thousands):\nOther Expense, Net\nHSD\nIn accordance with ASC 350, we are required to determine goodwill impairment using a two-step process. The first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with our carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds our carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds our fair value, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill, calculated using the residual method, with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, the excess is recognized as an impairment loss.\nInflation and Changing Prices\nSee Liquidity and Capital Resources - Capital Structure - 2015 Financing Activity\u201d and Note 6 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05 - Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40) ( ASU 2015-05\u201d). The objective of ASU 2015-05 is to address the concerns of stakeholders that the lack of guidance about a customer's accounting for fees in a cloud computing arrangement leads to unnecessary cost and complexity when evaluating the accounting for those fees, as well as some diversity in practice. The amendments in ASU 2015-05 will help entities evaluate the accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement by providing guidance as to whether an arrangement includes the sale or license of software. Examples of cloud computing arrangements include software as a service, platform as a service, infrastructure as a service, and other similar hosting arrangements. This guidance is effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOIBDA grew 2.6%, primarily due to the increase in revenues, offset in part by higher programming costs.\nMCC's corporate credit ratings are Ba3 by Moody's, and BB by Standard and Poor's ( S&P\u201d), both with stable outlooks. Our senior unsecured ratings are B2 by Moody's, and B+ by S&P, both with stable outlooks.", "item_7_text": "Phone revenues decreased 4.8%, principally due to lower revenues per residential phone customer, largely a result of greater levels of discounted pricing, offset in part by a higher average residential phone customer base than the prior year. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we gained 21,000 phone customers, compared to a gain of 11,000 phone customers in the prior year. As of December 31, 2015, we served 239,000 phone customers, or 16.0% of our estimated homes passed.\nManagement Fee Expense\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt\n\n\nInterest Expense, Net\nannual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. We have completed our evaluation of this new guidance and determined that there will not be a significant impact to our operations.\nOur costs and expenses are subject to inflation and price fluctuations. Such changes in costs and expenses can generally be passed through to customers. Programming costs have historically increased at rates in excess of inflation and are expected to continue to do so. We believe that under the FCC's existing cable rate regulations we may increase rates for cable services to more than cover any increases in programming. However, competitive conditions and other factors in the marketplace may limit our ability to increase our rates.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 1.1%, largely as a result of greater marketing costs, offset in part by lower bad debt and administrative expenses. Marketing costs grew 11.7%, principally due to advertising costs associated with a rebranding campaign, higher business services marketing and greater use of third-party sales services. Bad debt declined 8.0%, substantially due to a lower number of written off accounts. Administrative expenses fell 20.8%, mainly as a result of lower customer service software costs and a decline in legal and other professional fees. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 18.5% and 19.0% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nRevenues\nCapital Expenditures\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n (1) Represents average total monthly revenues for the year divided by average customer relationships for the year. \nVideo\nWe capitalize the costs of new construction and replacement of our cable transmission and distribution facilities and new service installation in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) No. 922 - Entertainment - Cable Television. Costs associated with subsequent installations of additional services not previously installed at a customer's dwelling are capitalized to the extent such costs are incremental and directly attributable to the installation of such additional services. Capitalized costs include all direct labor and materials as well as certain indirect costs. Capitalized costs are recorded as additions to property, plant and equipment and depreciated over the average life of the related assets. We use standard costing models, developed from actual historical costs and relevant operational data, to determine our capitalized amounts. These models include labor rates, overhead rates and standard time inputs to perform various installation and construction activities. The development of these standards involves significant judgment by management, especially in the development of standards for our newer, advanced products and services in which historical data is limited. Changes to the estimates or assumptions used in establishing these standards could be material. We perform periodic evaluations of the estimates used to determine the amount of costs that are capitalized. Any changes to these estimates, which may be significant, are applied in the period in which the evaluations were completed.\nWe face significant competition in our advertising business from a wide range of national, regional and local competitors. Competition will likely elevate as new formats for advertising are introduced into our markets. We compete for advertising revenues principally against local broadcast stations, national cable and broadcast networks, radio, newspapers, magazines, outdoor display and Internet companies. Due to the strong contributions of political advertising during a national election year, we expect to experience an increase in advertising revenues in 2016.\nCosts and Expenses\nNet cash flows used in investing activities were $148.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, comprising $151.2 million of capital expenditures, $1.6 million associated with the acquisition of other intangible assets and $0.7 million of other investing activities, slightly offset in part by a net change in accrued property, plant and equipment of $4.9 million and $0.3 million of proceeds from the sale of assets.\nNet Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities\nManagement fee expense grew 6.3%, reflecting higher fees charged by MCC. Management fee expense as a percentage of revenues were 1.9% and 1.8% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nOIBDA is one of the primary measures used by management to evaluate our performance and to forecast future results. We believe OIBDA is useful for investors because it enables them to assess our performance in a manner similar to the methods used by management, and provides a measure that can be used to analyze value and compare the companies in the cable industry. A limitation of OIBDA, however, is that it excludes depreciation and amortization, which represents the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our business. Management uses a separate process to budget, measure and evaluate capital expenditures. In addition, OIBDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, which may have different depreciation and amortization policies.\nOur business services largely compete with local phone companies, or local exchange carriers ( LECs\u201d). Our fast-growing cell tower backhaul business primarily competes with LECs. Developments and advancements in products and services by new, emerging companies may intensify competition. We have experienced strong growth rates of business services revenues in the past several years, which we believe will continue.\n</table>\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe credit facility is collateralized by our ownership interests in our operating subsidiaries, and is guaranteed by us on a limited recourse basis to the extent of such ownership interests. The credit agreement governing the credit facility (the credit agreement\u201d) requires us to maintain a total leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of no more than 5.0 to 1.0 and an interest coverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of no less than 2.0 to 1.0. For all periods through December 31, 2015, our operating subsidiaries were in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement including, as of the same date, a total leverage ratio of 3.2 to 1.0 and an interest coverage ratio of 3.5 to 1.0. We do not believe that our operating subsidiaries will have any difficulty complying with any of the covenants under the credit agreement in the near future.\nOver the past several years, losses in our residential video customer base have been primarily responsible for slower growth in our residential revenues, while we have rapidly increased our business services revenues through customer gains. We expect to continue to grow revenues through customer additions in business services and, to a lesser extent, in residential services. Business services revenues are expected to grow through HSD and phone sales to SMBs and a greater number of cell tower backhaul sites and large enterprise customers. Revenues from residential services are expected to grow as a result of HSD and phone customer growth, with gains in revenue per PSU, as more customers take higher HSD tiers and advanced video services.\nThe tables below set forth our consolidated statements of operations and OIBDA for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands and percentage changes that are not meaningful are marked NM):\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nOn August 12, 2015 and November 23, 2015, we entered into incremental facility agreements that provided for $25.0 million and $87.5 million of additional revolving credit commitments, respectively.\nAdvertising\nOur net cash flows provided by operating activities are primarily used to fund investments to enhance the capacity and reliability of our network and further expand our products and services, as well as for repayments of our indebtedness and periodic distributions to MCC. As of December 31, 2015, our near-term liquidity requirements included scheduled term loan principal repayments of $19.1 million for the year ending December 31, 2016. As of the same date, our sources of liquidity included $10.4 million of cash and $306.6 million of unused and available commitments under our $368.5 million revolving credit facility, after giving effect to $51.5 million of outstanding loans and $10.4 million of letters of credit issued to various parties as collateral.\nPhone\nSee Note 6 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nManagement fee expense grew 7.6%, reflecting higher fees charged by MCC. Management fee expense as a percentage of revenues were 1.9% for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nOther expense, net, was $1.4 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015, other expense, net, comprised $1.2 million of revolving credit commitment fees and $0.6 million of other fees, offset in part by $0.4 million of rental income. During the year ended December 31, 2014, other expense, net, comprised $1.4 million of revolving credit commitment fees and $0.3 million of other fees, offset in part by $0.4 million of rental income.\nNet Income\nCapital expenditures continue to be our primary use of capital resources and generally comprise substantially all of our net cash flows used in investing activities.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the weighted average rate on outstanding borrowings under the credit facility, including the effects of these interest rate swaps, was 3.7%.\nOIBDA should not be regarded as an alternative to operating income or net income as an indicator of operating performance, or to the statement of cash flows as a measure of liquidity, nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe that operating income is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to OIBDA.\n\nManagement Fee Expense\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities were $297.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to OIBDA of $379.5 million and the $6.9 million net change in our operating assets and liabilities, offset in part by interest expense of $94.7 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to increases in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other current liabilities of $10.2 million, in accounts payable to affiliates of $9.2 million and in deferred revenue of $1.7 million, offset in part by increases in accounts receivable, net, of $10.6 million and in prepaid expenses and other assets of $4.3 million.\nThe impairment test for our franchise rights and other intangible assets not subject to amortization consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the excess is recognized as an impairment loss.\nInterest expense, net, decreased 5.7%, principally due to a lower average cost of debt, offset in part by higher average outstanding indebtedness.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nOIBDA\u201d is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) in the United States. We define OIBDA as operating income before depreciation and amortization. OIBDA has inherent limitations as discussed below.\nNet cash flows used in investing activities were $137.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, comprising $137.3 million of capital expenditures and a net change in accrued property, plant and equipment of $0.3 million, offset in part by less than $0.1 million of other investing activities.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $500.0 million of outstanding senior notes, comprising $200.0 million of 51\u20442% senior notes due April 2021 and $300.0 million of 63\u20448% senior notes due April 2023.\nHistorically, video programming has been our single largest expense, and we have experienced substantial increases in video programming costs per video customer, particularly for sports and local broadcast programming, well in excess of the inflation rate or the change in the consumer price index. We believe these expenses will continue to grow at a high single- to low double-digit rate because of the demands of large media conglomerates or other owners of most of the popular cable networks and major market local broadcast stations, and of large independent television broadcast groups, who own or control a significant number of local broadcast stations across the country and, in some cases, own, control or otherwise represent multiple stations in the same market. Moreover, many of those powerful owners of programming require us to purchase their networks and stations in bundles and effectively dictate how we offer them to our customers, given the contractual economic penalties if we fail to comply. Consequently, we have little or no ability to individually or selectively negotiate for networks or stations, to forego purchasing networks or stations that generate low customer interest, to offer sports programming services, such as ESPN and regional sports networks, on one or more separate tiers, or to offer networks or stations on an a la carte basis to give our customers more choice and potentially lower their costs. In many instances, such programmers have created additional networks and migrated popular programming, particularly sports programming, to these new networks, which has contributed to the increases in our programming costs. Additionally, we believe certain programmers may also demand higher fees from us in an effort to partially offset declines in their advertising revenue as more advertisers allocate a greater portion of their spending to Internet advertising. While such growth in programming expenses can be offset, in whole or in part, by rate increases, we expect our video gross margins will continue to decline if increases in programming costs outpace any growth in video revenues.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nHSD\nBusiness Services\nAs of December 31, 2015, we maintained a $1.647 billion credit facility, comprising $1.278 billion of term loans with maturities ranging from June 2017 to June 2021 and $368.5 million of revolving credit commitments, which are scheduled to expire in October 2019. As of the same date, we had $306.6 million of unused lines under our revolving credit commitments, all of which were available to be borrowed and used for general corporate purposes, after giving effect to $51.5 million of outstanding loans and $10.4 million of letters of credit issued thereunder to various parties as collateral.\nOther expense, net, was $1.3 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2014, other expense, net, comprised $1.4 million of revolving credit commitment fees and $0.3 million of other fees, offset in part by $0.4 million of rental income. During the year ended December 31, 2013, other expense, net, consisted of $1.0 million of revolving credit commitment fees and $0.8 million of other fees.\nOverview\nOur residential phone service mainly competes with substantially comparable phone services offered by local telephone companies and cellular phone services offered by national wireless providers. We believe we will grow phone revenues through residential phone customer growth, which may be mostly offset by unit pricing pressure.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSenior Notes\nWe believe that cash generated by, or available to, us will be sufficient to meet our other anticipated capital and liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months. In the longer term, we may not generate sufficient net cash flows from operations to fund our maturing term loans and senior notes. If we are unable to obtain sufficient future financing on acceptable terms, or at all, we may need to take other actions to conserve or raise capital that we would not take otherwise. However, we have accessed the debt markets for significant amounts of capital in the past, and expect to continue to be able to access these markets in the future as necessary.\n \nVideo\nOur residential video service principally competes with direct broadcast satellite ( DBS\u201d) providers, who offer video programming substantially similar to ours. Over the past several years, we have experienced meaningful video customer losses, as DBS competitors have deployed aggressive marketing campaigns, including deeply discounted promotional packages, more advanced customer premise equipment and exclusive sports programming. We also have placed a greater emphasis on higher quality customer relationships in our residential services, as we have generally eliminated or reduced tactical discounts for customers not likely to purchase two or more services or to stay with us for an extended period, which may further contribute to video customer declines. Our next-generation, multi-room set-top gives customers the same stored content on multiple televisions in their home and a cloud-based, graphically-rich TiVo guide, with Netflix, YouTube, Pandora and other popular apps, advanced search functionality, in-home video streaming to personal devices and the ability to download certain content to their mobile devices for viewing outside of their home. We believe our video strategy may enable us to reduce video customer losses and regain market share of new connects. If we are unsuccessful with this strategy and cannot offset video customer losses through higher average unit pricing and greater penetration of our advanced video services, we may experience future annual declines in video revenues.\nNet cash flows used in financing activities were $144.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to $163.3 million of capital distributions to our parent, MCC, net repayments of $151.0 million under the credit facility, $18.0 million of dividend payments on preferred members' interest and $12.5 million of financing costs, offset in part by the $200.0 million issuance of senior notes.\nPhone revenues decreased 3.8%, principally due to lower revenues per residential phone customer. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we gained 11,000 phone customers, compared to an increase of 17,000 phone customers in the prior year. As of December 31, 2014, we served 218,000 phone customers, or 14.5% of our estimated homes passed.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments, and the effects they are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow, for the five years subsequent to December 31, 2015 and thereafter (dollars in thousands)*:\nOther Expense, Net\nGain on Derivatives, Net\nOur recent performance has been adversely affected by tepid economic growth in the post-recession period and significant video competition. We believe the historically slower economic recovery from the recession, including the uneven gains in household income, occupied housing, and new housing starts, has largely contributed to lower sales and connect activity for all of our residential services and negatively impacted our residential customer and revenue growth. While we expect improvement if and when the economy strengthens further, a continuation or broadening of such effects may adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nService costs consist of the costs related to providing and maintaining services to our customers. Significant service costs comprise: video programming; HSD service, including bandwidth connectivity; phone service, including leased circuits and long distance; our enterprise networks business, including leased access; technical personnel who maintain the cable network, perform customer installation activities and provide customer support; network operations center; utilities, including pole rental; and field operations, including outside contractors, vehicle fuel and maintenance and leased fiber for regional connectivity.\nThe following represents a reconciliation of OIBDA to operating income, which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP measure (dollars in thousands):\nWe follow the provisions of ASC 350 to test our goodwill and franchise rights for impairment. We assess the fair values of our reporting unit using the Excess Earnings Method of the Income Approach as our discounted cash flow ( DCF\u201d) methodology, under which the fair value of cable franchise rights are determined in a direct manner. We employ the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method to calculate the fair values of our cable franchise rights, using unobservable inputs (Level 3). This assessment involves significant judgment, including certain assumptions and estimates that determine future cash flow expectations and other future benefits, which are consistent with the expectations of buyers and sellers of cable systems in determining fair value. These assumptions and estimates include discount rates, estimated growth rates, terminal growth rates, revenues per customer, market penetration as a percentage of homes passed and operating margin. We also consider market transactions, market valuations, research analyst estimates and other valuations using multiples of operating income before depreciation and amortization to confirm the reasonableness of fair values determined by the DCF methodology. We also employ the Greenfield model to corroborate the fair values of our cable franchise rights determined under the In-use Excess Earnings DCF methodology. Significant impairment in value resulting in impairment charges may result if the estimates and assumptions used in the fair value determination change in the future. Such impairments, if recognized, could potentially be material.\nRevenues grew 3.2%, due to greater HSD, business services and, to a lesser extent, advertising revenues, offset in part by lower video and, to a lesser extent, phone revenues compared to the prior year.\nService costs increased 4.3%, largely a result of greater programming, employee and field operating costs. Programming expenses grew 2.0%, primarily due to greater retransmission consent fees charged for local broadcast stations and, to a lesser extent, higher contractual rates charged by our programming vendors for their cable networks, offset in part by a lower average video customer base. Employee costs were 8.3% higher, largely a result of the re-designation of certain business services employees previously included in selling, general, and administrative expenses. Field operating costs rose 8.3%, principally due to a greater use of outside contractors for customer installations. HSD expenses rose 23.1%, mainly due to a greater number of equipment maintenance contracts, higher bandwidth consumption by our HSD customers, and greater costs associated with our enterprise networks business. Service costs as a percentage of revenues were 40.2% and 39.8% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nVideo revenues primarily represent monthly subscription fees charged to residential customers, which vary according to the level of service and equipment taken, and revenue from the sale of VOD content and pay-per-view events. Video revenues also include installation, reconnection and wire maintenance fees, franchise and late payment fees, and other ancillary revenues.\nSince our adoption of ASC 350 in 2002, we have not recorded any impairments as a result of our impairment testing. We completed our most recent impairment test as of October 1, 2015, which reflected no impairment of our franchise rights, goodwill or other intangible assets.\nProgramming costs, which are generally paid on a per video customer basis, have historically represented our single largest expense. In recent years, we have experienced substantial increases in the per-unit cost of programming, which we believe will continue to grow due to the increasing contractual rates and retransmission consent fees demanded by large programmers and independent broadcasters. Our HSD costs fluctuate depending on customers' bandwidth consumption and customer growth. Phone service costs are mainly determined by network configuration, customers' long distance usage and net termination payments to other carriers. Our other service costs generally rise as a result of customer growth and inflationary cost increases for personnel, outside vendors and other expenses. Personnel and related support costs may increase as the percentage of expenses that we capitalize declines due to lower levels of new service installations. We anticipate that service costs, with the exception of programming expenses, will remain fairly consistent as a percentage of our revenues.\nService costs and selling, general and administrative expenses exclude depreciation and amortization, which we present separately.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\nBusiness services revenues primarily represent monthly fees charged to SMBs for video, HSD and phone services, which vary according to the level of service taken, and fees charged to large businesses, including revenues from cell tower backhaul and enterprise class services.\nCosts and Expenses\nOur cable systems operate under non-exclusive cable franchises, or franchise rights, granted by state and local governmental authorities for varying lengths of time. We acquired these cable franchises through acquisitions of cable systems and were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. As of December 31, 2015, we held 728 franchises in areas located throughout the United States. The value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market new products and services, such as digital video, HSD and phone, in a specific market territory. We concluded that our franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since, among other things, there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors limiting the period over which these franchise rights contribute to our revenues and cash flows. Goodwill is the excess of the acquisition cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. In accordance with ASC No. 350 - Intangibles - Goodwill and Other ( ASC 350\u201d), we do not amortize franchise rights and goodwill. Instead, such assets are tested annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise.\nOIBDA grew 5.2%, as the increase in revenues and, to a much lesser extent, the decline in selling, general, and administrative expenses, were offset in part by greater service costs and, to a much lesser extent, management fee expense.\nRevenues were 3.6% higher, due to greater HSD and, to a lesser extent, business services and video revenues, offset in part by declines in advertising and, to a lesser extent, phone revenues compared to the prior year.\nDepreciation and amortization was 1.9% lower, as certain assets becoming fully depreciated was mostly offset by the depreciation of investments in customer premise equipment and our business services offerings.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSee Note 9 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBusiness Services\nAdvertising\nInterest Rate Swaps\nManagement fee expense reflects compensation paid to MCC for the performance of services it provides our operating subsidiaries in accordance with management agreements between MCC and our operating subsidiaries.\n\n * Refer to Note 6 and Note 11 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our long-term debt and of our operating leases and other commitments and contingencies, respectively. \n\nManagement Fee Expense\nNet Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities\nVideo revenues declined 1.6%, mainly due to a lower average residential video customer base than the prior year, largely offset by rate adjustments and, to a lesser extent, greater installation fee revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we lost 28,000 video customers, compared to a loss of 30,000 video customers in the prior year. As of December 31, 2014, we served 500,000 video customers, or 33.4% of our estimated homes passed.\nHSD\nWe have entered into several interest rate exchange agreements (which we refer to as interest rate swaps\u201d) with various banks to fix the variable rate of borrowings to reduce the potential volatility in our interest expense that may result from changes in market interest rates. As December 31, 2015, we had interest rate swaps that fix the variable portion of $600 million of borrowings at a rate of 1.5%, all of which are scheduled to expire during the year ending December 31, 2018.\nThere can be no assurance that Moody's or S&P will maintain their ratings on MCC and us. A negative change to these credit ratings could result in higher interest rates on future debt issuance than we currently experience, or adversely impact our ability to raise additional funds. There are no covenants, events of default, borrowing conditions or other terms in the credit agreement or indentures that are based on changes in our credit rating assigned by any rating agency.\n\nWe are a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mediacom Communications Corporation ( MCC\u201d), the nation's eighth largest cable company based on the number of customers who purchase one or more video services, also known as video customers. As of December 31, 2015, we served approximately 480,000 video customers, 605,000 high-speed data ( HSD\u201d) customers and 239,000 phone customers, aggregating 1.32 million primary service units ( PSUs\u201d). As of the same date, we served 732,000 residential and business customer relationships.\nAdvertising revenues primarily represent revenues received from selling advertising time we receive under programming license agreements to local, regional and national advertisers for the placement of commercials on channels offered on our video services.\n\nOn August 12, 2015 and November 23, 2015, we entered into incremental facility agreements which provided for $25.0 million and $87.5 million of additional revolving credit commitments, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had $368.5 million of revolving credit commitments under our bank credit facility (the credit facility\u201d).\nIn April 2015 (as amended in August 2015), the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03 (and ASU 2015-15) - Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-03\u201d). The purpose of this guidance is to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs and requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. For public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. An entity should apply the new guidance on a retrospective basis, wherein the balance sheet of each individual period presented should be adjusted to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new guidance. We expect to reclassify approximately $22.6 million from other assets, net to long-term debt as a result of this new guidance (based upon amounts as of December 31, 2015).\nNet Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities\n (2) We have contracts with programmers who provide video programming services to our customers. Our contracts typically provide that we have an obligation to purchase video programming for our customers as long as we deliver cable services to such customers. We have no obligation to purchase these services if we are not providing cable services, except when we do not have the right to cancel the underlying contract or for contracts with a guaranteed minimum commitment. There are no programming service amounts included in our purchase obligations. \nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td>\nRevenues\nBusiness services revenues rose 11.6%, mainly as a result of a higher average SMB customer base than the prior year.\nVideo revenues increased 0.5%, mainly due to rate adjustments associated with the pass-through of higher programming costs for retransmission consent fees and, to a lesser extent, for regional sports networks, mostly offset by a lower average residential video customer base than the prior year. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we lost 20,000 video customers, compared to a loss of 28,000 video customers in the prior year. As of December 31, 2015, we served 480,000 video customers, or 32.1% of our estimated homes passed.\nBusiness services revenues grew 14.1%, mainly as a result of a higher average SMB customer base than the prior year and, to a much lesser extent, greater cell tower backhaul revenues.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nWe offer video, HSD and phone services to residential and small- to medium-sized business ( SMB\u201d) customers over our hybrid fiber and coaxial cable network. We believe our customers prefer the cost savings of the bundled services we offer, as well as the convenience of having a single provider contact for ordering, provisioning, billing and customer care. We also provide network and transport services to medium- and large sized businesses, governments, and educational institutions in our service areas, including cell tower backhaul for wireless telephone providers, and sell advertising time to local, regional and national advertisers.\nAs a result of the factors described above, we recognized net income of $137.4 million and $118.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nDebt Ratings\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe table below sets forth our consolidated statements of operations and OIBDA for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands and percentage changes that are not meaningful are marked NM):\nInterest Expense, Net\nAs of December 31, 2015, our total indebtedness was $1.830 billion, of which approximately 60% was at fixed interest rates or had interest rate exchange agreements that fixed the variable portion of debt. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we paid cash interest of $82.8 million, net of capitalized interest.\n\nAs a result of the factors described above, we recognized net income of $144.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $137.4 million in the prior year.\nOperating Income\nOur senior notes are unsecured obligations, and the indentures governing our senior notes (the indentures\u201d) limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness based upon a maximum debt to operating cash flow ratio (as defined in the indentures) of 8.5 to 1.0. For all periods through December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with covenants under the indentures including, as of the same date, a debt to operating cash flow ratio of 4.5 to 1.0. We do not believe that we will have any difficulty complying with any of the covenants under the indentures in the near future.\nThe tables below set forth revenue and selected customer and average monthly revenue statistics as of, and for the years ended, December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands, except per unit data):\nWe could record impairments in the future if there are changes in the long-term fundamentals of our business, in general market conditions or in the regulatory landscape that could prevent us from recovering the carrying value of our long-lived intangible assets. The economic conditions affecting the U.S. economy, and how that may impact the fundamentals of our business, may have a negative impact on the fair values of the assets in our reporting unit.\nOperating income rose 10.9%, predominantly due to the growth in OIBDA and, to a much lesser extent, lower depreciation and amortization.\n</td> </tr>\nInterest expense, net, increased 4.4%, principally due to a higher average cost of debt, offset in part by lower average outstanding indebtedness.\nAdvertising revenues fell 14.8%, substantially due to lower levels of political advertising compared to the prior year that had strong levels of political advertising associated with national elections.\nAdvertising\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities were $280.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to OIBDA of $369.7 million and the $6.2 million net change in our operating assets and liabilities, offset in part by interest expense of $100.4 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a decline in accounts receivable from affiliates of $4.4 million and increases in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $1.6 million and in accounts payable to affiliates of $1.5 million, offset in part by increases in accounts receivable, net, of $2.8 million.\nOur residential HSD service competes primarily with digital subscriber line ( DSL\u201d) services offered by local telephone companies. Based upon the speeds we offer, we believe our HSD service is generally superior to DSL offerings in our service areas. As consumers' bandwidth requirements have dramatically increased in the past few years, a trend many industry experts expect to continue, we believe our ability to offer a HSD service today with downstream speeds of up to 150Mbps gives us a competitive advantage compared to the DSL service offered by the local telephone companies. We expect to continue to grow HSD revenues through residential customer growth and more customers taking higher HSD speed tiers.\nHSD revenues grew 7.4%, predominantly due to a higher average residential HSD customer base than the prior year and more customers taking faster speed tiers. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we gained 30,000 HSD customers, compared to an increase of 29,000 HSD customers in the prior year. As of December 31, 2014, we served 564,000 HSD customers, or 37.6% of our estimated homes passed.\nOperating income rose 8.8%, as a result of lower depreciation and amortization and the growth in OIBDA.\nVideo\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nAs a result of changes to the mark-to-market valuation of our interest rate swaps, based on information provided by our counterparties, we recorded net gains on derivatives of $9.2 million and $23.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n2015 Financing Activity\nPhone\nService Costs\nService costs increased 5.4%, predominantly due to greater video programming expenses. Programming expenses grew 7.8%, primarily due to higher fees associated with the renewal of programming contracts for certain sports and other popular cable networks and for local broadcast stations, and contractual increases under existing carriage agreements, offset in part by a lower average video customer base since the prior year. Service costs as a percentage of revenues were 40.9% and 40.2% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCapital Structure\nITEM 7.\nBased on the guidance outlined in ASC 350, we have determined that the unit of accounting, or reporting unit, for testing goodwill and franchise rights is Mediacom Broadband. Comprising cable system clusters across several states, Mediacom Broadband is at the financial reporting level that is managed and reviewed by the corporate office (i.e., chief operating decision maker) including our determination as to how we allocate capital resources and utilize the assets. The reporting unit level also reflects the level at which the purchase method of accounting for our acquisitions was originally recorded.\nRevenues\nReference is made to the Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations and any of our forward-looking statements contained herein. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements as of, and for the years ended, December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nThe increase in capital expenditures largely reflected greater investments associated with the deployment of our advanced customer premise equipment, including our next-generation set-top and, to a lesser extent, the expansion of our fiber network, offset by lower spending on local HSD bandwidth management and, to a lesser extent, reduced outlays for fiber connectivity to cell towers for wireless carriers.\nCosts and Expenses\nPhone revenues primarily represent monthly subscription fees and equipment charged to residential customers for our phone service.\nOn December 17, 2015, we completed a new term loan ( Term Loan A\u201d) in the aggregate principal amount of $151.5 million. After giving effect to $1.7 million of financing costs, net proceeds from Term Loan A, together with borrowings under our revolving credit commitments, were used to repay the entire $194.0 million balance of the previously existing Term Loan G under the credit facility.\nBusiness Services\n (1) Represents average total monthly revenues for the year divided by average customer relationships for the year. \nThe preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Periodically, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to doubtful accounts, long-lived assets, capitalized costs and accruals. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. For a summary of our accounting policies, see Note 2 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nService Costs\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt totaled $0.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which represented the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs as a result of the repayment of certain term loans under our bank credit facility.\nGain on Derivatives, Net\nOIBDA\nThe tables below set forth revenue and selected customer and average monthly revenue statistics as of, and for the years ended, December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands, except per unit data):\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt totaled $4.4 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which represented the write-off of unamortized financing costs as a result of the repayment of certain previously existing term loans under our bank credit facility.\nOperating Income\nPhone\nAs a result of changes to the mark-to-market valuation of these interest rate swaps, based on information provided by our counterparties, we recorded net gains on derivatives of $23.2 million and $22.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nService Costs\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-28 - When to Perform Step 2 of the Goodwill Impairment Test for Reporting Units with Zero or Negative Carrying Amounts (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force), as of October 1, 2015 and 2014, we have evaluated whether there are any adverse qualitative factors surrounding our Mediacom Broadband reporting unit indicating that a goodwill impairment may exist. We do not believe that it is more likely than not\u201d that a goodwill impairment exists. As such, we have not performed Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. As of December 31, 2015, the Mediacom Broadband reporting unit had a positive carrying amount. As of December 31, 2014, the Mediacom Broadband reporting unit had a negative carrying amount.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09\u201d). The guidance states that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. An entity should also disclose sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. This guidance supersedes most industry-specific guidance, including Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 51 - Financial Reporting by Cable Television Companies. In August 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which deferred by one year the effective date of ASU 2014-09 until reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 including interim periods within the reporting period. The FASB is permitting early adoption of the updated accounting guidance, but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the methods of adoption allowed by the new standard and the effect the standard is expected to have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures\nValuation and Impairment Testing of Indefinite-lived Intangibles\nDepreciation and amortization was 6.0% lower, mainly due to older network assets becoming fully depreciated, offset in part by greater depreciation of customer premise equipment and investments in HSD bandwidth expansion and business support.\n2015 Financing Activity\nHSD revenues grew 11.1%, predominantly due to a higher average residential HSD customer base than the prior year and greater rates per residential HSD customer, largely a result of more customers taking faster speed tiers. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we gained 41,000 HSD customers, compared to a gain of 30,000 HSD customers in the prior year. As of December 31, 2015, we served 605,000 HSD customers, or 40.4% of our estimated homes passed.\nAdvertising revenues rose 14.8%, primarily due to greater levels of political advertising compared to the prior year.\nFor illustrative purposes, if there were a hypothetical decline of 15% in the fair values determined for cable franchise rights at our reporting unit, an impairment loss of $17.5 million would result as of our impairment testing date of October 1, 2015. In addition, a hypothetical decline of up to 15% in the fair values determined for goodwill and other finite-lived intangible assets at our reporting unit would not result in any impairment loss as of October 1, 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $1.4 billion of unamortized intangible assets, including franchise rights of $1.2 billion and goodwill of $0.2 billion on our consolidated balance sheets. These intangible assets represented approximately 60% of our total assets.\n (1) Interest payments on floating rate debt and interest rate swaps are estimated using amounts outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and the average interest rates applicable under such debt obligations. Interest expense amounts are net of amounts capitalized. \nDepreciation and Amortization\nOIBDA\nHSD revenues primarily represent monthly subscription fees charged to residential customers, which vary according to the level of service and equipment taken.\nNet Income\nNet cash flows used in financing activities were $148.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, comprising $127.3 million of net repayments under the credit facility, $18.0 million of dividend payments on preferred members' interest, $2.3 million of financing costs and $0.4 million of other financing activities.\nThe table below represents a reconciliation of OIBDA to operating income, which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP measure (dollars in thousands):\nOn December 17, 2015, we completed a new term loan ( Term Loan A\u201d) in the aggregate principal amount of $151.5 million, and used the net proceeds from Term Loan A, together with borrowings under our revolving credit commitments, to repay the entire $194.0 million balance of Term Loan G.\nSee Notes 4 and 6 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSignificant selling, general and administrative expenses comprise: call center, customer service, marketing, business services, support and administrative personnel; franchise fees and other taxes; bad debt; billing; marketing; advertising; and general office administration. These expenses generally rise due to customer growth and inflationary cost increases for personnel, outside vendors and other expenses. We anticipate that selling, general and administrative expenses will remain fairly consistent as a percentage of our revenues.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 - Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02\u201d). The objective of ASU 2016-02 is to address the concerns to increase the transparency around lease obligations. To address these concerns, previously unrecorded off-balance sheet obligations will now be brought more prominently to light by presenting lease liabilities on the face of the balance sheet. Accompanied by enhanced qualitative and quantitative disclosures in the notes to the financial statements, financial statement users will be able to more accurately compare information from one company to another. This guidance is effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018. We have not completed our evaluation of this new guidance.\nBank Credit Facility\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased 2.8%, largely as a result of lower employee costs, taxes and fees, and office expenses. Employee expenses were 6.7% lower, mainly as a result of the re-designation of certain business services employees previously included in selling, general, and administrative costs. Taxes and fees declined 9.0%, chiefly due to lower franchise fees and, to a lesser extent, property taxes. Office expenses fell 13.8% primarily due to lower rent and telecommunications costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 19.0% and 20.2% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nThe table below sets forth our capital expenditures (dollars in thousands):\nOther Expense, Net\nHSD\nIn accordance with ASC 350, we are required to determine goodwill impairment using a two-step process. The first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with our carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds our carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds our fair value, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill, calculated using the residual method, with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, the excess is recognized as an impairment loss.\nInflation and Changing Prices\nSee Liquidity and Capital Resources - Capital Structure - 2015 Financing Activity\u201d and Note 6 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05 - Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40) ( ASU 2015-05\u201d). The objective of ASU 2015-05 is to address the concerns of stakeholders that the lack of guidance about a customer's accounting for fees in a cloud computing arrangement leads to unnecessary cost and complexity when evaluating the accounting for those fees, as well as some diversity in practice. The amendments in ASU 2015-05 will help entities evaluate the accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement by providing guidance as to whether an arrangement includes the sale or license of software. Examples of cloud computing arrangements include software as a service, platform as a service, infrastructure as a service, and other similar hosting arrangements. This guidance is effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOIBDA grew 2.6%, primarily due to the increase in revenues, offset in part by higher programming costs.\nMCC's corporate credit ratings are Ba3 by Moody's, and BB by Standard and Poor's ( S&P\u201d), both with stable outlooks.

pricing, despite gaining 21,000 phone customers. \n\n- Video revenues decreased 1.6% due to a lower average residential video customer base, largely offset by rate adjustments. Video lost 28,000 customers.\n\n- HSD revenues grew 7.4% due to higher average residential HSD customers and more customers taking faster speed tiers. HSD gained 30,000 customers.\n\n- Business services revenues rose 11.6% due to higher SMB customer base and cell tower backhaul revenues. \n\n- Advertising revenues fell 14.8% due to lower political advertising compared to the prior election year.\n\n- OIBDA grew 5.2% due to revenue growth and lower SG&A expenses, partially offset by greater service costs.\n\n- Net income increased 15.6% to $137.4 million.\n\n- Capital expenditures were $137.3 million, largely for customer premise equipment deployment, HSD bandwidth expansion, and cell tower fiber connectivity.\n\n- The company had strong liquidity of $306.6 million available under its revolving credit facility.\n\nIn summary, the company saw growth in HSD and business services revenues but declines in video, phone, and advertising. OIBDA and net income increased versus the prior year period. The company invested heavily in its network and products. Liquidity remained strong."}
