Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. To the extent this discussion and analysis contains forward- looking statements, these statements involve risks and uncertainties. While management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made, there can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that are anticipated. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" and \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements\".\nOverview\nThe Company is the result of the Business Combination between WLRH and Holdings that closed on June 9, 2016. The \"Successor\" financial information reflects the combined operations of WLRH for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 and the operations of Holdings after the Closing Date, after purchase price allocations. The \"Predecessor\" financial information reflects the operations of Holdings prior to the Closing Date of the Business Combination.\nWe are a global distributor of chemicals products in North America and Asia, and plastics products in North America, EMEA and Asia. In connection with the distribution of chemicals products, we provide value-added services such as custom blending, packaging and re-packaging, private-label manufacturing and product testing in the form of chemical analysis, product performance analysis and product development. We also provide on-site and off-site environmental services, including waste collection, recovery, arrangement for disposal services and recycling in North America, primarily the U.S., through our Environmental Services line of business. The Predecessor was a distributor of composites products in North America until July 1, 2014, when these operations were sold and as a result, activity associated with these operations is reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. We are organized into three lines of business (or operating segments): Chemicals, Plastics and Environmental Services. During fiscal year 2016, we distributed approximately 22,000 products into over 80 countries for approximately 1,300 suppliers to over 26,700 customers. Based on revenues for calendar year 2015, the Predecessor was ranked third in North America and fifth globally among the top 100 chemicals distributors, as reported by the Independent Chemical Information Service (or ICIS), one of the largest petrochemical market information providers.\nWe have long-standing relationships with major chemicals and plastics producers and suppliers, a strong geographic presence and supply chain network and a relatively stable customer base that benefits from the service and distribution value we provide. The products we distribute are used in a broad cross section of manufacturing industries, in various end markets and customer segments within those industries, including the household, industrial and institutional, lubricants, performance coatings (including architectural coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers), automotive, healthcare, personal care, oil and gas and construction end markets.\nOur diverse array of product offerings allows us to provide many of our customers with a one-stop-shop resource for their chemicals and plastics needs. For customers with multiple locations, our centralized business model helps ensure consistency of product offerings and a single point of contact. Our services and full product offering allow for product customization, cost savings to customers on transaction and transportation costs and reliance on a single supplier to source all of a customer's diverse product requirements.\nWe believe we provide a compelling value proposition to suppliers as a single bulk buyer of their products and by acting as an extension of their sales force by representing their brands and providing technical support to customers. We also believe we provide value to suppliers by distributing to larger customers through dedicated strategic accounts sales and marketing programs designed to solidify key relationships through enhanced customer service, efficient delivery and specialized value-added solutions. In addition to the value-added services mentioned above, we provide other services including dedicated stocking programs, vendor-managed inventory, quarterly customer demand forecasting, technical support and supply chain services. In addition, our understanding of key end markets presents additional opportunities with suppliers whose products are in substantial demand by customers situated in these end markets.\nWe have an experienced management team with deep knowledge of the industry. We continue to implement strategies and invest significantly to build upon our strengths by creating industry-leading marketing capabilities, including our focus on specific end markets, sales force effectiveness tools, market-based pricing and geographic expansion.\nWe distribute our broad product portfolio through a supply chain consisting of approximately 170 owned, leased or third party warehouses, rail terminals and tank terminals globally with a private fleet of approximately 1,000 units, primarily in North America. We currently employ approximately 2,520 employees globally. At September 30, 2016, we had approximately 500 sales professionals situated in North America, EMEA and Asia, including technical support, field managers and strategic account managers to assist our customers in the selection and application of commodity and specialty products for their end products and processes.\nSegment Overview\nWe are organized into three lines of business, or operating segments: Chemicals, Plastics and Environmental Services. Our lines of business market to different sets of customers operating in an array of industries, with various end markets and customer segments within those industries. For segment presentation and disclosure purposes, our Chemicals and Plastics lines of business constitute separate reportable segments while the Environmental Services line of business, which does not meet the materiality threshold for separate disclosure is included in the \"Other\" segment.\nEach line of business represents unique products and suppliers, and each line of business focuses on specific end markets within its industry based on a variety of factors including supplier or customer opportunities, expected growth and prevailing economic conditions. Across our Chemicals and Plastics lines of business there are numerous industry segments, end markets and sub markets that we may choose to focus on. These end markets may change from year to year depending on the underlying market economics, supplier focus, expected profitability and its strategic agenda.\nOur Chemicals, Plastics and Environmental Services lines of business compete with national, regional and local companies throughout North America. Our Chemicals and Plastics lines of business compete with other distribution companies in Asia, and the Plastics line of business also competes with other distribution companies in EMEA. In addition, in some of the markets in which we operate, large chemical producers may elect to distribute their products directly to end-user customers. Competition is based primarily on the diversity and quality of the product portfolio, service offerings, reliability of supply, technical support, price and delivery capabilities. The accounting policies used to account for transactions in each of the lines of business are the same as those used to account for transactions at the corporate level.\nA brief description of each of our lines of business follows:\nChemicals. The Chemicals line of business distributes specialty and industrial chemicals, additives and solvents to industrial users via railcars, barges, bulk tanker trucks, and as packaged goods in trucks. While our chemicals products are distributed in more than 50 countries worldwide, we primarily distribute our chemicals products in North America and Asia. In connection with the distribution of chemicals products, we provide value-added services such as custom blending, packaging and re-packaging, private-label manufacturing and product testing in the form of chemical analysis, product performance analysis and product development. While our Chemicals line of business serves multiple end markets, key end markets within the industrial space are household, industrial and institutional, performance coatings (including architectural coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers), lubricants, oil and gas and personal care.\nPlastics. The Plastics line of business distributes a broad product line consisting of commodity polymer products and prime engineering resins to plastics processors engaged in blow molding, extrusion, injection molding and rotation molding via railcars, bulk trucks, truckload boxes and less-than-truckload quantities. While our plastics products are distributed in more than 50 countries worldwide, we primarily distribute our plastics products in North America, EMEA and Asia. The Plastics line of business serves a broad cross section of industrial segments with a current focus on the healthcare and automotive end markets.\nEnvironmental Services. The Environmental Services line of business, in connection with certain waste disposal service companies, provides customers with comprehensive on-site and off-site hazardous and non-hazardous waste collection, recovery and arrangement for disposal services or recycling in North America, primarily in the U.S. These environmental services are offered through our network of distribution facilities which are used as transfer facilities or through a staff of dedicated on-site waste professionals.\nKey Factors Affecting our Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nGeneral and regional economic conditions. The consumption of chemicals and plastics in the broad industry segments and end markets that we serve generally corresponds to the level of production of goods and services in the global economy, amplified by the regional economies where we have commercial operations. As a result, when general economic conditions improve or deteriorate, our volumes tend to fluctuate accordingly. We manage our cost structure in line with general economic conditions, but our volumes and profitability are ultimately correlated with the underlying demand for the end-products of the industries we serve.\nPrice fluctuations. The prices at which we resell the products we distribute in our Chemicals and Plastics lines of business generally fluctuate in accordance with the prices that we pay for these products. Product prices we pay are largely driven by the underlying global and regional economic conditions that drive the prices of two primary raw materials of production: crude oil (primarily naphtha) and natural gas (primarily ethane). These two raw material sources are used in the production of propylene and ethylene which are key feedstocks used in over 90% of organic-based commodity and specialty chemicals, as well as in the subsequent production of the intermediate plastics products we distribute. The prices of these feedstocks are also affected by other factors including choices made by feedstock producers for uses of these feedstocks (e.g., as an ingredient in gasoline versus a feedstock to the chemical industry), the capacity devoted to production of these feedstocks and other macroeconomic factors that impact the producers. As a distributor, the prices of these feedstocks are not in our control. However, we are generally able to pass on finished good price increases and decreases to our customers in accordance with the fluctuations in our product costs and transportation-related costs (e.g., fuel costs). As a result, movements in our sales revenue and cost of sales tend to correspond with changes in our product prices. Additionally, as capacity or demand patterns change, we typically experience a corresponding change in the average selling prices of the products we distribute. Our gross profit margins generally decrease in deflationary price environments because we are selling inventory that was previously purchased at higher prices. Alternatively, our gross profit margins generally increase during inflationary pricing environments because we are able to sell inventory that was previously purchased at lower prices. The extent to which profitability increases or decreases, however, also depends on the relative speed at which selling prices adjust in relation to inventory costs. As a logistics provider, oil price movements also typically impact our transportation and delivery costs.\nVolume-based pricing. We generally procure chemicals and plastics raw materials through purchase orders rather than under long-term contracts with firm commitments. Our arrangements with key producers and suppliers are typically embodied in agreements that we refer to as framework supply agreements. We work to develop strong relationships with a select group of producers and suppliers that complement our strategy based on a number of factors, including price, breadth of product offering, quality, market recognition, delivery terms and schedules, continuity of supply and each producer's strategic positioning. Our framework supply agreements with producers and suppliers typically renew annually and, while they generally do not provide for specific product pricing, some, primarily those related to our Chemicals line of business, include volume-based financial incentives through supplier rebates, which we earn by meeting or exceeding target purchase volumes.\nInflation. Our average selling prices rise in inflationary environments as producers and suppliers raise the market prices of the products that we distribute. During inflationary periods our customers maximize the amount of inventory they carry in anticipation of even higher prices and consequently, this environment of excess demand favorably impacts our volumes sold, revenues and gross profit due to the lag between rising prices and our cost of goods sold. The reverse is true in deflationary price environments. Deflationary forces create an environment of overcapacity, driving market prices of products downward, and we must quickly adjust inventories and buying patterns to respond to price declines. Our primary objective is to replace inventories at lower costs while maintaining or enhancing unit profitability.\nSome of our assets and liabilities, primarily cash, receivables, inventories and accounts payable, are impacted by inflation because they are indirectly affected by market prices of raw materials for our products. To the extent that we are able to manage our working capital in periods of changing prices, the overall impact of inflation on our net working capital is generally not significant.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations. We conduct our business on an international basis in multiple currencies. A portion of our sales and costs of sales are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. Strengthening of our subsidiaries' functional currency relative to the other currencies in which some transactions are denominated creates a negative impact on sales, but a positive impact on costs. Additionally, because we report our consolidated results in U.S. dollars, the results of operations and the financial position of our local international operations, which are generally reported in the relevant local currencies, are translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to our subsidiaries' functional currencies causes a negative impact on sales but a positive impact on costs.\nOutlook\nGeneral. We have operations in North America, EMEA and Asia. As a result, our business is subject to broad, global and regional macroeconomic factors. These factors include:\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the general state of the economy, specifically inflationary or deflationary trends, GDP growth rates and commodities/feedstocks price movements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>unemployment levels;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>government regulation and changes in governments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>fiscal and monetary policies of governments, including import and export tariffs, duties and other taxes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>general income growth and the consumption rates of products; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>rates of technological change in the industries we serve.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe monitor these factors routinely for both strategic and operational impacts.\nOur operations are most impacted by regional market price fluctuations of the primary feedstock materials, including crude oil and natural gas, and the downstream derivatives of these primary raw materials. Market price fluctuations of these primary raw materials directly impact the decisions of our product suppliers, specifically the manufacturing capacity made available for production of the products we distribute. As capacity or demand patterns change, we may experience a corresponding change in the average selling prices of the products we distribute.\nDuring fiscal year 2016, global markets have generally been sluggish and recovery has been slow as the citizens of the U.K. approved the exit of the U.K. from the European Union, while the Asia-Pacific economy projected for a decline. The U.S. economy has stabilized, however, industry demand has decreased in this region as well. Although the overall global market has been bearish, through the use of our pricing tools and discipline, we have been able to offset some of the effects of the recent global deflationary environment.\nThe following is a summary of GDP and oil price fluctuations in our various regions of operations by fiscal quarter.\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year over Year Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Q4 16 v Q4 15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Q3 16 v Q3 15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Q2 16 v Q2 15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Q1 16 v Q1 15\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. GDP Growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Industrial Production Index\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil Average Price Decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(42.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EMEA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Euro Area GDP Growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brent Crude Oil Average Price Decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(37.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(43.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>China GDP Growth (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) As reported by the Chinese government.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverall GDP growth remains below 2.0% for many of the countries in which we operate. This slow recovery, together with lower average oil prices, has resulted in lower demand, and by extension, lower sales volumes and average selling prices when compared to the prior fiscal year. In terms of currency, the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen over the prior fiscal year against most other currencies in which we transact. As a result of these factors, reported dollar revenues and gross profit have been negatively impacted in many of our regions' operations.\nNorth America\nThe North American economic environment has been relatively stable during fiscal year 2016. Although U.S. GDP has increased in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015, and the inflation rate has averaged 1% for the majority of fiscal year 2016, consumer spending, still-sluggish business investment and a slow housing sector have negatively impacted GDP. The U.S. Industrial Production Index, which more closely correlates to the chemical and plastics distribution industry, for fiscal year 2016 indicates a negative economic industry-related environment as compared to fiscal year 2015.\nIn terms of currency, the CAD declined against the U.S. dollar while comparing fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2015, which affected, among other items, the reported dollar revenues and gross profit from our Canadian operations.\nWhen compared to fiscal year 2015, we continue to see declining selling prices for the products we distributed during fiscal year 2016. Market forces and the intensity of competition have continued to apply pricing pressure.\nEMEA\nIn Europe, we conduct business primarily in the Western European countries. While the outlook for economic growth in Europe improved beginning late in fiscal year 2015, the region did experience a slight downturn late in fiscal year 2016, mainly as a result of U.K.'s decision to exit the European Union. Overall GDP growth has remained slow with many Western European nations experiencing growth below 3.0% and current developments adding uncertainty to Europe's economic prospects.\nIn terms of currency, the euro and the other European currencies weakened versus the U.S. dollar when comparing fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2015, which affected, among other items, the reported dollar revenues and gross profit from our European operations.\nThe market prices for the products we sell in Europe are closely correlated to the cost of Brent Crude Oil as these operations are primarily based on the distribution of commodity plastics products and most products are sourced in Europe. Consistent with the continuous decline in average oil prices during fiscal year 2015 and into fiscal year 2016, our operations in Europe experienced a decline in average selling prices.\nAsia\nOur operations in Asia are concentrated mainly in China. Recent GDP growth in China, as reported by the Chinese government, has been slower than their reported GDP growth over the past five years, primarily due to a weaker property sector, lower credit growth and weakened industrial production.\nIn terms of currency, the RMB declined against the U.S. dollar when comparing fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2015, which affected, among other items, the reported dollar revenues and gross profit from our China operations. However, we experienced an increase in sales revenue in China for fiscal year 2016 due to an increase in volume sales related to increased sales to historical customers and additional sales to new customers.\nStrategic Initiatives. We are focused on initiatives to enhance growth and profitability, including:\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>growing organically by increasing the breadth and depth of our specialty capabilities, expanding our suite of value-added services and driving scale enhancements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>complementing organic growth by pursuing attractive merger and acquisition opportunities and delivering value creation by leveraging our centralized platform while achieving increased geographic reach and providing enhanced product/service offerings;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>expanding margins through mix enhancement, disciplined pricing execution, platform scalability and end market diversification;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>maintaining our efforts on cost improvement through execution of our transportation strategy, warehouse productivity gains, corporate selling, general and administrative operational efficiencies and optimization of our customer coverage model;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>achieving our operational return goals by maximizing cash conversion, optimizing our working capital requirements and maintaining an asset-lite model; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>attracting and retaining the talent we need to maintain the capabilities that define a market leader.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCertain Factors Affecting Comparability to Prior Period Financial Results\nPrior to the Business Combination, WLRH operated as a special purpose acquisition company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or assets. As a result, operations were minimal before the Business Combination and are not presented in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014. After the Business Combination our results of operations are not directly comparable to historical results of the operations for the periods presented, primarily because:\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our fiscal year end was changed from December 31st to September 30th.

revenues\nSales and operating revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 decreased $2,883.4 million or 73.0%. The decrease was primarily attributable to comparing periods that include the acquired business' operating results for a 114 day period as compared to operating results of 365 days. Additionally, declines in revenue were driven by lower sales per shipping day and lower average selling prices in both our Chemicals and Plastics businesses as a result of the decline in oil and other commodity prices during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, as well as, weaker industrial demand.\nChemicals\nSales and operating revenues for the Chemicals line of business for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 decreased $1,478.0 million or 75.6%. The decrease was primarily attributable to comparing periods that include the acquired business' operating results for a 114 day period as compared to operating results of 365 days. Sales per shipping day declined 22.2% as average selling prices declined as a result of lower oil and commodity prices. Additionally, certain suppliers have elected to supply customers directly.\nPlastics\nSales and operating revenues for the Plastics line of business for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 decreased $1,329.4 million or 70.9%. The decrease was primarily attributable to comparing periods that include the acquired business' operating results for a 114 day period as compared to operating results of 365 days. Sales per shipping day decreased 7.2% as average selling prices declined due to lower oil and other commodity prices, as well as, weaker industrial demand.\nOther\nSales and operating revenues for the Other line of business for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 decreased $76.0 million or 65.0%. The decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to comparing periods that include the acquired business' operating results for a 114 day period as compared to operating results of 365 days. Revenues per working day increased 11.4% due to a favorable shift in product mix.\nGross profit\nGross profit declined $299.6 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to comparing periods that include the acquired business' operating results for a 114 day period to operating results of 365 days. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 was 10.2% as compared to 10.3% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily attributable to the recognition of $13.8 million associated with the inventory step up recorded due to the Business Combination, and additional depreciation expense of approximately $2.1 million resulting from the step up in fair value of property, plant and equipment as a result of the Business Combination.\nChemicals\nGross profit declined $168.7 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to comparing periods that include the acquired business' operating results for a 114 day period to operating results of 365 days. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the Chemicals line of business for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 was 11.7% as compared to 11.5% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase was attributable to a better pricing discipline and improved delivery costs to service our customers, offset by the recognition of $6.0 million of inventory step up recorded due to the Business Combination, and additional depreciation expense of approximately $1.6 million resulting from the step up in fair value of property, plant and equipment as a result of the Business Combination.\nPlastics\nGross profit declined $111.5 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to comparing periods that include the acquired business' operating results for a 114 day period to operating results of 365 days. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the Plastics line of business for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 was 8.0% as compared to 8.3% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to the recognition of $7.8 million related to the inventory step up recorded due to the Business Combination and additional depreciation expense of approximately $0.5 million resulting from the step up in fair value of property, plant and equipment as a result of the Business Combination.\nOther\nGross profit declined $19.4 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to comparing periods that include the acquired business' operating results for a 114 day period to operating results of 365 days. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the Other line of business for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 was 22.2% as compared to 24.4% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to price compression associated with a competitive market.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 decreased $237.8 million or 72.2% compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to comparing periods that include the acquired business' operating results for a 114 day period as compared to operating results of 365 days. Selling, general and administrative expenses per day for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 decreased approximately 10.9% compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was driven primarily by lower employee and consulting costs as a result of execution on key productivity, certain cost management initiatives, and lower employee variable compensation costs. This decrease was partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense as a result of the fair value step up in assets associated with the Business Combination and increased audit fees as a result of the Business Combination's additional reporting requirements.\nTransaction related costs\nWe incurred $21.3 million in transaction related costs for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. These costs were related to legal and consulting costs incurred in connection with the Business Combination.\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration obligations\nThe net gain of $11.2 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 is related to the contingent consideration associated with the Deferred Cash Consideration and the TRA. See Notes 3 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements.\nOther income\nOther income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 was $0.5 million and is primarily related to a $0.8 million reimbursement received for certain equipment as part of the eminent domain proceeding for our Franklin Park, Illinois facility offset by a $0.2 million loss related to sale of property and equipment. Other income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 was $11.4 million and was mainly due to a gain of $8.0 million recorded in connection with the release of escrow funds from a previous acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015, a gain of $1.7 million on the sale of old private fleet trucks and a gain of $0.6 million on the repurchase of the Notes.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 was $14.3 million and is primarily related to the debt acquired in connection with the Business Combination, along with the amortization of the costs associated with issuing the debt. Interest expense, net for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 was $64.7 million and is primarily related to the Predecessor debt, along with the amortization of the costs associated with issuing the debt. The decrease was primarily due to comparing periods that include operating results for a 114 day period as compared to operating results of 365 days.\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 was $1.2 million and is primarily attributable to foreign income tax expense on profitable foreign operations, primarily EMEA and Mexico. Successor and Predecessor income taxes are generally not comparable as the Predecessor was organized as a limited liability company and taxed as a partnership for U.S. income tax purposes. Predecessor income tax expense for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 was $3.9 million and primarily attributable to foreign income tax expense on profitable foreign operations, primarily

Sales per shipping day decreased 7.9% as average selling prices declined due to lower oil and other commodity prices as well as weaker industrial demand.\nOther\nSales and operating revenues for the Other line of business from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 decreased $35.4 million or 30.3%. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to comparing periods that include the Predecessor's operating results for a 252 day period as compared to operating results of 365 days. Revenues per working day increased 1.1% due to new customer acquisitions as well as expanded operations with existing customers.\nGross profit\nGross profit declined $136.1 million from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to comparing periods that include the Predecessor's operating results for a 252 day period to operating results of 365 days. Gross profit as a percentage of sales from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 was 11.6% as compared to 10.3% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to the positive impact from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 of (i) certain profitability initiatives, (ii) improved product mix and (iii) the decrease in cost of sales and operating expenses driven by the execution of cost saving efforts, including better utilization of our private fleet, better management of certain warehouse costs and other operating improvements and lower costs for certain products, particularly commodities.\nChemicals\nGross profit declined $88.2 million from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to comparing periods that include the Predecessor's operating results for a 252 day period to operating results of 365 days. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the Chemicals line of business from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 was 12.8% as compared to 11.5% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to the positive impact during the period from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 of (i) our profitability initiatives, (ii) effective management of product costs in the deflationary environment, (iii) improved product mix and, (iv) the continued execution of cost saving efforts including better utilization of our private fleet, better management of certain warehouse costs and other operating improvements.\nPlastics\nGross profit declined $37.5 million from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to comparing periods that include the Predecessor's operating results for a 252 day period to operating results of 365 days. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the Plastics line of business from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 was 9.9% as compared to 8.3% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily the result of the continued impact of certain profitability initiatives that are helping to reduce the impact of the price compression and volume declines we are experiencing, improved product mix and the decrease in operating expenses that resulted from the continued execution of cost saving efforts including better utilization of our private fleet, better management of certain warehouse costs and other operating improvements.\nOther\nGross profit declined $10.4 million from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to comparing periods that include the Predecessor's operating results for a 252 day period to operating results of 365 days. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the Other line of business from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 was 22.2% as compared to 24.4% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to higher costs related to new and expanded operations coupled with lower margins on recycled materials as the result of a decline in market value of the materials and some price compression associated with a competitive market.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 decreased $120.6 million or 36.6% compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to comparing periods that include the Predecessor's operating results for a 252 day period as compared to operating results of 365 days. Selling, general and administrative expenses per day for the period from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 decreased by approximately 8.2% compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily driven by lower employee and consulting costs as a result of execution on key productivity and cost management initiatives.\nTransaction related costs\nWe incurred $33.4 million in transaction related costs from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016. These costs were primarily related to legal and consulting costs incurred in connection with the Business Combination.\nOther income\nOther income from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 was $2.9 million and was primarily due to a gain of $2.0 million in the sale of old private fleet tractors that were replaced with tractors under the Ryder Lease and a $0.6 million gain on the repurchase of $9.5 million of our Notes. See Notes 5 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements. Other income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 was $11.4 million and was mainly due to a gain of $8.0 million recorded in connection with the release of escrow funds from a previous acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015, a gain of $1.7 million on the sale of old private fleet trucks and a gain of $0.6 million on the repurchase of the Notes.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 and for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 was $42.2 million and $64.7 million, respectively. Interest expense, net is primarily related to the Predecessor debt, along with the amortization of the costs associated with issuing the debt. The decrease was primarily due to comparing periods that include the Predecessor's operating results for a 252 day period as compared to operating results of 365 days.\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 was $4.2 million and attributable to income tax expense on profitable foreign operations, primarily Canada, EMEA, Puerto Rico and Mexico. Income tax expense for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 was $3.9 million and largely attributable to foreign income tax expense on profitable foreign operations, primarily Canada, Mexico, the U.K., and Spain.\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2015 (Predecessor) Compared with Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2014 (Predecessor)\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

decreased $565.4 million or 12.5%. The decrease in revenues was attributable to lower average selling prices and lower sales volumes in both our Chemicals and Plastics lines of business primarily as a result of the decline in oil prices during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. Additionally, revenue decreased as a result of the decision to stop certain transactions in North America and China that were not meeting our profitability thresholds or were not consistent with our long-term strategy, including a decision made late in fiscal year 2014 to stop serving certain trader business in China. Furthermore, revenue decreased by $121.4 million, or 2.7%, as a result of the weakening of the exchange rates of various currencies versus the U.S. dollar in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014. The decrease in revenue was partially offset by the impact to our Chemicals line of business of an additional six months of operations from both the Archway Acquisition and an additional two months of operations from the CSD Acquisition in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, which collectively contributed $93.9 million.\nChemicals\nSales and operating revenues for the Chemicals line of business for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 decreased $337.2 million or 14.7%. The revenue decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in sales volumes of our commodity products in our operations in North America and Asia, which resulted in part from the decision to stop certain transactions that were not meeting our profitability thresholds or were not consistent with our long-term strategy, including a decision made late in fiscal year 2014 to stop serving certain trader business in China. Additionally, across the multiple product categories sold, average selling prices declined in our Asia and North America operations, driven by the decline in oil prices during fiscal year 2015. While average selling prices declined in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 due to the deflationary environment, these price declines were partially offset in North America by the positive significant impact of certain pricing initiatives, as well as favorable changes in product mix. The decrease in revenue was also partially offset by the impact of an additional six months of operations from both the Archway Acquisition and an additional two months of operations from the CSD Acquisition in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, which collectively contributed $93.9 million.\nPlastics\nSales and operating revenues for the Plastics line of business for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 decreased $225.5 million or 10.7%. Revenue decreased $105.9 million, or approximately 5.0%, as a result of the weakening of the exchange rates of various currencies versus the U.S. dollar in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014. The revenue decrease was also attributable to volume declines in our operations in EMEA and China, which were the result of softer demand driven by lower oil prices in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014, as well as pricing pressure in our operations in North America and EMEA. Furthermore, revenue decreased as a result of the decision to stop certain transactions that were not meeting our profitability thresholds or were not consistent with our long-term strategy, including a decision made late in fiscal year 2014 to stop serving certain trader business in China. The overall revenue decrease was partially offset by the impact of certain profitability initiatives that are helping to reduce the impact of the price compression we were experiencing, as well as slight volume increases in our operations in North America in both commodity and specialty products.\nOther\nSales and operating revenues for the Other line of business for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 decreased $2.7 million or 2.3%. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to decreased sales volumes of composite products in our Asia operations in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. This decrease in revenues was partially offset by new customer acquisitions as well as expanded operations with existing customers.\nGross profit\nGross profit increased $6.3 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Overall, this increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to the impact of the Archway Acquisition and the CSD Acquisition on our Chemicals line of business, improved profitability resulting from the positive impact in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 of certain pricing initiatives and the decrease in certain operating expenses, such as, (i) lower costs for products, (ii) lower sales volumes in our Plastics and Chemicals lines of business and (iii) a decrease in certain operating expenses, driven by the execution of cost saving efforts, including better utilization of our private fleet, better management of certain warehouse costs and other operating improvements. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by a decrease of $8.4 million, or approximately 2.1%, as a result of the weakening of the exchange rates of various currencies versus the U.S. dollar in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014.\nChemicals\nGross profit increased $11.7 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to the impact of the Archway Acquisition and the CSD Acquisition, coupled with the positive impact during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 from our profitability initiatives, favorable changes in product mix and efforts to reduce operating costs, which offset the declines in volume and average selling prices described above. Additionally, gross profit during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 included $1.4 million from the favorable settlement of claims with suppliers, offset by the impact of a non-cash inventory impairment charge of $1.6 million associated with our operations in Asia, both of which occurred during the first quarter of fiscal year 2015. The inventory impairment was driven primarily by the impact of the significant decline in oil prices. Gross profit during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 included the effect of an inventory step-up charge of $1.2 million resulting from the CSD Acquisition and non-cash impairment charges of $1.4 million allocated to the Chemicals line of business associated with the closure of two facilities, offset by the favorable impact of $5.9 million of insurance proceeds received during that period in connection with the fire at our Garland facility.\nPlastics\nGross profit decreased $4.3 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Gross profit decreased $7.6 million, or 4.8%, as a result of the weakening of the exchange rates of various currencies versus the U.S. dollar in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014. Gross profit also decreased as the result of the overall deflationary price environment which caused us to sell inventory that was previously purchased at higher prices, primarily in the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2015. The decrease in gross profit was partially offset by the impact of certain profitability initiatives that were helping to reduce the impact of the price compression we were experiencing, and the decrease in operating expenses that resulted from the execution of cost saving efforts including better utilization of our private fleet, better management of certain warehouse costs and other operating improvements.\nOther\nGross profit decreased $1.1 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 primarily due to decreased sales volumes of composite products in our Asia operations compared to fiscal year 2014 partially offset by an increase driven by new customer acquisitions as well as expanded operations with existing customers.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 decreased $6.3 million or 1.9% compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses is approximately $12.7 million, including $3.3 million of depreciation and amortization expense, attributable to the estimated impact of two months of additional operations from the CSD Acquisition and six additional months of operations from the Archway Acquisition during fiscal year 2015. Beginning on July 1, 2015, we fully integrated Archway into our own operations. Excluding the impact of this $12.7 million, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $19.0 million in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to (i) a decrease of $5.6 million in consulting costs, (ii) lower travel costs of $4.1 million, (iii) lower employee costs of $3.3 million, (iv) lower bad debt expense of $2.8 million, primarily related to specific customer write-offs in fiscal year 2014, (v) other costs decrease of $2.4 million, primarily related to telecommunications expense and (vi) lower insurance costs of $1.9 million. Lower expenses were the result of our execution on key productivity and cost management initiatives. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $1.2 million associated with facility, equipment and vehicle investments made in fiscal year 2015, and an unfavorable foreign exchange variance over the prior fiscal year of $1.0 million primarily associated with fluctuations in the RMB exchange rate versus the U.S. dollar.\nTransaction related costs\nWe incurred $0.1 million in transaction related costs for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 compared to $12.6 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, a decrease of $12.5 million. Transaction related costs incurred during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 related primarily to legal and consulting costs incurred in connection with the CSD Acquisition and the Archway Acquisition, which closed on December 1, 2013 and April 1, 2014, respectively.\nOther income\nOther income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 increased $6.0 million or 111.1% compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Other income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 included (i) a gain of $8.0 million recorded in connection with the release of escrow funds from the CSD Acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015, (ii) a gain of $1.7 million on the sale of old private fleet trucks and (iii) a gain of $0.6 million on the repurchase of our Notes. Other income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 was primarily related to a gain of $4.0 million recorded in connection with insurance proceeds related to the fire at our Garland facility.\nInterest expense, net\nNet interest expense for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 increased $1.1 million or 1.7% compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Interest expense was primarily related to the Predecessor Term Loan Facility, the Notes and the Predecessor ABL Facility, along with the amortization of the costs associated with issuing the debt. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to additional borrowings under the Predecessor Term Loan Facility as a result of the amendment entered into in the second quarter of fiscal year 2014. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense related to lower short-term and Predecessor ABL Facility borrowings outstanding during fiscal year 2015.\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 decreased $3.4 million or 46.6% compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Income tax expense for these fiscal years is primarily determined by the taxable income in foreign jurisdictions and certain U.S., Federal, state and local jurisdictions. The decrease in income tax expense in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 is largely attributed to the reduced profitability of our China operations.\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 decreased $19.2 million or 104.3% compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. The loss from discontinued operations during fiscal year 2015 was the result of certain expenses incurred to terminate activity and relationships associated with these operations. Income from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 was primarily related to the gain recorded on the Composites Sale of $14.3 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations and our borrowing availability under the ABL Facility. Cash flows generated from our operations are influenced by seasonal patterns of our business and other timing circumstances that can result in increases or decreases in working capital requirements for any given period during the course of our fiscal year. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from our operating activities will continue to be primarily dependent on purchasing and distributing chemical and plastic materials. Additionally, our ability to generate cash flows in the normal course of business can be significantly influenced by changing global and regional macroeconomic conditions. Borrowing availability under the ABL Facility is subject to a borrowing base generally comprised of eligible inventory, accounts receivable and cash and cash equivalents held in certain accounts and certain of its subsidiaries. Our availability under the ABL Facility is, therefore, potentially subject to fluctuations, depending on the value of the eligible assets in the borrowing base on a given valuation date. An inability to borrow under the ABL Facility may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operating cash requirements consist principally of inventory purchases, trade credit extended to customers, labor, occupancy costs and transportation and delivery costs. Non-operating cash requirements include debt service requirements, acquisition-related costs and capital expenditures.\nCapital Expenditures\nCash capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 for the Successor and from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 for the Predecessor were $12.7 million and $14.2 million, respectively, and related primarily to facility improvements and information technology investments. We expect our aggregate capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 (excluding acquisitions and any assets acquired via capital leases) to be approximately $25.0-$30.0 million. These expenditures are expected to be primarily related to fixed asset replacements, improvements to our information technology infrastructure and additions of equipment and vehicles.\nThe Predecessor took delivery of 106 tractors under the Ryder Lease during the period from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 and made capital lease payments of $2.9 million. The Successor took delivery of the final tractor and made capital lease payments of $1.8 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. In connection with the delivery of these tractors, $13.9 million of equipment cost and corresponding capital lease obligations were reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the Predecessor. The initial total equipment cost and corresponding capital lease obligations associated with the Ryder Lease were $25.9 million. We are permitted to terminate the lease of an individual tractor on the anniversary of its delivery date, provided that certain conditions are met. In the event we terminate the lease of an individual tractor in accordance with the terms of the Ryder Lease, we may elect to purchase the individual tractor at a predetermined residual value or return the tractor to Ryder, subject to an adjustment based on the then-current market value of the individual tractor. See Notes 5 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the Predecessor entered into a lease agreement for a new facility in Montgomery, Illinois. The lease has a term of 15 years, with annual payments beginning at $1.1 million per year. This lease agreement is accounted for as a capital lease and the lease term began in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.\nIndebtedness\nOn June 9, 2016, we entered into the ABL Facility which provides for asset-based secured credit financing. We also entered into the Term Loan Facility, which allows us to draw secured term loan financing.\nCredit Facilities\nABL Facility\nOn June 9, 2016, the ABL Borrowers entered into the ABL Facility which provides for revolving credit financing including a U.S. Tranche of up to $505.0 million, a Canadian Tranche of up to the U.S. dollar equivalent of $40.0 million, and a FILO Tranche up to $30.0 million. Under the ABL Facility, up to $50.0 million in the case of the U.S. Tranche and $10.0 million in the case of the Canadian Tranche may be short-term borrowings upon same-day notice, referred to as swingline loans. The ABL Facility is unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by Holdings and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sub Holding. Additionally, Solutions, Holdings and Sub Holding are also co-borrowers under the U.S. Tranche and the FILO Tranche of the ABL Facility on a joint and several basis, and Nexeo Solutions Canada Corp. is the borrower under the Canadian Tranche. The ABL Facility matures on June 9, 2021. Provided no default or event of default then exists or would arise therefrom, the ABL Borrowers have the option, at the beginning of each quarter, to request that the ABL Facility be increased by an aggregate amount, when included with any incremental borrowings issued under the Term Loan Facility, not to exceed $175.0 million. .\nObligations under the ABL Facility are secured by a first priority lien on all ABL first lien collateral, including eligible inventory and accounts receivable of the ABL Borrowers, and a second priority lien on all Term Loan first lien collateral (other than a second priority security interest in, and mortgages on, any real property), including outstanding equity interests of the Borrower and certain of the other subsidiaries of Holdings, in each case, subject to certain limitations; provided, that no ABL Facility first lien collateral or Term Loan Facility first lien collateral owned by the Canadian Borrower secure the obligations owing under the U.S. tranche of the ABL Facility.\nThe ABL Facility includes a letter of credit sub-facility, which permits up to $200.0 million of letters of credit under the U.S. Tranche (which may be denominated in U.S. dollars, euros or other currencies approved by the administrative agent and the issuing bank) and up to the U.S. dollar equivalent of $10.0 million of letters of credit under the Canadian Tranche (which may be denominated in CAD only). The ABL Facility also contains a FILO Tranche which can be used by any non-Canadian foreign subsidiary for loans or letters of credit up to an aggregate amount not to exceed $30.0 million.\nFees paid to the lenders during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 in connection with the ABL Facility totaled $6.8 million and were recorded as debt issuance costs in Other non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheet to be amortized as interest expense over the remaining term of the ABL Facility.\nAt September 30, 2016, we had $117.7 million in borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility. Interest expense related to the ABL Facility, excluding amortization of debt issuance costs, was $1.8 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016.\nTerm Loan Facility\nOn June 9, 2016, Neon Finance Company LLC (which was subsequently merged with and into Solutions) entered into the Term Loan Facility that provides secured debt financing in an aggregate principal amount of up to $655.0 million and the right, at our option, to request additional tranches of term loans in an aggregate principal amount, when included with any incremental borrowings issued under the ABL Facility, amount up to $175.0 million, plus unlimited additional amounts such that the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding at the time of incurrence does not cause the consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio, calculated on a pro forma basis, to exceed 4.1 to 1.0. Availability of such additional tranches of term loans are subject to the absence of any default, and among other things, the receipt of commitments by existing or additional financial institutions. Proceeds of $651.7 million, net of discount of $3.3 million were received in connection with the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility matures on June 9, 2023.\nObligations under the Term Loan Facility are secured by a first priority lien on all Term Loan first lien collateral, including outstanding equity interests of the Borrower and certain of the other subsidiaries of Holdings, and a second priority lien on all ABL first lien collateral, including accounts receivable and inventory of the loan parties under the Term Loan Facility, subject to certain limitations.\nAt September 30, 2016, we had $653.4 million in borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan Facility. We are required to make early principal payments on an annual basis, commencing with the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017, if cash flows for the year, as defined in the agreement, exceed certain levels specified in the agreement. Interest expense related to the Term Loan Facility, excluding original issue discount amortization and amortization of debt issuance costs was $10.9 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016.\nFees paid to the lenders during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 in connection with the Term Loan Facility totaled $18.5 million and were recorded as a reduction of the debt balance to be amortized as interest expense over the remaining term of the Term Loan Facility.\nAt September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with the covenants of the Credit Facilities.\nPredecessor Credit Facilities\nIn addition to cash flows generated from its operations, the Predecessor's sources of liquidity included borrowings under the Predecessor Credit Facilities. The Predecessor's ABL Facility was scheduled to mature on July 11, 2017 and the Predecessor Term Loan Facility was scheduled to mature on September 9, 2017. As of the Closing Date, the Predecessor was in compliance with the covenants of the Predecessor Credit Facilities. In connection with the completion of the Business Combination, a principal payment of $617.5 million was made and all of the Predecessor's outstanding indebtedness and other obligations under the Predecessor Credit Facilities were fully discharged.\nPredecessor Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018\nThe Notes were scheduled to mature on March 1, 2018. Effective as of the Closing Date, the Issuers redeemed all of the approximately $149.7 million principal amount of the Notes outstanding at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount (plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including the Closing Date). The Issuers had previously notified the holders of the Notes that they had elected to redeem the Notes on the Closing Date. The Issuers and the guarantors under the Notes have been released from their respective obligations under the Notes and the Indenture governing the Notes, effective as of the Closing Date.\nAs of the Closing Date, the Predecessor was in compliance with the covenants of the indenture governing the Notes.\nLiquidity\nThe following table summarizes our liquidity position as of September 30, 2016 for the Successor and September 30, 2015 for the Predecessor:\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Successor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Predecessor\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>September 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Predecessor ABL Facility availability\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>321.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ABL Facility availability\n</td> <td>273.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liquidity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>321.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>449.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAt September 30, 2016, we had $47.5 million in cash and cash equivalents of which $41.9 million was held by foreign subsidiaries, $36.9 million of which was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily in euros and RMB. At September 30, 2016, we had $6.5 million in China denominated in RMB. While the RMB is convertible into U.S. dollars, foreign exchange transactions are subject to approvals from the SAFE. We do not anticipate any significant adverse impact to overall liquidity from restrictions on cash and cash equivalents.\nABL Facility\nUnder the ABL Facility, if as of any date of determination when Trigger Event Excess Availability (as defined in the ABL Facility) is below certain thresholds or upon certain defaults, the ABL Borrowers will be required to deposit cash on a daily basis from certain depository accounts in a collection account maintained with the administrative agent, which will be used to repay outstanding loans and cash collateralized letters of credit. At September 30, 2016, Trigger Event Excess Availability under the ABL Facility was $273.8 million, which was $230.3 million in excess of the $43.5 million threshold that would trigger the foregoing requirements.\nBased on current and anticipated levels of operations, capital spending projections and conditions in our markets, we believe that cash on hand, together with cash flows from operations and borrowings available under the ABL Facility, are adequate to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs as well as any debt service and other cash requirements for at least twelve months.\nIn addition to operating and non-operating cash requirements previously described, our longer-term liquidity needs are primarily related to our final maturity debt payments due in 2021 and 2023. Depending on market conditions and other factors, we may also consider alternative financing options, including, but not limited to, issuance of equity, issuance of new debt or refinancing of our existing debt obligations.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth the major categories of our cash flows for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 for the Successor, and from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 and fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 for the Predecessor.\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Successor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Predecessor\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>154.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities from continuing operations\n</td> <td>133.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(270.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>133.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(209.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>(88.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(121.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(81.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>166.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>47.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(63.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>127.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2016 (Successor) Compared with Period October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016, Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 (Predecessor)\nCash flows from operating activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 was $3.2 million, based on a 114 day operating period. Net loss from continuing operations of $8.4 million, adjusted for loss on sale of property and equipment and significant non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization expenses, debt issuance costs amortization, transaction costs paid in stock, equity based compensation, and changes relating to contingent consideration liabilities, deferred income taxes, provision for bad debt and reimbursement for certain capital expenditures incurred in connection with eminent domain proceeding, collectively totaling $23.0 million, provided $14.6 million of cash inflow from continuing operations during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. Additionally, cash flows from continuing operations were impacted by an increase in accounts and notes receivable of $5.0 million, primarily driven by the timing of collections on accounts receivable during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. There have been no significant changes in billing terms or collection processes during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. Additionally, cash flows from operations were impacted by a net decrease of $19.4 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses, driven primarily by payment of approximately $29.4 million of transaction costs accrued by the Predecessor at the time of the closing of the Business Combination, partially offset by the timing of payments and a decrease in inventories of $12.5 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The decrease in inventories includes the decrease of $13.8 million related to the fair value adjustment to inventory as of the Closing Date, partially offset by a shift in inventory mix towards higher value plastics products.\nNet cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the period from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 for the Predecessor was $69.5 million, based on a 252 day operating period. Net loss from continuing operations of $13.9 million, adjusted for gain on sale of property and equipment and significant non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization expenses, debt issuance costs, bad debt, equity based compensation, deferred income taxes and gain on debt extinguishment, collectively totaling $46.2 million, resulted in $32.3 million of cash inflow from continuing operations for the period from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016. Additionally, cash flows from continuing operations were positively impacted by a decrease in accounts and notes receivable of $34.4 million, increase in accounts payable of $13.4 million and a decrease in inventory of $8.4 million. These amounts were offset by a decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $9.7 million and a change in other current assets and other operating assets and liabilities of $9.0 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 for the Predecessor, was $154.7 million. Net income from continuing operations of $21.2 million, adjusted for gains on sale of assets, gain from debt extinguishment and significant non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization expenses, debt issuance costs amortization, provision for bad debt, inventory impairment, deferred income taxes and equity-based compensation charges, collectively totaling $64.4 million, provided $85.6 million of cash inflow from continuing operations during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. Additionally, cash flows from continuing operations were impacted by a decrease in accounts and notes receivable of $109.7 million, driven by lower sales volumes experienced during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, falling average selling prices and timing of collections at year end. There were no significant changes in billing terms or collection processes during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. Additionally, cash flows from operations were impacted by a net decrease of $98.9 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses, primarily driven by lower inventory purchases due to lower volumes. The decrease in inventory of $50.5 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 reflects the impact of lower prices for inventory purchases as well as improved inventory management. Additionally, there was a decrease in other current assets of $8.2 million partially due to a reduction in inventory prepayments.\nNet cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 for the Predecessor, was $50.8 million. The net loss from continuing operations of $12.2 million, adjusted for gains on sale of assets, gain from proceeds of insurance claims, foreign currency gain and significant non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization expenses, debt issuance costs amortization, provision for bad debt, deferred income taxes, equity-based compensation charges and the foreign currency gain on purchase of additional equity interest in Nexeo Plaschem, collectively totaling $60.2 million, provided $48.0 million of cash inflow from continuing operations during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Additionally, cash flows from continuing operations were positively impacted by an increase in accounts payable and other accrued expenses of $44.7 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. However, the Predecessor experienced a negative impact on cash flows from continuing operations during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 resulting from a net increase in accounts and notes receivable of $31.2 million and a net increase in inventories of $9.9 million. The increase in accounts and notes receivable was driven primarily by timing of collections at period end. Additionally, the increase in accounts and notes receivable reflects the impact of activity related to CSD's and Archway's operations. There were no significant changes in billing terms or collection processes during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. The increase in inventories during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 reflected the impact of inventory purchases related to CSD's and Archway's operations.\nCash flows from investing activities\nInvesting activities provided $133.0 million of cash during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to withdrawing $501.1 million from the trust account offset by the cash paid to effect the Business Combination of $360.6 million, net of cash acquired, and the addition of property and equipment of $12.7 million, primarily related to facility improvements and information technology investments. These expenditures were partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of assets of $4.7 million and the reimbursement of $0.5 million received for certain equipment under an eminent domain proceeding related to one of our facilities.\nInvesting activities used $11.8 million of cash for the period from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 for the Predecessor, primarily due to capital expenditures of $14.2 million throughout the period, related primarily to facility improvements, additional information technology investments and vehicle additions. These expenditures were partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of assets of $2.4 million.\nInvesting activities used $31.5 million of cash during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 for the Predecessor, primarily due to capital expenditures of $35.6 million throughout the fiscal year, primarily related to facility improvements, information technology investments and vehicle additions and replacements. These expenditures were partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of assets of $4.1 million.\nInvesting activities used $270.0 million of cash during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 for the Predecessor, primarily due to the closing of the Archway Acquisition for $128.7 million in April 2014, the closing of the CSD Acquisition for $96.4 million in December 2013 and capital expenditures of $49.9 million throughout the fiscal year, primarily related to additions to the Predecessor's private delivery fleet, facility improvements, and information technology investments.\nCash flows from financing activities\nFinancing activities used $88.9 million of cash during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, primarily as a result of repaying Predecessor long-term debt of $767.3 million, repayment of long-term debt of $205.4 million and the payment of debt issuance costs of $25.3 million. These were offset by the issuance of long-term debt of $972.5 million and proceeds of short-term debt of $13.3 million. The Company also issued common stock as consideration for the Business Combination of $234.9 million and redeemed stock of $298.5 million.\nFinancing activities used $121.5 million of cash for the period from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 for the Predecessor, primarily as a result of repaying long-term debt and capital leases of $417.3 million and the repayment of short-term debt of $17.1 million. These were offset by the issuance of long-term debt of $292.1 million and proceeds of short-term debt of $20.9 million.\nFinancing activities used $81.8 million of cash for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 for the Predecessor, primarily as a result of net payments on the Predecessor ABL Facility and the Notes of $13.8 million and $14.8 million, respectively, net payments of $12.1 million on short-term lines of credit available to Nexeo Plaschem and payments under the Predecessor Term Loan Facility of $6.7 million. In addition, financing activities included the purchase of the remaining equity interest in Nexeo Plaschem for $34.3 million.\nFinancing activities provided $166.5 million of cash for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 for the Predecessor, primarily as a result of the Predecessor Term Loan proceeds of $169.2 million and net borrowings under the Predecessor ABL Facility of $102.1 million. Proceeds from borrowings were partially offset by the purchases of additional equity interests in Nexeo Plaschem for $92.2 million, quarterly installments on the Predecessor Term Loan Facility of $6.3 million and net payments of $4.0 million on short-term lines of credit available to Nexeo Plaschem.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nAt September 30, 2016, amounts due under our contractual commitments were as follows:\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period (in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More\nthan 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term and long-term debt obligations (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>620.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>809.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated interest payments on long-term debt obligations (2)\n</td> <td>38.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>247.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations (3)\n</td> <td>8.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (4)\n</td> <td>15.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (5)\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee benefit obligations\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contingent consideration (6)\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>241.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>167.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>298.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>842.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,426.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Short-term obligations primarily include the payment of $38.4 million outstanding under credit facilities available to Nexeo Plaschem and $6.6 million in principal installment payments under the Term Loan Facility and Long-term debt obligations include the payment of $117.7 million in outstanding principal (at September 30, 2016) under the ABL Facility and the payment of $646.8 million in remaining outstanding principal under the Term Loan Facility.

We make these estimates based on historical experience and on other judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates, judgments and assumptions form the basis for our determinations as to the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe consider an accounting policy to be critical when it requires the most difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are highly uncertain. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect our most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, products are shipped and title is transferred or services are provided to customers, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue for product sales is recognized at the time title and risk of loss transfer to the customer, based on the terms of the sale. For products delivered under our standard shipping terms, title and risk of loss transfer when the product is delivered to the customer's delivery site. For sales transactions designated Freight on Board shipping point, the customer assumes risk of loss and title transfers at the time of shipment. Deferred revenues may result from (i) delivery delays for products delivered under our standard shipping terms or (ii) from bill and hold or other arrangements with our customers. Sales are reported net of tax assessed by qualifying governmental authorities.\nWe are generally the primary obligor in sales transactions with our customers, retain inventory risk during transit and assume credit risk for amounts billed to our customers. Accordingly, we recognize revenue primarily based on the gross amount billed to our customers. In sales transactions where we are not the primary obligor and do not retain inventory risk, we recognize revenue on a net basis by recognizing only the commission we retain from such sales and including that commission in sales and operating revenues in our consolidated statements of operations.\nConsistent with industry standards, we may offer volume-based rebates to large customers if the customer purchases a specified volume with us over a specified time period. The determination of these rebates at an interim date involves management judgment. As a result, our revenues may be affected if a customer earns a rebate toward the end of a year that we had not expected or if its estimate of customer purchases are less than expected. We have the experience and access to relevant information that we believe is necessary to reasonably estimate the amounts of such deductions from gross revenues. We regularly review the information related to these estimates and adjusts our reserves accordingly if and when actual experience differs from previous estimates. We recognize the rebate obligation as a reduction of revenue based on the estimate of the total volume of purchases from a given customer over the specified period of time.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nGoodwill. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of March 31st and whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as operating segments or groupings of businesses one level below the operating segment level. Our operating segments are the same as the reporting units used in our goodwill impairment test. Relevant accounting guidance allows the consideration of qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment of goodwill has occurred. In the absence of sufficient qualitative factors, goodwill impairment is determined utilizing a two-step process. Under step one, if the fair value of a reporting unit (determined using a market approach if market prices are available, or alternatively, a discounted cash flow model) exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. The determination of the fair value of a reporting unit requires the use of key estimates about its future operating results, valuation multiples, discount rates and terminal growth rates. These key assumptions can change due to many factors and these changes can materially affect the fair value estimate and cause us to re-evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill. Once an impairment of goodwill has been recorded, it cannot be reversed.\nOther Long-Lived Assets. Property, plant and equipment and other intangibles with definite lives are tested for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. When an impairment test is performed and the undiscounted expected future cash flow is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. The factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating results, trends and prospects, as well as the effect of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors.\nContingencies and Environmental Costs\nLiabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. Gain contingencies are not recorded until management determines it is certain that the future event will become or does become a reality.\nLiabilities for environmental remediation costs are recognized when environmental assessments or remediation are probable and the associated costs can be reasonably estimated. Generally, the timing of these provisions coincides with the commitment to a formal plan of action or, if earlier, the divestment or closure of the relevant site. Environmental reserves are subject to numerous uncertainties that affect our ability to accurately estimate costs, or our share of costs if multiple parties are responsible. These uncertainties involve the legal, regulatory and enforcement parameters governing environmental assessment and remediation, the nature and extent of contamination at the site, the extent of required remediation efforts, the choice of remediation methodology, availability of insurance coverage and, in the case of a site with multiple responsible parties, the number and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties.\nUnder the ADA Purchase Agreement, Ashland agreed to retain the Retained Specified Remediation Liabilities. Ashland's obligation for these liabilities is not subject to any claim thresholds or deductibles other than expenses the Predecessor incurs arising out of the Other Retained Remediation Liabilities; if the Predecessor incurs expenses arising out of the Other Retained Remediation Liabilities, Ashland's indemnification obligation is subject to an individual claim threshold of $0.2 million and an aggregate claim deductible of $5.0 million. Ashland's indemnification obligation for the Retained Remediation Liabilities is subject to an aggregate ceiling of $75.0 million. Ashland's indemnification obligations resulting from its breach of any representation, warranty or covenant related to environmental matters (other than for liabilities relating to taxes or the breach of any fundamental representation or warranty) are generally limited by an individual claim threshold of $0.2 million, an aggregate claim deductible of $18.6 million and a ceiling of $93.0 million. Collectively, Ashland's indemnification obligations resulting from or relating to the Retained Remediation Liabilities, retained litigation liabilities, and the breach of Ashland's representations, warranties and covenants contained in the ADA Purchase Agreement (other than for liabilities relating to taxes or the breach of any fundamental representation or warranty) are subject to an aggregate ceiling of $139.5 million, and Ashland's total indemnification obligation under the ADA Purchase Agreement (other than for liabilities relating to taxes or any retained indebtedness) is subject to an aggregate ceiling in the amount of the purchase price for the Distribution Business net assets. Ashland's indemnification obligations under the ADA Purchase Agreement as described above terminated as of March 31, 2016, other than for the Retained Specified Remediation Liabilities and for the Other Retained Remediation liabilities reported to Ashland prior to March 31, 2016. As a result, any environmental remediation liabilities reported to Ashland after March 31, 2016 and not arising out of a Retained Remediation Liability will be liabilities of the Company.\nBased on the indemnification discussed above, we do not currently have any environmental or remediation reserves for matters that were covered by the ADA Purchase Agreement. However, if we were to incur expenses related to the Other Retained Remediation Liabilities, we would be responsible for the first $5.0 million in aggregate expenses relating thereto prior to the receipt of any indemnification from Ashland. In addition, if any Retained Specified Remediation Liability ultimately exceeds the liability ceilings described above, we would be responsible for such excess amounts. In either of these scenarios, and for liabilities associated with our operation of the business, we would be required to take appropriate environmental or remediation reserves.\nSee Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.\nBusiness Combinations\nIn accounting for business combinations, the purchase price paid to acquire a business is allocated to its assets and liabilities based on the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. These fair values are often estimated through the application of the income approach which requires us to estimate future cash inflows and outflows and apply an appropriate discount rate. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. A significant amount of judgment is involved in estimating the individual fair values of property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. The estimated fair values assigned to the net assets acquired could have a significant effect on our results of operations in the future. The estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, while we use all available information to make these fair value determinations and generally engage third party consultants for assistance, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value. During fiscal year 2016, we completed the Business Combination. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.\nSupplier Rebates\nCertain of our vendor arrangements provide for purchase incentives based on us achieving a specified volume of purchases. We record the volume-based purchase incentives as a reduction of inventory costs (and related cost of sales) based on our purchases to date and our estimates of purchases for the remainder of the calendar year. We receive these incentives in the form of rebates that are payable only when our purchases equal or exceed the relevant calendar year target. The determination of these rebates at an interim date involves management judgment. As a result, our cost of sales may be affected if we earn an incentive toward the end of a year that we had not expected to earn in earlier periods or if we fail to earn an incentive that we had expected to earn and had recorded the incentive based on our prior estimates.\nDeferred Taxes\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year differences are expected to reverse.\nThe recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions are subject to various assumptions and judgment by us. If actual results differ from the estimates made by us in establishing or maintaining valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, the resulting change in the valuation allowance would generally impact earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the respective deferred tax asset. Additionally, the positions taken with regard to tax contingencies may be subject to audit and review by tax authorities, which may result in future taxes, interest and penalties.\nIn determining the recoverability of deferred tax assets, we give consideration to all available evidence on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis, and then increase or decrease our valuation allowance as appropriate.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.", "item_7_truncated": "Financing activities used $81.8 million of cash for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 for the Predecessor, primarily as a result of net payments on the Predecessor ABL Facility and the Notes of $13.8 million and $14.8 million, respectively, net payments of $12.1 million on short-term lines of credit available to Nexeo Plaschem and payments under the Predecessor Term Loan Facility of $6.7 million.

Gross profit decreased $7.6 million, or 4.8%, as a result of the weakening of the exchange rates of various currencies versus the U.S. dollar in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014. Gross profit also decreased as the result of the overall deflationary price environment which caused us to sell inventory that was previously purchased at higher prices, primarily in the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2015. The decrease in gross profit was partially offset by the impact of certain profitability initiatives that were helping to reduce the impact of the price compression we were experiencing, and the decrease in operating expenses that resulted from the execution of cost saving efforts including better utilization of our private fleet, better management of certain warehouse costs and other operating improvements.\nWe consider an accounting policy to be critical when it requires the most difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are highly uncertain.

The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to comparing periods that include the acquired business' operating results for a 114 day period to operating results of 365 days. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 was 10.2% as compared to 10.3% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily attributable to the recognition of $13.8 million associated with the inventory step up recorded due to the Business Combination, and additional depreciation expense of approximately $2.1 million resulting from the step up in fair value of property, plant and equipment as a result of the Business Combination.\nPlastics\nRevenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, products are shipped and title is transferred or services are provided to customers, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue for product sales is recognized at the time title and risk of loss transfer to the customer, based on the terms of the sale. For products delivered under our standard shipping terms, title and risk of loss transfer when the product is delivered to the customer's delivery site. For sales transactions designated Freight on Board shipping point, the customer assumes risk of loss and title transfers at the time of shipment. Deferred revenues may result from (i) delivery delays for products delivered under our standard shipping terms or (ii) from bill and hold or other arrangements with our customers.

The decrease was primarily attributable to comparing periods that include the acquired business' operating results for a 114 day period as compared to operating results of 365 days. Selling, general and administrative expenses per day for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 decreased approximately 10.9% compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was driven primarily by lower employee and consulting costs as a result of execution on key productivity, certain cost management initiatives, and lower employee variable compensation costs. This decrease was partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense as a result of the fair value step up in assets associated with the Business Combination and increased audit fees as a result of the Business Combination's additional reporting requirements.\nGross profit declined $136.1 million from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to comparing periods that include the Predecessor's operating results for a 252 day period to operating results of 365 days. Gross profit as a percentage of sales from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 was 11.6% as compared to 10.3% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to the positive impact from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 of (i) certain profitability initiatives, (ii) improved product mix and (iii) the decrease in cost of sales and operating expenses driven by the execution of cost saving efforts, including better utilization of our private fleet, better management of certain warehouse costs and other operating improvements and lower costs for certain products, particularly commodities.\nWe are a global distributor of chemicals products in North America and Asia, and plastics products in North America, EMEA and Asia. In connection with the distribution of chemicals products, we provide value-added services such as custom blending, packaging and re-packaging, private-label manufacturing and product testing in the form of chemical analysis, product performance analysis and product development. We also provide on-site and off-site environmental services, including waste collection, recovery, arrangement for disposal services and recycling in North America, primarily the U.S., through our Environmental Services line of business. The Predecessor was a distributor of composites products in North America until July 1, 2014, when these operations were sold and as a result, activity associated with these operations is reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. We are organized into three lines of business (or operating segments): Chemicals, Plastics and Environmental Services. During fiscal year 2016, we distributed approximately 22,000 products into over 80 countries for approximately 1,300 suppliers to over 26,700 customers. Based on revenues for calendar year 2015, the Predecessor was ranked third in North America and fifth globally among the top 100 chemicals distributors, as reported by the Independent Chemical Information Service (or ICIS), one of the largest petrochemical market information providers.\nBased on current and anticipated levels of operations, capital spending projections and conditions in our markets, we believe that cash on hand, together with cash flows from operations and borrowings available under the ABL Facility, are adequate to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs as well as any debt service and other cash requirements for at least twelve months.\nOverview\nIndebtedness\nDeferred Taxes\nVolume-based pricing. We generally procure chemicals and plastics raw materials through purchase orders rather than under long-term contracts with firm commitments. Our arrangements with key producers and suppliers are typically embodied in agreements that we refer to as framework supply agreements. We work to develop strong relationships with a select group of producers and suppliers that complement our strategy based on a number of factors, including price, breadth of product offering, quality, market recognition, delivery terms and schedules, continuity of supply and each producer's strategic positioning. Our framework supply agreements with producers and suppliers typically renew annually and, while they generally do not provide for specific product pricing, some, primarily those related to our Chemicals line of business, include volume-based financial incentives through supplier rebates, which we earn by meeting or exceeding target purchase volumes.\nThe recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions are subject to various assumptions and judgment by us. If actual results differ from the estimates made by us in establishing or maintaining valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, the resulting change in the valuation allowance would generally impact earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the respective deferred tax asset. Additionally, the positions taken with regard to tax contingencies may be subject to audit and review by tax authorities, which may result in future taxes, interest and penalties.\nPredecessor Credit Facilities\nInvesting activities used $11.8 million of cash for the period from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 for the Predecessor, primarily due to capital expenditures of $14.2 million throughout the period, related primarily to facility improvements, additional information technology investments and vehicle additions. These expenditures were partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of assets of $2.4 million.\n (1) Short-term obligations primarily include the payment of $38.4 million outstanding under credit facilities available to Nexeo Plaschem and $6.6 million in principal installment payments under the Term Loan Facility and Long-term debt obligations include the payment of $117.7 million in outstanding principal (at September 30, 2016) under the ABL Facility and the payment of $646.8 million in remaining outstanding principal under the Term Loan Facility. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. \nLiabilities for environmental remediation costs are recognized when environmental assessments or remediation are probable and the associated costs can be reasonably estimated. Generally, the timing of these provisions coincides with the commitment to a formal plan of action or, if earlier, the divestment or closure of the relevant site. Environmental reserves are subject to numerous uncertainties that affect our ability to accurately estimate costs, or our share of costs if multiple parties are responsible. These uncertainties involve the legal, regulatory and enforcement parameters governing environmental assessment and remediation, the nature and extent of contamination at the site, the extent of required remediation efforts, the choice of remediation methodology, availability of insurance coverage and, in the case of a site with multiple responsible parties, the number and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties.\nFinancing activities used $121.5 million of cash for the period from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 for the Predecessor, primarily as a result of repaying long-term debt and capital leases of $417.3 million and the repayment of short-term debt of $17.1 million. These were offset by the issuance of long-term debt of $292.1 million and proceeds of short-term debt of $20.9 million.\nTransaction related costs\n (2) Estimated interest payments include cash interest payments and estimated commitment fees on long-term debt obligations. Variable rate interest payments were estimated using interest rates at September 30, 2016 held constant to maturity. \nSegment Overview\nSales and operating revenues for the Other line of business for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 decreased $2.7 million or 2.3%. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to decreased sales volumes of composite products in our Asia operations in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. This decrease in revenues was partially offset by new customer acquisitions as well as expanded operations with existing customers.\nEach line of business represents unique products and suppliers, and each line of business focuses on specific end markets within its industry based on a variety of factors including supplier or customer opportunities, expected growth and prevailing economic conditions. Across our Chemicals and Plastics lines of business there are numerous industry segments, end markets and sub markets that we may choose to focus on. These end markets may change from year to year depending on the underlying market economics, supplier focus, expected profitability and its strategic agenda.\nChemicals\nInflation. Our average selling prices rise in inflationary environments as producers and suppliers raise the market prices of the products that we distribute. During inflationary periods our customers maximize the amount of inventory they carry in anticipation of even higher prices and consequently, this environment of excess demand favorably impacts our volumes sold, revenues and gross profit due to the lag between rising prices and our cost of goods sold. The reverse is true in deflationary price environments. Deflationary forces create an environment of overcapacity, driving market prices of products downward, and we must quickly adjust inventories and buying patterns to respond to price declines. Our primary objective is to replace inventories at lower costs while maintaining or enhancing unit profitability.\nSales and operating revenues for the Other line of business for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 decreased $76.0 million or 65.0%. The decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to comparing periods that include the acquired business' operating results for a 114 day period as compared to operating results of 365 days. Revenues per working day increased 11.4% due to a favorable shift in product mix.\nOn June 9, 2016, the ABL Borrowers entered into the ABL Facility which provides for revolving credit financing including a U.S. Tranche of up to $505.0 million, a Canadian Tranche of up to the U.S. dollar equivalent of $40.0 million, and a FILO Tranche up to $30.0 million. Under the ABL Facility, up to $50.0 million in the case of the U.S. Tranche and $10.0 million in the case of the Canadian Tranche may be short-term borrowings upon same-day notice, referred to as swingline loans. The ABL Facility is unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by Holdings and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sub Holding. Additionally, Solutions, Holdings and Sub Holding are also co-borrowers under the U.S. Tranche and the FILO Tranche of the ABL Facility on a joint and several basis, and Nexeo Solutions Canada Corp. is the borrower under the Canadian Tranche. The ABL Facility matures on June 9, 2021. Provided no default or event of default then exists or would arise therefrom, the ABL Borrowers have the option, at the beginning of each quarter, to request that the ABL Facility be increased by an aggregate amount, when included with any incremental borrowings issued under the Term Loan Facility, not to exceed $175.0 million..\nCash flows from financing activities\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year differences are expected to reverse.\nIncome tax expense from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 was $4.2 million and attributable to income tax expense on profitable foreign operations, primarily Canada, EMEA, Puerto Rico and Mexico. Income tax expense for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 was $3.9 million and largely attributable to foreign income tax expense on profitable foreign operations, primarily Canada, Mexico, the U.K., and Spain.\nOther income\nInvesting activities provided $133.0 million of cash during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to withdrawing $501.1 million from the trust account offset by the cash paid to effect the Business Combination of $360.6 million, net of cash acquired, and the addition of property and equipment of $12.7 million, primarily related to facility improvements and information technology investments. These expenditures were partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of assets of $4.7 million and the reimbursement of $0.5 million received for certain equipment under an eminent domain proceeding related to one of our facilities.\nWe have an experienced management team with deep knowledge of the industry. We continue to implement strategies and invest significantly to build upon our strengths by creating industry-leading marketing capabilities, including our focus on specific end markets, sales force effectiveness tools, market-based pricing and geographic expansion.\nRevenue Recognition\nFinancing activities provided $166.5 million of cash for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 for the Predecessor, primarily as a result of the Predecessor Term Loan proceeds of $169.2 million and net borrowings under the Predecessor ABL Facility of $102.1 million. Proceeds from borrowings were partially offset by the purchases of additional equity interests in Nexeo Plaschem for $92.2 million, quarterly installments on the Predecessor Term Loan Facility of $6.3 million and net payments of $4.0 million on short-term lines of credit available to Nexeo Plaschem.\nSales and operating revenues for the Plastics line of business from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 decreased $683.9 million or 36.5%. The decrease was primarily attributable to comparing periods that include the Predecessor's operating results for a 252 day period as compared to operating results of 365 days. Sales per shipping day decreased 7.9% as average selling prices declined due to lower oil and other commodity prices as well as weaker industrial demand.\nTerm Loan Facility\nIncome tax expense for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 decreased $3.4 million or 46.6% compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Income tax expense for these fiscal years is primarily determined by the taxable income in foreign jurisdictions and certain U.S., Federal, state and local jurisdictions. The decrease in income tax expense in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 is largely attributed to the reduced profitability of our China operations.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations. We conduct our business on an international basis in multiple currencies. A portion of our sales and costs of sales are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. Strengthening of our subsidiaries' functional currency relative to the other currencies in which some transactions are denominated creates a negative impact on sales, but a positive impact on costs. Additionally, because we report our consolidated results in U.S. dollars, the results of operations and the financial position of our local international operations, which are generally reported in the relevant local currencies, are translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to our subsidiaries' functional currencies causes a negative impact on sales but a positive impact on costs.\nSome of our assets and liabilities, primarily cash, receivables, inventories and accounts payable, are impacted by inflation because they are indirectly affected by market prices of raw materials for our products. To the extent that we are able to manage our working capital in periods of changing prices, the overall impact of inflation on our net working capital is generally not significant.\nNet cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 was $3.2 million, based on a 114 day operating period. Net loss from continuing operations of $8.4 million, adjusted for loss on sale of property and equipment and significant non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization expenses, debt issuance costs amortization, transaction costs paid in stock, equity based compensation, and changes relating to contingent consideration liabilities, deferred income taxes, provision for bad debt and reimbursement for certain capital expenditures incurred in connection with eminent domain proceeding, collectively totaling $23.0 million, provided $14.6 million of cash inflow from continuing operations during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. Additionally, cash flows from continuing operations were impacted by an increase in accounts and notes receivable of $5.0 million, primarily driven by the timing of collections on accounts receivable during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. There have been no significant changes in billing terms or collection processes during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. Additionally, cash flows from operations were impacted by a net decrease of $19.4 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses, driven primarily by payment of approximately $29.4 million of transaction costs accrued by the Predecessor at the time of the closing of the Business Combination, partially offset by the timing of payments and a decrease in inventories of $12.5 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The decrease in inventories includes the decrease of $13.8 million related to the fair value adjustment to inventory as of the Closing Date, partially offset by a shift in inventory mix towards higher value plastics products.\nCash capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 for the Successor and from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 for the Predecessor were $12.7 million and $14.2 million, respectively, and related primarily to facility improvements and information technology investments. We expect our aggregate capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 (excluding acquisitions and any assets acquired via capital leases) to be approximately $25.0-$30.0 million. These expenditures are expected to be primarily related to fixed asset replacements, improvements to our information technology infrastructure and additions of equipment and vehicles.\nCash Flows\nNorth America\nThe ABL Facility includes a letter of credit sub-facility, which permits up to $200.0 million of letters of credit under the U.S. Tranche (which may be denominated in U.S. dollars, euros or other currencies approved by the administrative agent and the issuing bank) and up to the U.S. dollar equivalent of $10.0 million of letters of credit under the Canadian Tranche (which may be denominated in CAD only). The ABL Facility also contains a FILO Tranche which can be used by any non-Canadian foreign subsidiary for loans or letters of credit up to an aggregate amount not to exceed $30.0 million.\nOther\n\nGross profit declined $37.5 million from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to comparing periods that include the Predecessor's operating results for a 252 day period to operating results of 365 days. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the Plastics line of business from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 was 9.9% as compared to 8.3% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily the result of the continued impact of certain profitability initiatives that are helping to reduce the impact of the price compression and volume declines we are experiencing, improved product mix and the decrease in operating expenses that resulted from the continued execution of cost saving efforts including better utilization of our private fleet, better management of certain warehouse costs and other operating improvements.\nOur Chemicals, Plastics and Environmental Services lines of business compete with national, regional and local companies throughout North America. Our Chemicals and Plastics lines of business compete with other distribution companies in Asia, and the Plastics line of business also competes with other distribution companies in EMEA. In addition, in some of the markets in which we operate, large chemical producers may elect to distribute their products directly to end-user customers. Competition is based primarily on the diversity and quality of the product portfolio, service offerings, reliability of supply, technical support, price and delivery capabilities. The accounting policies used to account for transactions in each of the lines of business are the same as those used to account for transactions at the corporate level.\nThe following table sets forth the major categories of our cash flows for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 for the Successor, and from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 and fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 for the Predecessor.\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 decreased $19.2 million or 104.3% compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. The loss from discontinued operations during fiscal year 2015 was the result of certain expenses incurred to terminate activity and relationships associated with these operations. Income from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 was primarily related to the gain recorded on the Composites Sale of $14.3 million.\nInterest expense, net\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. To the extent this discussion and analysis contains forward- looking statements, these statements involve risks and uncertainties. While management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made, there can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that are anticipated. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" and \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements\".\nA brief description of each of our lines of business follows:\n \u25e6 Plant, property and equipment, \n \u2022 In connection with the Business Combination, certain assets and liabilities had fair value adjustments applied to the Predecessor's consolidated financial statements on the Closing Date, most notably: \nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe incurred $0.1 million in transaction related costs for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 compared to $12.6 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, a decrease of $12.5 million. Transaction related costs incurred during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 related primarily to legal and consulting costs incurred in connection with the CSD Acquisition and the Archway Acquisition, which closed on December 1, 2013 and April 1, 2014, respectively.\nSales and operating revenues\nSee Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.\nOur operating cash requirements consist principally of inventory purchases, trade credit extended to customers, labor, occupancy costs and transportation and delivery costs. Non-operating cash requirements include debt service requirements, acquisition-related costs and capital expenditures.\n (6) Liabilities for contingent consideration are related (i) to the TRA that we entered into with the Selling Equityholders and (ii) the Deferred Cash Consideration that will be paid to Selling Equityholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement. The amount included in the table above for the Deferred Cash Consideration is based on the undiscounted expected value of the payment and is currently included in the 4-5 Years column based on the final payment date of June 9, 2021 as defined in the Merger Agreement. However, as further defined in the Merger Agreement, payments could be required to be made by the Company prior to June 9, 2021. The timing of payments associated with the liability for the contingent consideration related to the TRA is based on expected undiscounted cash flows in future periods, and may change based on actual results. See Notes 3 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements. \nTransaction related costs\nSales and operating revenues\nNet cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the period from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 for the Predecessor was $69.5 million, based on a 252 day operating period. Net loss from continuing operations of $13.9 million, adjusted for gain on sale of property and equipment and significant non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization expenses, debt issuance costs, bad debt, equity based compensation, deferred income taxes and gain on debt extinguishment, collectively totaling $46.2 million, resulted in $32.3 million of cash inflow from continuing operations for the period from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016. Additionally, cash flows from continuing operations were positively impacted by a decrease in accounts and notes receivable of $34.4 million, increase in accounts payable of $13.4 million and a decrease in inventory of $8.4 million. These amounts were offset by a decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $9.7 million and a change in other current assets and other operating assets and liabilities of $9.0 million.\nThe North American economic environment has been relatively stable during fiscal year 2016. Although U.S. GDP has increased in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015, and the inflation rate has averaged 1% for the majority of fiscal year 2016, consumer spending, still-sluggish business investment and a slow housing sector have negatively impacted GDP. The U.S. Industrial Production Index, which more closely correlates to the chemical and plastics distribution industry, for fiscal year 2016 indicates a negative economic industry-related environment as compared to fiscal year 2015.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nABL Facility\nNet interest expense for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 increased $1.1 million or 1.7% compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Interest expense was primarily related to the Predecessor Term Loan Facility, the Notes and the Predecessor ABL Facility, along with the amortization of the costs associated with issuing the debt. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to additional borrowings under the Predecessor Term Loan Facility as a result of the amendment entered into in the second quarter of fiscal year 2014. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense related to lower short-term and Predecessor ABL Facility borrowings outstanding during fiscal year 2015.\nChemicals\nPrice fluctuations. The prices at which we resell the products we distribute in our Chemicals and Plastics lines of business generally fluctuate in accordance with the prices that we pay for these products. Product prices we pay are largely driven by the underlying global and regional economic conditions that drive the prices of two primary raw materials of production: crude oil (primarily naphtha) and natural gas (primarily ethane). These two raw material sources are used in the production of propylene and ethylene which are key feedstocks used in over 90% of organic-based commodity and specialty chemicals, as well as in the subsequent production of the intermediate plastics products we distribute. The prices of these feedstocks are also affected by other factors including choices made by feedstock producers for uses of these feedstocks (e.g., as an ingredient in gasoline versus a feedstock to the chemical industry), the capacity devoted to production of these feedstocks and other macroeconomic factors that impact the producers. As a distributor, the prices of these feedstocks are not in our control. However, we are generally able to pass on finished good price increases and decreases to our customers in accordance with the fluctuations in our product costs and transportation-related costs (e.g., fuel costs). As a result, movements in our sales revenue and cost of sales tend to correspond with changes in our product prices. Additionally, as capacity or demand patterns change, we typically experience a corresponding change in the average selling prices of the products we distribute. Our gross profit margins generally decrease in deflationary price environments because we are selling inventory that was previously purchased at higher prices. Alternatively, our gross profit margins generally increase during inflationary pricing environments because we are able to sell inventory that was previously purchased at lower prices. The extent to which profitability increases or decreases, however, also depends on the relative speed at which selling prices adjust in relation to inventory costs. As a logistics provider, oil price movements also typically impact our transportation and delivery costs.\nPlastics\nOther income from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 was $2.9 million and was primarily due to a gain of $2.0 million in the sale of old private fleet tractors that were replaced with tractors under the Ryder Lease and a $0.6 million gain on the repurchase of $9.5 million of our Notes. See Notes 5 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements. Other income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 was $11.4 million and was mainly due to a gain of $8.0 million recorded in connection with the release of escrow funds from a previous acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015, a gain of $1.7 million on the sale of old private fleet trucks and a gain of $0.6 million on the repurchase of the Notes.\nSales and operating revenues for the Plastics line of business for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 decreased $225.5 million or 10.7%. Revenue decreased $105.9 million, or approximately 5.0%, as a result of the weakening of the exchange rates of various currencies versus the U.S. dollar in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014. The revenue decrease was also attributable to volume declines in our operations in EMEA and China, which were the result of softer demand driven by lower oil prices in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014, as well as pricing pressure in our operations in North America and EMEA. Furthermore, revenue decreased as a result of the decision to stop certain transactions that were not meeting our profitability thresholds or were not consistent with our long-term strategy, including a decision made late in fiscal year 2014 to stop serving certain trader business in China. The overall revenue decrease was partially offset by the impact of certain profitability initiatives that are helping to reduce the impact of the price compression we were experiencing, as well as slight volume increases in our operations in North America in both commodity and specialty products.\n (4) Operating lease obligations represent payments for a variety of facilities and equipment under non-cancellable operating lease agreements, including office buildings, transportation equipment, warehouses and storage facilities and other equipment. \nOther\nOn July 1, 2014, the Predecessor sold its North American composites operations. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, these operations are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented and are excluded from the segment analysis tables and discussions below.\n (5) Purchase obligations are related to (i) certain IT-related contracts, (ii) non-cancellable equipment orders and (iii) estimated obligation costs to relocate employees or new hires in various U.S. locations, primarily in The Woodlands, Texas. The relocations are assumed to be completed within one year, although it is not practicable to establish definite completion dates for each employee's relocation. \nOther\nSales and operating revenues\nChemicals\nSales and operating revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 decreased $565.4 million or 12.5%. The decrease in revenues was attributable to lower average selling prices and lower sales volumes in both our Chemicals and Plastics lines of business primarily as a result of the decline in oil prices during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. Additionally, revenue decreased as a result of the decision to stop certain transactions in North America and China that were not meeting our profitability thresholds or were not consistent with our long-term strategy, including a decision made late in fiscal year 2014 to stop serving certain trader business in China. Furthermore, revenue decreased by $121.4 million, or 2.7%, as a result of the weakening of the exchange rates of various currencies versus the U.S. dollar in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014. The decrease in revenue was partially offset by the impact to our Chemicals line of business of an additional six months of operations from both the Archway Acquisition and an additional two months of operations from the CSD Acquisition in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, which collectively contributed $93.9 million.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2015 (Predecessor) Compared with Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2014 (Predecessor)\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nNet cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 for the Predecessor, was $154.7 million. Net income from continuing operations of $21.2 million, adjusted for gains on sale of assets, gain from debt extinguishment and significant non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization expenses, debt issuance costs amortization, provision for bad debt, inventory impairment, deferred income taxes and equity-based compensation charges, collectively totaling $64.4 million, provided $85.6 million of cash inflow from continuing operations during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. Additionally, cash flows from continuing operations were impacted by a decrease in accounts and notes receivable of $109.7 million, driven by lower sales volumes experienced during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, falling average selling prices and timing of collections at year end. There were no significant changes in billing terms or collection processes during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. Additionally, cash flows from operations were impacted by a net decrease of $98.9 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses, primarily driven by lower inventory purchases due to lower volumes. The decrease in inventory of $50.5 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 reflects the impact of lower prices for inventory purchases as well as improved inventory management. Additionally, there was a decrease in other current assets of $8.2 million partially due to a reduction in inventory prepayments.\nWe have long-standing relationships with major chemicals and plastics producers and suppliers, a strong geographic presence and supply chain network and a relatively stable customer base that benefits from the service and distribution value we provide. The products we distribute are used in a broad cross section of manufacturing industries, in various end markets and customer segments within those industries, including the household, industrial and institutional, lubricants, performance coatings (including architectural coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers), automotive, healthcare, personal care, oil and gas and construction end markets.\nOur consolidated financial statements reflect a number of significant estimates that impact the carrying values of assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenue and expenses. We make these estimates based on historical experience and on other judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates, judgments and assumptions form the basis for our determinations as to the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n (3) Capital lease obligations represent future payments on capital lease agreements, including lease payments on all tractors under the Ryder Lease. The amounts above include executory costs of $2.1 million per year, for aggregate executory costs totaling $12.6 million. Additionally, the amounts include decreasing annual interest payments ranging from $1.2 million to $0.1 million, for aggregate interest payments totaling $4.9 million. We are permitted to terminate the lease of an individual tractor on the anniversary of its delivery date, provided that certain conditions are met. In the event we terminate the lease of an individual tractor in accordance with the terms of the Ryder Lease, we may elect to purchase the individual tractor at a predetermined residual value or return the tractor to Ryder, subject to an adjustment based on the then-current market value of the individual tractor. Amounts also include payments under the new facility lease in Montgomery, Illinois, which began in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. See Notes 5 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements. \n* not meaningful\nThe Predecessor took delivery of 106 tractors under the Ryder Lease during the period from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 and made capital lease payments of $2.9 million. The Successor took delivery of the final tractor and made capital lease payments of $1.8 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. In connection with the delivery of these tractors, $13.9 million of equipment cost and corresponding capital lease obligations were reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the Predecessor. The initial total equipment cost and corresponding capital lease obligations associated with the Ryder Lease were $25.9 million. We are permitted to terminate the lease of an individual tractor on the anniversary of its delivery date, provided that certain conditions are met. In the event we terminate the lease of an individual tractor in accordance with the terms of the Ryder Lease, we may elect to purchase the individual tractor at a predetermined residual value or return the tractor to Ryder, subject to an adjustment based on the then-current market value of the individual tractor. See Notes 5 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements.\nSupplier Rebates\nContingencies and Environmental Costs\nThe following is a summary of GDP and oil price fluctuations in our various regions of operations by fiscal quarter.\n\nWe are organized into three lines of business, or operating segments: Chemicals, Plastics and Environmental Services. Our lines of business market to different sets of customers operating in an array of industries, with various end markets and customer segments within those industries. For segment presentation and disclosure purposes, our Chemicals and Plastics lines of business constitute separate reportable segments while the Environmental Services line of business, which does not meet the materiality threshold for separate disclosure is included in the \"Other\" segment.\n \u2022 government regulation and changes in governments; \nInterest expense, net\nBased on the indemnification discussed above, we do not currently have any environmental or remediation reserves for matters that were covered by the ADA Purchase Agreement. However, if we were to incur expenses related to the Other Retained Remediation Liabilities, we would be responsible for the first $5.0 million in aggregate expenses relating thereto prior to the receipt of any indemnification from Ashland. In addition, if any Retained Specified Remediation Liability ultimately exceeds the liability ceilings described above, we would be responsible for such excess amounts. In either of these scenarios, and for liabilities associated with our operation of the business, we would be required to take appropriate environmental or remediation reserves.\nEMEA\n\nGross profit declined $111.5 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to comparing periods that include the acquired business' operating results for a 114 day period to operating results of 365 days. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the Plastics line of business for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 was 8.0% as compared to 8.3% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to the recognition of $7.8 million related to the inventory step up recorded due to the Business Combination and additional depreciation expense of approximately $0.5 million resulting from the step up in fair value of property, plant and equipment as a result of the Business Combination.\nGross profit increased $11.7 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to the impact of the Archway Acquisition and the CSD Acquisition, coupled with the positive impact during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 from our profitability initiatives, favorable changes in product mix and efforts to reduce operating costs, which offset the declines in volume and average selling prices described above. Additionally, gross profit during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 included $1.4 million from the favorable settlement of claims with suppliers, offset by the impact of a non-cash inventory impairment charge of $1.6 million associated with our operations in Asia, both of which occurred during the first quarter of fiscal year 2015. The inventory impairment was driven primarily by the impact of the significant decline in oil prices. Gross profit during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 included the effect of an inventory step-up charge of $1.2 million resulting from the CSD Acquisition and non-cash impairment charges of $1.4 million allocated to the Chemicals line of business associated with the closure of two facilities, offset by the favorable impact of $5.9 million of insurance proceeds received during that period in connection with the fire at our Garland facility.\nGross profit increased $6.3 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Overall, this increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to the impact of the Archway Acquisition and the CSD Acquisition on our Chemicals line of business, improved profitability resulting from the positive impact in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 of certain pricing initiatives and the decrease in certain operating expenses, such as, (i) lower costs for products, (ii) lower sales volumes in our Plastics and Chemicals lines of business and (iii) a decrease in certain operating expenses, driven by the execution of cost saving efforts, including better utilization of our private fleet, better management of certain warehouse costs and other operating improvements. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by a decrease of $8.4 million, or approximately 2.1%, as a result of the weakening of the exchange rates of various currencies versus the U.S. dollar in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014.\nPrior to the Business Combination, WLRH operated as a special purpose acquisition company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or assets. As a result, operations were minimal before the Business Combination and are not presented in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014. After the Business Combination our results of operations are not directly comparable to historical results of the operations for the periods presented, primarily because:\n* not meaningful\n\n \u2022 attracting and retaining the talent we need to maintain the capabilities that define a market leader. \nSales and operating revenues for the Chemicals line of business for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 decreased $337.2 million or 14.7%. The revenue decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in sales volumes of our commodity products in our operations in North America and Asia, which resulted in part from the decision to stop certain transactions that were not meeting our profitability thresholds or were not consistent with our long-term strategy, including a decision made late in fiscal year 2014 to stop serving certain trader business in China. Additionally, across the multiple product categories sold, average selling prices declined in our Asia and North America operations, driven by the decline in oil prices during fiscal year 2015. While average selling prices declined in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 due to the deflationary environment, these price declines were partially offset in North America by the positive significant impact of certain pricing initiatives, as well as favorable changes in product mix. The decrease in revenue was also partially offset by the impact of an additional six months of operations from both the Archway Acquisition and an additional two months of operations from the CSD Acquisition in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, which collectively contributed $93.9 million.\nOverall GDP growth remains below 2.0% for many of the countries in which we operate. This slow recovery, together with lower average oil prices, has resulted in lower demand, and by extension, lower sales volumes and average selling prices when compared to the prior fiscal year. In terms of currency, the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen over the prior fiscal year against most other currencies in which we transact. As a result of these factors, reported dollar revenues and gross profit have been negatively impacted in many of our regions' operations.\n \u25e6 Intangible assets, \nOther\nCredit Facilities\nIn Europe, we conduct business primarily in the Western European countries. While the outlook for economic growth in Europe improved beginning late in fiscal year 2015, the region did experience a slight downturn late in fiscal year 2016, mainly as a result of U.K.'s decision to exit the European Union. Overall GDP growth has remained slow with many Western European nations experiencing growth below 3.0% and current developments adding uncertainty to Europe's economic prospects.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nTransaction related costs\nOn June 9, 2016, Neon Finance Company LLC (which was subsequently merged with and into Solutions) entered into the Term Loan Facility that provides secured debt financing in an aggregate principal amount of up to $655.0 million and the right, at our option, to request additional tranches of term loans in an aggregate principal amount, when included with any incremental borrowings issued under the ABL Facility, amount up to $175.0 million, plus unlimited additional amounts such that the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding at the time of incurrence does not cause the consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio, calculated on a pro forma basis, to exceed 4.1 to 1.0. Availability of such additional tranches of term loans are subject to the absence of any default, and among other things, the receipt of commitments by existing or additional financial institutions. Proceeds of $651.7 million, net of discount of $3.3 million were received in connection with the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility matures on June 9, 2023.\n \u2022 maintaining our efforts on cost improvement through execution of our transportation strategy, warehouse productivity gains, corporate selling, general and administrative operational efficiencies and optimization of our customer coverage model; \nPlastics\nSales and operating revenues from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 decreased $1,609.0 million or 40.7%. The decrease was primarily attributable to comparing periods that include the Predecessor's operating results for a 252 day period as compared to operating results of 365 days. Additionally, declines in revenue were driven by lower sales per shipping day and lower average selling prices in both our Chemicals and Plastics businesses as a result of the decline in oil and other commodity prices from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016, as well as, weaker industrial demand.\nChemicals\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration obligations\nWe incurred $33.4 million in transaction related costs from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016. These costs were primarily related to legal and consulting costs incurred in connection with the Business Combination.\nAt September 30, 2016, amounts due under our contractual commitments were as follows:\nInvesting activities used $31.5 million of cash during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 for the Predecessor, primarily due to capital expenditures of $35.6 million throughout the fiscal year, primarily related to facility improvements, information technology investments and vehicle additions and replacements. These expenditures were partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of assets of $4.1 million.\nInterest expense, net for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 was $14.3 million and is primarily related to the debt acquired in connection with the Business Combination, along with the amortization of the costs associated with issuing the debt. Interest expense, net for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 was $64.7 million and is primarily related to the Predecessor debt, along with the amortization of the costs associated with issuing the debt. The decrease was primarily due to comparing periods that include operating results for a 114 day period as compared to operating results of 365 days.\nGeneral and regional economic conditions. The consumption of chemicals and plastics in the broad industry segments and end markets that we serve generally corresponds to the level of production of goods and services in the global economy, amplified by the regional economies where we have commercial operations. As a result, when general economic conditions improve or deteriorate, our volumes tend to fluctuate accordingly. We manage our cost structure in line with general economic conditions, but our volumes and profitability are ultimately correlated with the underlying demand for the end-products of the industries we serve.\nGross profit declined $10.4 million from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to comparing periods that include the Predecessor's operating results for a 252 day period to operating results of 365 days. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the Other line of business from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 was 22.2% as compared to 24.4% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to higher costs related to new and expanded operations coupled with lower margins on recycled materials as the result of a decline in market value of the materials and some price compression associated with a competitive market.\nInterest expense, net from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 and for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 was $42.2 million and $64.7 million, respectively. Interest expense, net is primarily related to the Predecessor debt, along with the amortization of the costs associated with issuing the debt. The decrease was primarily due to comparing periods that include the Predecessor's operating results for a 252 day period as compared to operating results of 365 days.\nOther income\nThe Successor period includes operating results of the acquired business from June 9, 2016 through September 30, 2016 and operating results of WLRH for the full fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, whereas, the Predecessor period represents the full fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 of only the Predecessor's operating results.\nThe net gain of $11.2 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 is related to the contingent consideration associated with the Deferred Cash Consideration and the TRA. See Notes 3 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements.\nPlastics\nWe incurred $21.3 million in transaction related costs for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. These costs were related to legal and consulting costs incurred in connection with the Business Combination.\nFees paid to the lenders during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 in connection with the Term Loan Facility totaled $18.5 million and were recorded as a reduction of the debt balance to be amortized as interest expense over the remaining term of the Term Loan Facility.\nGross profit\nWe are generally the primary obligor in sales transactions with our customers, retain inventory risk during transit and assume credit risk for amounts billed to our customers. Accordingly, we recognize revenue primarily based on the gross amount billed to our customers. In sales transactions where we are not the primary obligor and do not retain inventory risk, we recognize revenue on a net basis by recognizing only the commission we retain from such sales and including that commission in sales and operating revenues in our consolidated statements of operations.\nBusiness Combinations\nSales and operating revenues for the Other line of business from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 decreased $35.4 million or 30.3%. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to comparing periods that include the Predecessor's operating results for a 252 day period as compared to operating results of 365 days. Revenues per working day increased 1.1% due to new customer acquisitions as well as expanded operations with existing customers.\nDuring fiscal year 2016, global markets have generally been sluggish and recovery has been slow as the citizens of the U.K. approved the exit of the U.K. from the European Union, while the Asia-Pacific economy projected for a decline. The U.S. economy has stabilized, however, industry demand has decreased in this region as well. Although the overall global market has been bearish, through the use of our pricing tools and discipline, we have been able to offset some of the effects of the recent global deflationary environment.\n \nAt September 30, 2016, we had $653.4 million in borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan Facility. We are required to make early principal payments on an annual basis, commencing with the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017, if cash flows for the year, as defined in the agreement, exceed certain levels specified in the agreement. Interest expense related to the Term Loan Facility, excluding original issue discount amortization and amortization of debt issuance costs was $10.9 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \u2022 The fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 only includes 114 days of the acquired business' operating activities as a result of the consummation of the Business Combination on June 9, 2016. \nThe market prices for the products we sell in Europe are closely correlated to the cost of Brent Crude Oil as these operations are primarily based on the distribution of commodity plastics products and most products are sourced in Europe. Consistent with the continuous decline in average oil prices during fiscal year 2015 and into fiscal year 2016, our operations in Europe experienced a decline in average selling prices.\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.\nOther income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 increased $6.0 million or 111.1% compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Other income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 included (i) a gain of $8.0 million recorded in connection with the release of escrow funds from the CSD Acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015, (ii) a gain of $1.7 million on the sale of old private fleet trucks and (iii) a gain of $0.6 million on the repurchase of our Notes. Other income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 was primarily related to a gain of $4.0 million recorded in connection with insurance proceeds related to the fire at our Garland facility.\n \u2022 expanding margins through mix enhancement, disciplined pricing execution, platform scalability and end market diversification; \nAs a result of the factors listed above, historical results of operations and other financial data, as well as period-to-period comparisons of these results, may not be comparable or indicative of future operating results or future financial condition.\nFinancing activities used $88.9 million of cash during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, primarily as a result of repaying Predecessor long-term debt of $767.3 million, repayment of long-term debt of $205.4 million and the payment of debt issuance costs of $25.3 million. These were offset by the issuance of long-term debt of $972.5 million and proceeds of short-term debt of $13.3 million. The Company also issued common stock as consideration for the Business Combination of $234.9 million and redeemed stock of $298.5 million.\nChemicals\nLiquidity\nIn addition to cash flows generated from its operations, the Predecessor's sources of liquidity included borrowings under the Predecessor Credit Facilities. The Predecessor's ABL Facility was scheduled to mature on July 11, 2017 and the Predecessor Term Loan Facility was scheduled to mature on September 9, 2017. As of the Closing Date, the Predecessor was in compliance with the covenants of the Predecessor Credit Facilities. In connection with the completion of the Business Combination, a principal payment of $617.5 million was made and all of the Predecessor's outstanding indebtedness and other obligations under the Predecessor Credit Facilities were fully discharged.\nGross profit decreased $1.1 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 primarily due to decreased sales volumes of composite products in our Asia operations compared to fiscal year 2014 partially offset by an increase driven by new customer acquisitions as well as expanded operations with existing customers.\nAt September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with the covenants of the Credit Facilities.\nCertain Factors Affecting Comparability to Prior Period Financial Results\nIn terms of currency, the RMB declined against the U.S. dollar when comparing fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2015, which affected, among other items, the reported dollar revenues and gross profit from our China operations. However, we experienced an increase in sales revenue in China for fiscal year 2016 due to an increase in volume sales related to increased sales to historical customers and additional sales to new customers.\nThe Company is the result of the Business Combination between WLRH and Holdings that closed on June 9, 2016. The \"Successor\" financial information reflects the combined operations of WLRH for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 and the operations of Holdings after the Closing Date, after purchase price allocations. The \"Predecessor\" financial information reflects the operations of Holdings prior to the Closing Date of the Business Combination.\nSales and operating revenues for the Chemicals line of business from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 decreased $889.7 million or 45.5%. The decrease was primarily attributable to comparing periods that include the Predecessor's operating results for a 252 day period as compared to operating results of 365 days. Sales per shipping day declined 21.0% as average selling prices declined as a result of lower oil and commodity prices. Additionally, certain suppliers have elected to supply customers directly.\n \u2022 rates of technological change in the industries we serve. \nOur operations are most impacted by regional market price fluctuations of the primary feedstock materials, including crude oil and natural gas, and the downstream derivatives of these primary raw materials. Market price fluctuations of these primary raw materials directly impact the decisions of our product suppliers, specifically the manufacturing capacity made available for production of the products we distribute. As capacity or demand patterns change, we may experience a corresponding change in the average selling prices of the products we distribute.\nThe Notes were scheduled to mature on March 1, 2018. Effective as of the Closing Date, the Issuers redeemed all of the approximately $149.7 million principal amount of the Notes outstanding at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount (plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including the Closing Date). The Issuers had previously notified the holders of the Notes that they had elected to redeem the Notes on the Closing Date. The Issuers and the guarantors under the Notes have been released from their respective obligations under the Notes and the Indenture governing the Notes, effective as of the Closing Date.\n \u25e6 Taxes. \nChemicals\nOther income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 was $0.5 million and is primarily related to a $0.8 million reimbursement received for certain equipment as part of the eminent domain proceeding for our Franklin Park, Illinois facility offset by a $0.2 million loss related to sale of property and equipment. Other income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 was $11.4 million and was mainly due to a gain of $8.0 million recorded in connection with the release of escrow funds from a previous acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015, a gain of $1.7 million on the sale of old private fleet trucks and a gain of $0.6 million on the repurchase of the Notes.\nOctober 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 (Predecessor) Compared with Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2015 (Predecessor)\nGoodwill. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of March 31st and whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as operating segments or groupings of businesses one level below the operating segment level. Our operating segments are the same as the reporting units used in our goodwill impairment test. Relevant accounting guidance allows the consideration of qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment of goodwill has occurred. In the absence of sufficient qualitative factors, goodwill impairment is determined utilizing a two-step process. Under step one, if the fair value of a reporting unit (determined using a market approach if market prices are available, or alternatively, a discounted cash flow model) exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. The determination of the fair value of a reporting unit requires the use of key estimates about its future operating results, valuation multiples, discount rates and terminal growth rates. These key assumptions can change due to many factors and these changes can materially affect the fair value estimate and cause us to re-evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill. Once an impairment of goodwill has been recorded, it cannot be reversed.\n \u2022 achieving our operational return goals by maximizing cash conversion, optimizing our working capital requirements and maintaining an asset-lite model; and \nWe believe we provide a compelling value proposition to suppliers as a single bulk buyer of their products and by acting as an extension of their sales force by representing their brands and providing technical support to customers. We also believe we provide value to suppliers by distributing to larger customers through dedicated strategic accounts sales and marketing programs designed to solidify key relationships through enhanced customer service, efficient delivery and specialized value-added solutions. In addition to the value-added services mentioned above, we provide other services including dedicated stocking programs, vendor-managed inventory, quarterly customer demand forecasting, technical support and supply chain services. In addition, our understanding of key end markets presents additional opportunities with suppliers whose products are in substantial demand by customers situated in these end markets.\nEnvironmental Services. The Environmental Services line of business, in connection with certain waste disposal service companies, provides customers with comprehensive on-site and off-site hazardous and non-hazardous waste collection, recovery and arrangement for disposal services or recycling in North America, primarily in the U.S. These environmental services are offered through our network of distribution facilities which are used as transfer facilities or through a staff of dedicated on-site waste professionals.\n \u25e6 Inventory, \nCash flows from investing activities\nIncome tax expense\nIn March 2016, the Predecessor entered into a lease agreement for a new facility in Montgomery, Illinois. The lease has a term of 15 years, with annual payments beginning at $1.1 million per year. This lease agreement is accounted for as a capital lease and the lease term began in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.\nPlastics. The Plastics line of business distributes a broad product line consisting of commodity polymer products and prime engineering resins to plastics processors engaged in blow molding, extrusion, injection molding and rotation molding via railcars, bulk trucks, truckload boxes and less-than-truckload quantities. While our plastics products are distributed in more than 50 countries worldwide, we primarily distribute our plastics products in North America, EMEA and Asia. The Plastics line of business serves a broad cross section of industrial segments with a current focus on the healthcare and automotive end markets.\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2016 (Successor) Compared with Period October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016, Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 (Predecessor)\nUnder the ABL Facility, if as of any date of determination when Trigger Event Excess Availability (as defined in the ABL Facility) is below certain thresholds or upon certain defaults, the ABL Borrowers will be required to deposit cash on a daily basis from certain depository accounts in a collection account maintained with the administrative agent, which will be used to repay outstanding loans and cash collateralized letters of credit. At September 30, 2016, Trigger Event Excess Availability under the ABL Facility was $273.8 million, which was $230.3 million in excess of the $43.5 million threshold that would trigger the foregoing requirements.\nGross profit\nPredecessor Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018\n \u2022 In connection with the Business Combination, we have recognized certain contingent liabilities. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. \nOverview\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations and our borrowing availability under the ABL Facility. Cash flows generated from our operations are influenced by seasonal patterns of our business and other timing circumstances that can result in increases or decreases in working capital requirements for any given period during the course of our fiscal year. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from our operating activities will continue to be primarily dependent on purchasing and distributing chemical and plastic materials. Additionally, our ability to generate cash flows in the normal course of business can be significantly influenced by changing global and regional macroeconomic conditions. Borrowing availability under the ABL Facility is subject to a borrowing base generally comprised of eligible inventory, accounts receivable and cash and cash equivalents held in certain accounts and certain of its subsidiaries. Our availability under the ABL Facility is, therefore, potentially subject to fluctuations, depending on the value of the eligible assets in the borrowing base on a given valuation date. An inability to borrow under the ABL Facility may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nPlastics\nInterest expense, net\nPlastics\n \u25e6 Goodwill, and \nGeneral. We have operations in North America, EMEA and Asia. As a result, our business is subject to broad, global and regional macroeconomic factors. These factors include:\nSelling, general and administrative expenses from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 decreased $120.6 million or 36.6% compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to comparing periods that include the Predecessor's operating results for a 252 day period as compared to operating results of 365 days. Selling, general and administrative expenses per day for the period from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 decreased by approximately 8.2% compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily driven by lower employee and consulting costs as a result of execution on key productivity and cost management initiatives.\n \u2022 the general state of the economy, specifically inflationary or deflationary trends, GDP growth rates and commodities/feedstocks price movements; \nObligations under the ABL Facility are secured by a first priority lien on all ABL first lien collateral, including eligible inventory and accounts receivable of the ABL Borrowers, and a second priority lien on all Term Loan first lien collateral (other than a second priority security interest in, and mortgages on, any real property), including outstanding equity interests of the Borrower and certain of the other subsidiaries of Holdings, in each case, subject to certain limitations; provided, that no ABL Facility first lien collateral or Term Loan Facility first lien collateral owned by the Canadian Borrower secure the obligations owing under the U.S. tranche of the ABL Facility.\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2016 (Successor) Compared with Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2015 (Predecessor)\nStrategic Initiatives. We are focused on initiatives to enhance growth and profitability, including:\nWe distribute our broad product portfolio through a supply chain consisting of approximately 170 owned, leased or third party warehouses, rail terminals and tank terminals globally with a private fleet of approximately 1,000 units, primarily in North America. We currently employ approximately 2,520 employees globally. At September 30, 2016, we had approximately 500 sales professionals situated in North America, EMEA and Asia, including technical support, field managers and strategic account managers to assist our customers in the selection and application of commodity and specialty products for their end products and processes.\nUnder the ADA Purchase Agreement, Ashland agreed to retain the Retained Specified Remediation Liabilities. Ashland's obligation for these liabilities is not subject to any claim thresholds or deductibles other than expenses the Predecessor incurs arising out of the Other Retained Remediation Liabilities; if the Predecessor incurs expenses arising out of the Other Retained Remediation Liabilities, Ashland's indemnification obligation is subject to an individual claim threshold of $0.2 million and an aggregate claim deductible of $5.0 million. Ashland's indemnification obligation for the Retained Remediation Liabilities is subject to an aggregate ceiling of $75.0 million. Ashland's indemnification obligations resulting from its breach of any representation, warranty or covenant related to environmental matters (other than for liabilities relating to taxes or the breach of any fundamental representation or warranty) are generally limited by an individual claim threshold of $0.2 million, an aggregate claim deductible of $18.6 million and a ceiling of $93.0 million. Collectively, Ashland's indemnification obligations resulting from or relating to the Retained Remediation Liabilities, retained litigation liabilities, and the breach of Ashland's representations, warranties and covenants contained in the ADA Purchase Agreement (other than for liabilities relating to taxes or the breach of any fundamental representation or warranty) are subject to an aggregate ceiling of $139.5 million, and Ashland's total indemnification obligation under the ADA Purchase Agreement (other than for liabilities relating to taxes or any retained indebtedness) is subject to an aggregate ceiling in the amount of the purchase price for the Distribution Business net assets. Ashland's indemnification obligations under the ADA Purchase Agreement as described above terminated as of March 31, 2016, other than for the Retained Specified Remediation Liabilities and for the Other Retained Remediation liabilities reported to Ashland prior to March 31, 2016. As a result, any environmental remediation liabilities reported to Ashland after March 31, 2016 and not arising out of a Retained Remediation Liability will be liabilities of the Company.\nIncome tax expense\nAt September 30, 2016, we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\n\nOther income\nObligations under the Term Loan Facility are secured by a first priority lien on all Term Loan first lien collateral, including outstanding equity interests of the Borrower and certain of the other subsidiaries of Holdings, and a second priority lien on all ABL first lien collateral, including accounts receivable and inventory of the loan parties under the Term Loan Facility, subject to certain limitations.\nAs of the Closing Date, the Predecessor was in compliance with the covenants of the indenture governing the Notes.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 decreased $6.3 million or 1.9% compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses is approximately $12.7 million, including $3.3 million of depreciation and amortization expense, attributable to the estimated impact of two months of additional operations from the CSD Acquisition and six additional months of operations from the Archway Acquisition during fiscal year 2015. Beginning on July 1, 2015, we fully integrated Archway into our own operations. Excluding the impact of this $12.7 million, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $19.0 million in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to (i) a decrease of $5.6 million in consulting costs, (ii) lower travel costs of $4.1 million, (iii) lower employee costs of $3.3 million, (iv) lower bad debt expense of $2.8 million, primarily related to specific customer write-offs in fiscal year 2014, (v) other costs decrease of $2.4 million, primarily related to telecommunications expense and (vi) lower insurance costs of $1.9 million. Lower expenses were the result of our execution on key productivity and cost management initiatives. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $1.2 million associated with facility, equipment and vehicle investments made in fiscal year 2015, and an unfavorable foreign exchange variance over the prior fiscal year of $1.0 million primarily associated with fluctuations in the RMB exchange rate versus the U.S. dollar.\nIn addition to operating and non-operating cash requirements previously described, our longer-term liquidity needs are primarily related to our final maturity debt payments due in 2021 and 2023. Depending on market conditions and other factors, we may also consider alternative financing options, including, but not limited to, issuance of equity, issuance of new debt or refinancing of our existing debt obligations.\nAt September 30, 2016, we had $47.5 million in cash and cash equivalents of which $41.9 million was held by foreign subsidiaries, $36.9 million of which was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily in euros and RMB. At September 30, 2016, we had $6.5 million in China denominated in RMB. While the RMB is convertible into U.S. dollars, foreign exchange transactions are subject to approvals from the SAFE. We do not anticipate any significant adverse impact to overall liquidity from restrictions on cash and cash equivalents.\nOther\nGross profit declined $88.2 million from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to comparing periods that include the Predecessor's operating results for a 252 day period to operating results of 365 days. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the Chemicals line of business from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 was 12.8% as compared to 11.5% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to the positive impact during the period from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 of (i) our profitability initiatives, (ii) effective management of product costs in the deflationary environment, (iii) improved product mix and, (iv) the continued execution of cost saving efforts including better utilization of our private fleet, better management of certain warehouse costs and other operating improvements.\nIn terms of currency, the euro and the other European currencies weakened versus the U.S. dollar when comparing fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2015, which affected, among other items, the reported dollar revenues and gross profit from our European operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGross profit\n \u2022 complementing organic growth by pursuing attractive merger and acquisition opportunities and delivering value creation by leveraging our centralized platform while achieving increased geographic reach and providing enhanced product/service offerings; \nChemicals. The Chemicals line of business distributes specialty and industrial chemicals, additives and solvents to industrial users via railcars, barges, bulk tanker trucks, and as packaged goods in trucks. While our chemicals products are distributed in more than 50 countries worldwide, we primarily distribute our chemicals products in North America and Asia. In connection with the distribution of chemicals products, we provide value-added services such as custom blending, packaging and re-packaging, private-label manufacturing and product testing in the form of chemical analysis, product performance analysis and product development. While our Chemicals line of business serves multiple end markets, key end markets within the industrial space are household, industrial and institutional, performance coatings (including architectural coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers), lubricants, oil and gas and personal care.\nCertain of our vendor arrangements provide for purchase incentives based on us achieving a specified volume of purchases. We record the volume-based purchase incentives as a reduction of inventory costs (and related cost of sales) based on our purchases to date and our estimates of purchases for the remainder of the calendar year. We receive these incentives in the form of rebates that are payable only when our purchases equal or exceed the relevant calendar year target. The determination of these rebates at an interim date involves management judgment. As a result, our cost of sales may be affected if we earn an incentive toward the end of a year that we had not expected to earn in earlier periods or if we fail to earn an incentive that we had expected to earn and had recorded the incentive based on our prior estimates.\nSales and operating revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 decreased $2,883.4 million or 73.0%. The decrease was primarily attributable to comparing periods that include the acquired business' operating results for a 114 day period as compared to operating results of 365 days. Additionally, declines in revenue were driven by lower sales per shipping day and lower average selling prices in both our Chemicals and Plastics businesses as a result of the decline in oil and other commodity prices during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, as well as, weaker industrial demand.\nOther Long-Lived Assets. Property, plant and equipment and other intangibles with definite lives are tested for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. When an impairment test is performed and the undiscounted expected future cash flow is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. The factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating results, trends and prospects, as well as the effect of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n\nOur diverse array of product offerings allows us to provide many of our customers with a one-stop-shop resource for their chemicals and plastics needs. For customers with multiple locations, our centralized business model helps ensure consistency of product offerings and a single point of contact. Our services and full product offering allow for product customization, cost savings to customers on transaction and transportation costs and reliance on a single supplier to source all of a customer's diverse product requirements.\nIncome tax expense for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 was $1.2 million and is primarily attributable to foreign income tax expense on profitable foreign operations, primarily EMEA and Mexico. Successor and Predecessor income taxes are generally not comparable as the Predecessor was organized as a limited liability company and taxed as a partnership for U.S. income tax purposes. Predecessor income tax expense for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 was $3.9 million and primarily attributable to foreign income tax expense on profitable foreign operations, primarily Canada, Mexico, the U.K., and Spain.\nABL Facility\nIn accounting for business combinations, the purchase price paid to acquire a business is allocated to its assets and liabilities based on the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. These fair values are often estimated through the application of the income approach which requires us to estimate future cash inflows and outflows and apply an appropriate discount rate. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. A significant amount of judgment is involved in estimating the individual fair values of property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. The estimated fair values assigned to the net assets acquired could have a significant effect on our results of operations in the future. The estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, while we use all available information to make these fair value determinations and generally engage third party consultants for assistance, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value. During fiscal year 2016, we completed the Business Combination. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe monitor these factors routinely for both strategic and operational impacts.\nGross profit declined $168.7 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to comparing periods that include the acquired business' operating results for a 114 day period to operating results of 365 days. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the Chemicals line of business for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 was 11.7% as compared to 11.5% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase was attributable to a better pricing discipline and improved delivery costs to service our customers, offset by the recognition of $6.0 million of inventory step up recorded due to the Business Combination, and additional depreciation expense of approximately $1.6 million resulting from the step up in fair value of property, plant and equipment as a result of the Business Combination.\nFees paid to the lenders during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 in connection with the ABL Facility totaled $6.8 million and were recorded as debt issuance costs in Other non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheet to be amortized as interest expense over the remaining term of the ABL Facility.\nResults of Operations\nSales and operating revenues for the Plastics line of business for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 decreased $1,329.4 million or 70.9%. The decrease was primarily attributable to comparing periods that include the acquired business' operating results for a 114 day period as compared to operating results of 365 days. Sales per shipping day decreased 7.2% as average selling prices declined due to lower oil and other commodity prices, as well as, weaker industrial demand.\nGross profit declined $19.4 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to comparing periods that include the acquired business' operating results for a 114 day period to operating results of 365 days. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the Other line of business for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 was 22.2% as compared to 24.4% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to price compression associated with a competitive market.\nConsistent with industry standards, we may offer volume-based rebates to large customers if the customer purchases a specified volume with us over a specified time period. The determination of these rebates at an interim date involves management judgment. As a result, our revenues may be affected if a customer earns a rebate toward the end of a year that we had not expected or if its estimate of customer purchases are less than expected. We have the experience and access to relevant information that we believe is necessary to reasonably estimate the amounts of such deductions from gross revenues. We regularly review the information related to these estimates and adjusts our reserves accordingly if and when actual experience differs from previous estimates. We recognize the rebate obligation as a reduction of revenue based on the estimate of the total volume of purchases from a given customer over the specified period of time.\nNet cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 for the Predecessor, was $50.8 million. The net loss from continuing operations of $12.2 million, adjusted for gains on sale of assets, gain from proceeds of insurance claims, foreign currency gain and significant non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization expenses, debt issuance costs amortization, provision for bad debt, deferred income taxes, equity-based compensation charges and the foreign currency gain on purchase of additional equity interest in Nexeo Plaschem, collectively totaling $60.2 million, provided $48.0 million of cash inflow from continuing operations during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Additionally, cash flows from continuing operations were positively impacted by an increase in accounts payable and other accrued expenses of $44.7 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. However, the Predecessor experienced a negative impact on cash flows from continuing operations during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 resulting from a net increase in accounts and notes receivable of $31.2 million and a net increase in inventories of $9.9 million. The increase in accounts and notes receivable was driven primarily by timing of collections at period end. Additionally, the increase in accounts and notes receivable reflects the impact of activity related to CSD's and Archway's operations. There were no significant changes in billing terms or collection processes during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. The increase in inventories during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 reflected the impact of inventory purchases related to CSD's and Archway's operations.\n \u2022 general income growth and the consumption rates of products; and \nInvesting activities used $270.0 million of cash during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 for the Predecessor, primarily due to the closing of the Archway Acquisition for $128.7 million in April 2014, the closing of the CSD Acquisition for $96.4 million in December 2013 and capital expenditures of $49.9 million throughout the fiscal year, primarily related to additions to the Predecessor's private delivery fleet, facility improvements, and information technology investments.\n \u2022 unemployment levels; \nOther\n \u2022 fiscal and monetary policies of governments, including import and export tariffs, duties and other taxes; \nAt September 30, 2016, we had $117.7 million in borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility.

The decrease was primarily attributable to comparing periods that include the acquired business' operating results for a 114 day period as compared to operating results of 365 days. Sales per shipping day declined 22.2% as average selling prices declined as a result of lower oil and commodity prices. Additionally, certain suppliers have elected to supply customers directly.\nIncome tax expense\nOur operations in Asia are concentrated mainly in China. Recent GDP growth in China, as reported by the Chinese government, has been slower than their reported GDP growth over the past five years, primarily due to a weaker property sector, lower credit growth and weakened industrial production.\nIn terms of currency, the CAD declined against the U.S. dollar while comparing fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2015, which affected, among other items, the reported dollar revenues and gross profit from our Canadian operations.", "item_7_text": "Financing activities used $81.8 million of cash for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 for the Predecessor, primarily as a result of net payments on the Predecessor ABL Facility and the Notes of $13.8 million and $14.8 million, respectively, net payments of $12.1 million on short-term lines of credit available to Nexeo Plaschem and payments under the Predecessor Term Loan Facility of $6.7 million. In addition, financing activities included the purchase of the remaining equity interest in Nexeo Plaschem for $34.3 million.\nWhen compared to fiscal year 2015, we continue to see declining selling prices for the products we distributed during fiscal year 2016. Market forces and the intensity of competition have continued to apply pricing pressure.\n \u2022 Our fiscal year end was changed from December 31st to September 30th. As a result of this change, the consolidated financial statements presented within this Annual Report on Form 10-K include the period from October 1, 2015 through September 30, 2016. \nKey Factors Affecting our Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nCash flows from operating activities\nOn June 9, 2016, we entered into the ABL Facility which provides for asset-based secured credit financing. We also entered into the Term Loan Facility, which allows us to draw secured term loan financing.\n\nLiabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. Gain contingencies are not recorded until management determines it is certain that the future event will become or does become a reality.\n* not meaningful\nGross profit decreased $4.3 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Gross profit decreased $7.6 million, or 4.8%, as a result of the weakening of the exchange rates of various currencies versus the U.S. dollar in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014. Gross profit also decreased as the result of the overall deflationary price environment which caused us to sell inventory that was previously purchased at higher prices, primarily in the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2015. The decrease in gross profit was partially offset by the impact of certain profitability initiatives that were helping to reduce the impact of the price compression we were experiencing, and the decrease in operating expenses that resulted from the execution of cost saving efforts including better utilization of our private fleet, better management of certain warehouse costs and other operating improvements.\nWe consider an accounting policy to be critical when it requires the most difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are highly uncertain. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect our most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nOutlook\nThe following table summarizes our liquidity position as of September 30, 2016 for the Successor and September 30, 2015 for the Predecessor:\nCapital Expenditures\nGross profit declined $299.6 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to comparing periods that include the acquired business' operating results for a 114 day period to operating results of 365 days. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 was 10.2% as compared to 10.3% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily attributable to the recognition of $13.8 million associated with the inventory step up recorded due to the Business Combination, and additional depreciation expense of approximately $2.1 million resulting from the step up in fair value of property, plant and equipment as a result of the Business Combination.\nPlastics\nRevenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, products are shipped and title is transferred or services are provided to customers, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue for product sales is recognized at the time title and risk of loss transfer to the customer, based on the terms of the sale. For products delivered under our standard shipping terms, title and risk of loss transfer when the product is delivered to the customer's delivery site. For sales transactions designated Freight on Board shipping point, the customer assumes risk of loss and title transfers at the time of shipment. Deferred revenues may result from (i) delivery delays for products delivered under our standard shipping terms or (ii) from bill and hold or other arrangements with our customers. Sales are reported net of tax assessed by qualifying governmental authorities.\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 decreased $237.8 million or 72.2% compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to comparing periods that include the acquired business' operating results for a 114 day period as compared to operating results of 365 days. Selling, general and administrative expenses per day for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 decreased approximately 10.9% compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was driven primarily by lower employee and consulting costs as a result of execution on key productivity, certain cost management initiatives, and lower employee variable compensation costs. This decrease was partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense as a result of the fair value step up in assets associated with the Business Combination and increased audit fees as a result of the Business Combination's additional reporting requirements.\nGross profit declined $136.1 million from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to comparing periods that include the Predecessor's operating results for a 252 day period to operating results of 365 days. Gross profit as a percentage of sales from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 was 11.6% as compared to 10.3% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to the positive impact from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 of (i) certain profitability initiatives, (ii) improved product mix and (iii) the decrease in cost of sales and operating expenses driven by the execution of cost saving efforts, including better utilization of our private fleet, better management of certain warehouse costs and other operating improvements and lower costs for certain products, particularly commodities.\nWe are a global distributor of chemicals products in North America and Asia, and plastics products in North America, EMEA and Asia. In connection with the distribution of chemicals products, we provide value-added services such as custom blending, packaging and re-packaging, private-label manufacturing and product testing in the form of chemical analysis, product performance analysis and product development. We also provide on-site and off-site environmental services, including waste collection, recovery, arrangement for disposal services and recycling in North America, primarily the U.S., through our Environmental Services line of business. The Predecessor was a distributor of composites products in North America until July 1, 2014, when these operations were sold and as a result, activity associated with these operations is reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. We are organized into three lines of business (or operating segments): Chemicals, Plastics and Environmental Services. During fiscal year 2016, we distributed approximately 22,000 products into over 80 countries for approximately 1,300 suppliers to over 26,700 customers. Based on revenues for calendar year 2015, the Predecessor was ranked third in North America and fifth globally among the top 100 chemicals distributors, as reported by the Independent Chemical Information Service (or ICIS), one of the largest petrochemical market information providers.\nBased on current and anticipated levels of operations, capital spending projections and conditions in our markets, we believe that cash on hand, together with cash flows from operations and borrowings available under the ABL Facility, are adequate to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs as well as any debt service and other cash requirements for at least twelve months.\nOverview\nIndebtedness\nDeferred Taxes\nVolume-based pricing. We generally procure chemicals and plastics raw materials through purchase orders rather than under long-term contracts with firm commitments. Our arrangements with key producers and suppliers are typically embodied in agreements that we refer to as framework supply agreements. We work to develop strong relationships with a select group of producers and suppliers that complement our strategy based on a number of factors, including price, breadth of product offering, quality, market recognition, delivery terms and schedules, continuity of supply and each producer's strategic positioning. Our framework supply agreements with producers and suppliers typically renew annually and, while they generally do not provide for specific product pricing, some, primarily those related to our Chemicals line of business, include volume-based financial incentives through supplier rebates, which we earn by meeting or exceeding target purchase volumes.\nThe recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions are subject to various assumptions and judgment by us. If actual results differ from the estimates made by us in establishing or maintaining valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, the resulting change in the valuation allowance would generally impact earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the respective deferred tax asset. Additionally, the positions taken with regard to tax contingencies may be subject to audit and review by tax authorities, which may result in future taxes, interest and penalties.\nPredecessor Credit Facilities\nInvesting activities used $11.8 million of cash for the period from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 for the Predecessor, primarily due to capital expenditures of $14.2 million throughout the period, related primarily to facility improvements, additional information technology investments and vehicle additions. These expenditures were partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of assets of $2.4 million.\n (1) Short-term obligations primarily include the payment of $38.4 million outstanding under credit facilities available to Nexeo Plaschem and $6.6 million in principal installment payments under the Term Loan Facility and Long-term debt obligations include the payment of $117.7 million in outstanding principal (at September 30, 2016) under the ABL Facility and the payment of $646.8 million in remaining outstanding principal under the Term Loan Facility. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. \nLiabilities for environmental remediation costs are recognized when environmental assessments or remediation are probable and the associated costs can be reasonably estimated. Generally, the timing of these provisions coincides with the commitment to a formal plan of action or, if earlier, the divestment or closure of the relevant site. Environmental reserves are subject to numerous uncertainties that affect our ability to accurately estimate costs, or our share of costs if multiple parties are responsible. These uncertainties involve the legal, regulatory and enforcement parameters governing environmental assessment and remediation, the nature and extent of contamination at the site, the extent of required remediation efforts, the choice of remediation methodology, availability of insurance coverage and, in the case of a site with multiple responsible parties, the number and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties.\nFinancing activities used $121.5 million of cash for the period from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 for the Predecessor, primarily as a result of repaying long-term debt and capital leases of $417.3 million and the repayment of short-term debt of $17.1 million. These were offset by the issuance of long-term debt of $292.1 million and proceeds of short-term debt of $20.9 million.\nTransaction related costs\n (2) Estimated interest payments include cash interest payments and estimated commitment fees on long-term debt obligations. Variable rate interest payments were estimated using interest rates at September 30, 2016 held constant to maturity. \nSegment Overview\nSales and operating revenues for the Other line of business for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 decreased $2.7 million or 2.3%. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to decreased sales volumes of composite products in our Asia operations in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. This decrease in revenues was partially offset by new customer acquisitions as well as expanded operations with existing customers.\nEach line of business represents unique products and suppliers, and each line of business focuses on specific end markets within its industry based on a variety of factors including supplier or customer opportunities, expected growth and prevailing economic conditions. Across our Chemicals and Plastics lines of business there are numerous industry segments, end markets and sub markets that we may choose to focus on. These end markets may change from year to year depending on the underlying market economics, supplier focus, expected profitability and its strategic agenda.\nChemicals\nInflation. Our average selling prices rise in inflationary environments as producers and suppliers raise the market prices of the products that we distribute. During inflationary periods our customers maximize the amount of inventory they carry in anticipation of even higher prices and consequently, this environment of excess demand favorably impacts our volumes sold, revenues and gross profit due to the lag between rising prices and our cost of goods sold. The reverse is true in deflationary price environments. Deflationary forces create an environment of overcapacity, driving market prices of products downward, and we must quickly adjust inventories and buying patterns to respond to price declines. Our primary objective is to replace inventories at lower costs while maintaining or enhancing unit profitability.\nSales and operating revenues for the Other line of business for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 decreased $76.0 million or 65.0%. The decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to comparing periods that include the acquired business' operating results for a 114 day period as compared to operating results of 365 days. Revenues per working day increased 11.4% due to a favorable shift in product mix.\nOn June 9, 2016, the ABL Borrowers entered into the ABL Facility which provides for revolving credit financing including a U.S. Tranche of up to $505.0 million, a Canadian Tranche of up to the U.S. dollar equivalent of $40.0 million, and a FILO Tranche up to $30.0 million. Under the ABL Facility, up to $50.0 million in the case of the U.S. Tranche and $10.0 million in the case of the Canadian Tranche may be short-term borrowings upon same-day notice, referred to as swingline loans. The ABL Facility is unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by Holdings and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sub Holding. Additionally, Solutions, Holdings and Sub Holding are also co-borrowers under the U.S. Tranche and the FILO Tranche of the ABL Facility on a joint and several basis, and Nexeo Solutions Canada Corp. is the borrower under the Canadian Tranche. The ABL Facility matures on June 9, 2021. Provided no default or event of default then exists or would arise therefrom, the ABL Borrowers have the option, at the beginning of each quarter, to request that the ABL Facility be increased by an aggregate amount, when included with any incremental borrowings issued under the Term Loan Facility, not to exceed $175.0 million..\nCash flows from financing activities\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year differences are expected to reverse.\nIncome tax expense from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 was $4.2 million and attributable to income tax expense on profitable foreign operations, primarily Canada, EMEA, Puerto Rico and Mexico. Income tax expense for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 was $3.9 million and largely attributable to foreign income tax expense on profitable foreign operations, primarily Canada, Mexico, the U.K., and Spain.\nOther income\nInvesting activities provided $133.0 million of cash during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to withdrawing $501.1 million from the trust account offset by the cash paid to effect the Business Combination of $360.6 million, net of cash acquired, and the addition of property and equipment of $12.7 million, primarily related to facility improvements and information technology investments. These expenditures were partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of assets of $4.7 million and the reimbursement of $0.5 million received for certain equipment under an eminent domain proceeding related to one of our facilities.\nWe have an experienced management team with deep knowledge of the industry. We continue to implement strategies and invest significantly to build upon our strengths by creating industry-leading marketing capabilities, including our focus on specific end markets, sales force effectiveness tools, market-based pricing and geographic expansion.\nRevenue Recognition\nFinancing activities provided $166.5 million of cash for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 for the Predecessor, primarily as a result of the Predecessor Term Loan proceeds of $169.2 million and net borrowings under the Predecessor ABL Facility of $102.1 million. Proceeds from borrowings were partially offset by the purchases of additional equity interests in Nexeo Plaschem for $92.2 million, quarterly installments on the Predecessor Term Loan Facility of $6.3 million and net payments of $4.0 million on short-term lines of credit available to Nexeo Plaschem.\nSales and operating revenues for the Plastics line of business from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 decreased $683.9 million or 36.5%. The decrease was primarily attributable to comparing periods that include the Predecessor's operating results for a 252 day period as compared to operating results of 365 days. Sales per shipping day decreased 7.9% as average selling prices declined due to lower oil and other commodity prices as well as weaker industrial demand.\nTerm Loan Facility\nIncome tax expense for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 decreased $3.4 million or 46.6% compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Income tax expense for these fiscal years is primarily determined by the taxable income in foreign jurisdictions and certain U.S., Federal, state and local jurisdictions. The decrease in income tax expense in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 is largely attributed to the reduced profitability of our China operations.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations. We conduct our business on an international basis in multiple currencies. A portion of our sales and costs of sales are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. Strengthening of our subsidiaries' functional currency relative to the other currencies in which some transactions are denominated creates a negative impact on sales, but a positive impact on costs. Additionally, because we report our consolidated results in U.S. dollars, the results of operations and the financial position of our local international operations, which are generally reported in the relevant local currencies, are translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to our subsidiaries' functional currencies causes a negative impact on sales but a positive impact on costs.\nSome of our assets and liabilities, primarily cash, receivables, inventories and accounts payable, are impacted by inflation because they are indirectly affected by market prices of raw materials for our products. To the extent that we are able to manage our working capital in periods of changing prices, the overall impact of inflation on our net working capital is generally not significant.\nNet cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 was $3.2 million, based on a 114 day operating period. Net loss from continuing operations of $8.4 million, adjusted for loss on sale of property and equipment and significant non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization expenses, debt issuance costs amortization, transaction costs paid in stock, equity based compensation, and changes relating to contingent consideration liabilities, deferred income taxes, provision for bad debt and reimbursement for certain capital expenditures incurred in connection with eminent domain proceeding, collectively totaling $23.0 million, provided $14.6 million of cash inflow from continuing operations during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. Additionally, cash flows from continuing operations were impacted by an increase in accounts and notes receivable of $5.0 million, primarily driven by the timing of collections on accounts receivable during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. There have been no significant changes in billing terms or collection processes during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. Additionally, cash flows from operations were impacted by a net decrease of $19.4 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses, driven primarily by payment of approximately $29.4 million of transaction costs accrued by the Predecessor at the time of the closing of the Business Combination, partially offset by the timing of payments and a decrease in inventories of $12.5 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The decrease in inventories includes the decrease of $13.8 million related to the fair value adjustment to inventory as of the Closing Date, partially offset by a shift in inventory mix towards higher value plastics products.\nCash capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 for the Successor and from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 for the Predecessor were $12.7 million and $14.2 million, respectively, and related primarily to facility improvements and information technology investments. We expect our aggregate capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 (excluding acquisitions and any assets acquired via capital leases) to be approximately $25.0-$30.0 million. These expenditures are expected to be primarily related to fixed asset replacements, improvements to our information technology infrastructure and additions of equipment and vehicles.\nCash Flows\nNorth America\nThe ABL Facility includes a letter of credit sub-facility, which permits up to $200.0 million of letters of credit under the U.S. Tranche (which may be denominated in U.S. dollars, euros or other currencies approved by the administrative agent and the issuing bank) and up to the U.S. dollar equivalent of $10.0 million of letters of credit under the Canadian Tranche (which may be denominated in CAD only). The ABL Facility also contains a FILO Tranche which can be used by any non-Canadian foreign subsidiary for loans or letters of credit up to an aggregate amount not to exceed $30.0 million.\nOther\n\nGross profit declined $37.5 million from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to comparing periods that include the Predecessor's operating results for a 252 day period to operating results of 365 days. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the Plastics line of business from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 was 9.9% as compared to 8.3% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily the result of the continued impact of certain profitability initiatives that are helping to reduce the impact of the price compression and volume declines we are experiencing, improved product mix and the decrease in operating expenses that resulted from the continued execution of cost saving efforts including better utilization of our private fleet, better management of certain warehouse costs and other operating improvements.\nOur Chemicals, Plastics and Environmental Services lines of business compete with national, regional and local companies throughout North America. Our Chemicals and Plastics lines of business compete with other distribution companies in Asia, and the Plastics line of business also competes with other distribution companies in EMEA. In addition, in some of the markets in which we operate, large chemical producers may elect to distribute their products directly to end-user customers. Competition is based primarily on the diversity and quality of the product portfolio, service offerings, reliability of supply, technical support, price and delivery capabilities. The accounting policies used to account for transactions in each of the lines of business are the same as those used to account for transactions at the corporate level.\nThe following table sets forth the major categories of our cash flows for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 for the Successor, and from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 and fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 for the Predecessor.\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 decreased $19.2 million or 104.3% compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. The loss from discontinued operations during fiscal year 2015 was the result of certain expenses incurred to terminate activity and relationships associated with these operations. Income from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 was primarily related to the gain recorded on the Composites Sale of $14.3 million.\nInterest expense, net\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. To the extent this discussion and analysis contains forward- looking statements, these statements involve risks and uncertainties. While management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made, there can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that are anticipated. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" and \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements\".\nA brief description of each of our lines of business follows:\n \u25e6 Plant, property and equipment, \n \u2022 In connection with the Business Combination, certain assets and liabilities had fair value adjustments applied to the Predecessor's consolidated financial statements on the Closing Date, most notably: \nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe incurred $0.1 million in transaction related costs for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 compared to $12.6 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, a decrease of $12.5 million. Transaction related costs incurred during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 related primarily to legal and consulting costs incurred in connection with the CSD Acquisition and the Archway Acquisition, which closed on December 1, 2013 and April 1, 2014, respectively.\nSales and operating revenues\nSee Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.\nOur operating cash requirements consist principally of inventory purchases, trade credit extended to customers, labor, occupancy costs and transportation and delivery costs. Non-operating cash requirements include debt service requirements, acquisition-related costs and capital expenditures.\n (6) Liabilities for contingent consideration are related (i) to the TRA that we entered into with the Selling Equityholders and (ii) the Deferred Cash Consideration that will be paid to Selling Equityholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement. The amount included in the table above for the Deferred Cash Consideration is based on the undiscounted expected value of the payment and is currently included in the 4-5 Years column based on the final payment date of June 9, 2021 as defined in the Merger Agreement. However, as further defined in the Merger Agreement, payments could be required to be made by the Company prior to June 9, 2021. The timing of payments associated with the liability for the contingent consideration related to the TRA is based on expected undiscounted cash flows in future periods, and may change based on actual results. See Notes 3 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements. \nTransaction related costs\nSales and operating revenues\nNet cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the period from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 for the Predecessor was $69.5 million, based on a 252 day operating period. Net loss from continuing operations of $13.9 million, adjusted for gain on sale of property and equipment and significant non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization expenses, debt issuance costs, bad debt, equity based compensation, deferred income taxes and gain on debt extinguishment, collectively totaling $46.2 million, resulted in $32.3 million of cash inflow from continuing operations for the period from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016. Additionally, cash flows from continuing operations were positively impacted by a decrease in accounts and notes receivable of $34.4 million, increase in accounts payable of $13.4 million and a decrease in inventory of $8.4 million. These amounts were offset by a decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $9.7 million and a change in other current assets and other operating assets and liabilities of $9.0 million.\nThe North American economic environment has been relatively stable during fiscal year 2016. Although U.S. GDP has increased in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015, and the inflation rate has averaged 1% for the majority of fiscal year 2016, consumer spending, still-sluggish business investment and a slow housing sector have negatively impacted GDP. The U.S. Industrial Production Index, which more closely correlates to the chemical and plastics distribution industry, for fiscal year 2016 indicates a negative economic industry-related environment as compared to fiscal year 2015.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nABL Facility\nNet interest expense for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 increased $1.1 million or 1.7% compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Interest expense was primarily related to the Predecessor Term Loan Facility, the Notes and the Predecessor ABL Facility, along with the amortization of the costs associated with issuing the debt. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to additional borrowings under the Predecessor Term Loan Facility as a result of the amendment entered into in the second quarter of fiscal year 2014. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense related to lower short-term and Predecessor ABL Facility borrowings outstanding during fiscal year 2015.\nChemicals\nPrice fluctuations. The prices at which we resell the products we distribute in our Chemicals and Plastics lines of business generally fluctuate in accordance with the prices that we pay for these products. Product prices we pay are largely driven by the underlying global and regional economic conditions that drive the prices of two primary raw materials of production: crude oil (primarily naphtha) and natural gas (primarily ethane). These two raw material sources are used in the production of propylene and ethylene which are key feedstocks used in over 90% of organic-based commodity and specialty chemicals, as well as in the subsequent production of the intermediate plastics products we distribute. The prices of these feedstocks are also affected by other factors including choices made by feedstock producers for uses of these feedstocks (e.g., as an ingredient in gasoline versus a feedstock to the chemical industry), the capacity devoted to production of these feedstocks and other macroeconomic factors that impact the producers. As a distributor, the prices of these feedstocks are not in our control. However, we are generally able to pass on finished good price increases and decreases to our customers in accordance with the fluctuations in our product costs and transportation-related costs (e.g., fuel costs). As a result, movements in our sales revenue and cost of sales tend to correspond with changes in our product prices. Additionally, as capacity or demand patterns change, we typically experience a corresponding change in the average selling prices of the products we distribute. Our gross profit margins generally decrease in deflationary price environments because we are selling inventory that was previously purchased at higher prices. Alternatively, our gross profit margins generally increase during inflationary pricing environments because we are able to sell inventory that was previously purchased at lower prices. The extent to which profitability increases or decreases, however, also depends on the relative speed at which selling prices adjust in relation to inventory costs. As a logistics provider, oil price movements also typically impact our transportation and delivery costs.\nPlastics\nOther income from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 was $2.9 million and was primarily due to a gain of $2.0 million in the sale of old private fleet tractors that were replaced with tractors under the Ryder Lease and a $0.6 million gain on the repurchase of $9.5 million of our Notes. See Notes 5 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements. Other income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 was $11.4 million and was mainly due to a gain of $8.0 million recorded in connection with the release of escrow funds from a previous acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015, a gain of $1.7 million on the sale of old private fleet trucks and a gain of $0.6 million on the repurchase of the Notes.\nSales and operating revenues for the Plastics line of business for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 decreased $225.5 million or 10.7%. Revenue decreased $105.9 million, or approximately 5.0%, as a result of the weakening of the exchange rates of various currencies versus the U.S. dollar in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014. The revenue decrease was also attributable to volume declines in our operations in EMEA and China, which were the result of softer demand driven by lower oil prices in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014, as well as pricing pressure in our operations in North America and EMEA. Furthermore, revenue decreased as a result of the decision to stop certain transactions that were not meeting our profitability thresholds or were not consistent with our long-term strategy, including a decision made late in fiscal year 2014 to stop serving certain trader business in China. The overall revenue decrease was partially offset by the impact of certain profitability initiatives that are helping to reduce the impact of the price compression we were experiencing, as well as slight volume increases in our operations in North America in both commodity and specialty products.\n (4) Operating lease obligations represent payments for a variety of facilities and equipment under non-cancellable operating lease agreements, including office buildings, transportation equipment, warehouses and storage facilities and other equipment. \nOther\nOn July 1, 2014, the Predecessor sold its North American composites operations. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, these operations are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented and are excluded from the segment analysis tables and discussions below.\n (5) Purchase obligations are related to (i) certain IT-related contracts, (ii) non-cancellable equipment orders and (iii) estimated obligation costs to relocate employees or new hires in various U.S. locations, primarily in The Woodlands, Texas. The relocations are assumed to be completed within one year, although it is not practicable to establish definite completion dates for each employee's relocation. \nOther\nSales and operating revenues\nChemicals\nSales and operating revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 decreased $565.4 million or 12.5%. The decrease in revenues was attributable to lower average selling prices and lower sales volumes in both our Chemicals and Plastics lines of business primarily as a result of the decline in oil prices during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. Additionally, revenue decreased as a result of the decision to stop certain transactions in North America and China that were not meeting our profitability thresholds or were not consistent with our long-term strategy, including a decision made late in fiscal year 2014 to stop serving certain trader business in China. Furthermore, revenue decreased by $121.4 million, or 2.7%, as a result of the weakening of the exchange rates of various currencies versus the U.S. dollar in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014. The decrease in revenue was partially offset by the impact to our Chemicals line of business of an additional six months of operations from both the Archway Acquisition and an additional two months of operations from the CSD Acquisition in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, which collectively contributed $93.9 million.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2015 (Predecessor) Compared with Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2014 (Predecessor)\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nNet cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 for the Predecessor, was $154.7 million. Net income from continuing operations of $21.2 million, adjusted for gains on sale of assets, gain from debt extinguishment and significant non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization expenses, debt issuance costs amortization, provision for bad debt, inventory impairment, deferred income taxes and equity-based compensation charges, collectively totaling $64.4 million, provided $85.6 million of cash inflow from continuing operations during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. Additionally, cash flows from continuing operations were impacted by a decrease in accounts and notes receivable of $109.7 million, driven by lower sales volumes experienced during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, falling average selling prices and timing of collections at year end. There were no significant changes in billing terms or collection processes during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. Additionally, cash flows from operations were impacted by a net decrease of $98.9 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses, primarily driven by lower inventory purchases due to lower volumes. The decrease in inventory of $50.5 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 reflects the impact of lower prices for inventory purchases as well as improved inventory management. Additionally, there was a decrease in other current assets of $8.2 million partially due to a reduction in inventory prepayments.\nWe have long-standing relationships with major chemicals and plastics producers and suppliers, a strong geographic presence and supply chain network and a relatively stable customer base that benefits from the service and distribution value we provide. The products we distribute are used in a broad cross section of manufacturing industries, in various end markets and customer segments within those industries, including the household, industrial and institutional, lubricants, performance coatings (including architectural coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers), automotive, healthcare, personal care, oil and gas and construction end markets.\nOur consolidated financial statements reflect a number of significant estimates that impact the carrying values of assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenue and expenses. We make these estimates based on historical experience and on other judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates, judgments and assumptions form the basis for our determinations as to the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n (3) Capital lease obligations represent future payments on capital lease agreements, including lease payments on all tractors under the Ryder Lease. The amounts above include executory costs of $2.1 million per year, for aggregate executory costs totaling $12.6 million. Additionally, the amounts include decreasing annual interest payments ranging from $1.2 million to $0.1 million, for aggregate interest payments totaling $4.9 million. We are permitted to terminate the lease of an individual tractor on the anniversary of its delivery date, provided that certain conditions are met. In the event we terminate the lease of an individual tractor in accordance with the terms of the Ryder Lease, we may elect to purchase the individual tractor at a predetermined residual value or return the tractor to Ryder, subject to an adjustment based on the then-current market value of the individual tractor. Amounts also include payments under the new facility lease in Montgomery, Illinois, which began in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. See Notes 5 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements. \n* not meaningful\nThe Predecessor took delivery of 106 tractors under the Ryder Lease during the period from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 and made capital lease payments of $2.9 million. The Successor took delivery of the final tractor and made capital lease payments of $1.8 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. In connection with the delivery of these tractors, $13.9 million of equipment cost and corresponding capital lease obligations were reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the Predecessor. The initial total equipment cost and corresponding capital lease obligations associated with the Ryder Lease were $25.9 million. We are permitted to terminate the lease of an individual tractor on the anniversary of its delivery date, provided that certain conditions are met. In the event we terminate the lease of an individual tractor in accordance with the terms of the Ryder Lease, we may elect to purchase the individual tractor at a predetermined residual value or return the tractor to Ryder, subject to an adjustment based on the then-current market value of the individual tractor. See Notes 5 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements.\nSupplier Rebates\nContingencies and Environmental Costs\nThe following is a summary of GDP and oil price fluctuations in our various regions of operations by fiscal quarter.\n\nWe are organized into three lines of business, or operating segments: Chemicals, Plastics and Environmental Services. Our lines of business market to different sets of customers operating in an array of industries, with various end markets and customer segments within those industries. For segment presentation and disclosure purposes, our Chemicals and Plastics lines of business constitute separate reportable segments while the Environmental Services line of business, which does not meet the materiality threshold for separate disclosure is included in the \"Other\" segment.\n \u2022 government regulation and changes in governments; \nInterest expense, net\nBased on the indemnification discussed above, we do not currently have any environmental or remediation reserves for matters that were covered by the ADA Purchase Agreement. However, if we were to incur expenses related to the Other Retained Remediation Liabilities, we would be responsible for the first $5.0 million in aggregate expenses relating thereto prior to the receipt of any indemnification from Ashland. In addition, if any Retained Specified Remediation Liability ultimately exceeds the liability ceilings described above, we would be responsible for such excess amounts. In either of these scenarios, and for liabilities associated with our operation of the business, we would be required to take appropriate environmental or remediation reserves.\nEMEA\n\nGross profit declined $111.5 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to comparing periods that include the acquired business' operating results for a 114 day period to operating results of 365 days. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the Plastics line of business for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 was 8.0% as compared to 8.3% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to the recognition of $7.8 million related to the inventory step up recorded due to the Business Combination and additional depreciation expense of approximately $0.5 million resulting from the step up in fair value of property, plant and equipment as a result of the Business Combination.\nGross profit increased $11.7 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to the impact of the Archway Acquisition and the CSD Acquisition, coupled with the positive impact during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 from our profitability initiatives, favorable changes in product mix and efforts to reduce operating costs, which offset the declines in volume and average selling prices described above. Additionally, gross profit during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 included $1.4 million from the favorable settlement of claims with suppliers, offset by the impact of a non-cash inventory impairment charge of $1.6 million associated with our operations in Asia, both of which occurred during the first quarter of fiscal year 2015. The inventory impairment was driven primarily by the impact of the significant decline in oil prices. Gross profit during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 included the effect of an inventory step-up charge of $1.2 million resulting from the CSD Acquisition and non-cash impairment charges of $1.4 million allocated to the Chemicals line of business associated with the closure of two facilities, offset by the favorable impact of $5.9 million of insurance proceeds received during that period in connection with the fire at our Garland facility.\nGross profit increased $6.3 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Overall, this increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to the impact of the Archway Acquisition and the CSD Acquisition on our Chemicals line of business, improved profitability resulting from the positive impact in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 of certain pricing initiatives and the decrease in certain operating expenses, such as, (i) lower costs for products, (ii) lower sales volumes in our Plastics and Chemicals lines of business and (iii) a decrease in certain operating expenses, driven by the execution of cost saving efforts, including better utilization of our private fleet, better management of certain warehouse costs and other operating improvements. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by a decrease of $8.4 million, or approximately 2.1%, as a result of the weakening of the exchange rates of various currencies versus the U.S. dollar in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014.\nPrior to the Business Combination, WLRH operated as a special purpose acquisition company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or assets. As a result, operations were minimal before the Business Combination and are not presented in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014. After the Business Combination our results of operations are not directly comparable to historical results of the operations for the periods presented, primarily because:\n* not meaningful\n\n \u2022 attracting and retaining the talent we need to maintain the capabilities that define a market leader. \nSales and operating revenues for the Chemicals line of business for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 decreased $337.2 million or 14.7%. The revenue decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in sales volumes of our commodity products in our operations in North America and Asia, which resulted in part from the decision to stop certain transactions that were not meeting our profitability thresholds or were not consistent with our long-term strategy, including a decision made late in fiscal year 2014 to stop serving certain trader business in China. Additionally, across the multiple product categories sold, average selling prices declined in our Asia and North America operations, driven by the decline in oil prices during fiscal year 2015. While average selling prices declined in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 due to the deflationary environment, these price declines were partially offset in North America by the positive significant impact of certain pricing initiatives, as well as favorable changes in product mix. The decrease in revenue was also partially offset by the impact of an additional six months of operations from both the Archway Acquisition and an additional two months of operations from the CSD Acquisition in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, which collectively contributed $93.9 million.\nOverall GDP growth remains below 2.0% for many of the countries in which we operate. This slow recovery, together with lower average oil prices, has resulted in lower demand, and by extension, lower sales volumes and average selling prices when compared to the prior fiscal year. In terms of currency, the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen over the prior fiscal year against most other currencies in which we transact. As a result of these factors, reported dollar revenues and gross profit have been negatively impacted in many of our regions' operations.\n \u25e6 Intangible assets, \nOther\nCredit Facilities\nIn Europe, we conduct business primarily in the Western European countries. While the outlook for economic growth in Europe improved beginning late in fiscal year 2015, the region did experience a slight downturn late in fiscal year 2016, mainly as a result of U.K.'s decision to exit the European Union. Overall GDP growth has remained slow with many Western European nations experiencing growth below 3.0% and current developments adding uncertainty to Europe's economic prospects.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nTransaction related costs\nOn June 9, 2016, Neon Finance Company LLC (which was subsequently merged with and into Solutions) entered into the Term Loan Facility that provides secured debt financing in an aggregate principal amount of up to $655.0 million and the right, at our option, to request additional tranches of term loans in an aggregate principal amount, when included with any incremental borrowings issued under the ABL Facility, amount up to $175.0 million, plus unlimited additional amounts such that the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding at the time of incurrence does not cause the consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio, calculated on a pro forma basis, to exceed 4.1 to 1.0. Availability of such additional tranches of term loans are subject to the absence of any default, and among other things, the receipt of commitments by existing or additional financial institutions. Proceeds of $651.7 million, net of discount of $3.3 million were received in connection with the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility matures on June 9, 2023.\n \u2022 maintaining our efforts on cost improvement through execution of our transportation strategy, warehouse productivity gains, corporate selling, general and administrative operational efficiencies and optimization of our customer coverage model; \nPlastics\nSales and operating revenues from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 decreased $1,609.0 million or 40.7%. The decrease was primarily attributable to comparing periods that include the Predecessor's operating results for a 252 day period as compared to operating results of 365 days. Additionally, declines in revenue were driven by lower sales per shipping day and lower average selling prices in both our Chemicals and Plastics businesses as a result of the decline in oil and other commodity prices from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016, as well as, weaker industrial demand.\nChemicals\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration obligations\nWe incurred $33.4 million in transaction related costs from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016. These costs were primarily related to legal and consulting costs incurred in connection with the Business Combination.\nAt September 30, 2016, amounts due under our contractual commitments were as follows:\nInvesting activities used $31.5 million of cash during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 for the Predecessor, primarily due to capital expenditures of $35.6 million throughout the fiscal year, primarily related to facility improvements, information technology investments and vehicle additions and replacements. These expenditures were partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of assets of $4.1 million.\nInterest expense, net for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 was $14.3 million and is primarily related to the debt acquired in connection with the Business Combination, along with the amortization of the costs associated with issuing the debt. Interest expense, net for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 was $64.7 million and is primarily related to the Predecessor debt, along with the amortization of the costs associated with issuing the debt. The decrease was primarily due to comparing periods that include operating results for a 114 day period as compared to operating results of 365 days.\nGeneral and regional economic conditions. The consumption of chemicals and plastics in the broad industry segments and end markets that we serve generally corresponds to the level of production of goods and services in the global economy, amplified by the regional economies where we have commercial operations. As a result, when general economic conditions improve or deteriorate, our volumes tend to fluctuate accordingly. We manage our cost structure in line with general economic conditions, but our volumes and profitability are ultimately correlated with the underlying demand for the end-products of the industries we serve.\nGross profit declined $10.4 million from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to comparing periods that include the Predecessor's operating results for a 252 day period to operating results of 365 days. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the Other line of business from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 was 22.2% as compared to 24.4% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to higher costs related to new and expanded operations coupled with lower margins on recycled materials as the result of a decline in market value of the materials and some price compression associated with a competitive market.\nInterest expense, net from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 and for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 was $42.2 million and $64.7 million, respectively. Interest expense, net is primarily related to the Predecessor debt, along with the amortization of the costs associated with issuing the debt. The decrease was primarily due to comparing periods that include the Predecessor's operating results for a 252 day period as compared to operating results of 365 days.\nOther income\nThe Successor period includes operating results of the acquired business from June 9, 2016 through September 30, 2016 and operating results of WLRH for the full fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, whereas, the Predecessor period represents the full fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 of only the Predecessor's operating results.\nThe net gain of $11.2 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 is related to the contingent consideration associated with the Deferred Cash Consideration and the TRA. See Notes 3 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements.\nPlastics\nWe incurred $21.3 million in transaction related costs for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. These costs were related to legal and consulting costs incurred in connection with the Business Combination.\nFees paid to the lenders during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 in connection with the Term Loan Facility totaled $18.5 million and were recorded as a reduction of the debt balance to be amortized as interest expense over the remaining term of the Term Loan Facility.\nGross profit\nWe are generally the primary obligor in sales transactions with our customers, retain inventory risk during transit and assume credit risk for amounts billed to our customers. Accordingly, we recognize revenue primarily based on the gross amount billed to our customers. In sales transactions where we are not the primary obligor and do not retain inventory risk, we recognize revenue on a net basis by recognizing only the commission we retain from such sales and including that commission in sales and operating revenues in our consolidated statements of operations.\nBusiness Combinations\nSales and operating revenues for the Other line of business from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 decreased $35.4 million or 30.3%. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to comparing periods that include the Predecessor's operating results for a 252 day period as compared to operating results of 365 days. Revenues per working day increased 1.1% due to new customer acquisitions as well as expanded operations with existing customers.\nDuring fiscal year 2016, global markets have generally been sluggish and recovery has been slow as the citizens of the U.K. approved the exit of the U.K. from the European Union, while the Asia-Pacific economy projected for a decline. The U.S. economy has stabilized, however, industry demand has decreased in this region as well. Although the overall global market has been bearish, through the use of our pricing tools and discipline, we have been able to offset some of the effects of the recent global deflationary environment.\n \nAt September 30, 2016, we had $653.4 million in borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan Facility. We are required to make early principal payments on an annual basis, commencing with the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017, if cash flows for the year, as defined in the agreement, exceed certain levels specified in the agreement. Interest expense related to the Term Loan Facility, excluding original issue discount amortization and amortization of debt issuance costs was $10.9 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \u2022 The fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 only includes 114 days of the acquired business' operating activities as a result of the consummation of the Business Combination on June 9, 2016. \nThe market prices for the products we sell in Europe are closely correlated to the cost of Brent Crude Oil as these operations are primarily based on the distribution of commodity plastics products and most products are sourced in Europe. Consistent with the continuous decline in average oil prices during fiscal year 2015 and into fiscal year 2016, our operations in Europe experienced a decline in average selling prices.\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.\nOther income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 increased $6.0 million or 111.1% compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Other income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 included (i) a gain of $8.0 million recorded in connection with the release of escrow funds from the CSD Acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015, (ii) a gain of $1.7 million on the sale of old private fleet trucks and (iii) a gain of $0.6 million on the repurchase of our Notes. Other income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 was primarily related to a gain of $4.0 million recorded in connection with insurance proceeds related to the fire at our Garland facility.\n \u2022 expanding margins through mix enhancement, disciplined pricing execution, platform scalability and end market diversification; \nAs a result of the factors listed above, historical results of operations and other financial data, as well as period-to-period comparisons of these results, may not be comparable or indicative of future operating results or future financial condition.\nFinancing activities used $88.9 million of cash during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, primarily as a result of repaying Predecessor long-term debt of $767.3 million, repayment of long-term debt of $205.4 million and the payment of debt issuance costs of $25.3 million. These were offset by the issuance of long-term debt of $972.5 million and proceeds of short-term debt of $13.3 million. The Company also issued common stock as consideration for the Business Combination of $234.9 million and redeemed stock of $298.5 million.\nChemicals\nLiquidity\nIn addition to cash flows generated from its operations, the Predecessor's sources of liquidity included borrowings under the Predecessor Credit Facilities. The Predecessor's ABL Facility was scheduled to mature on July 11, 2017 and the Predecessor Term Loan Facility was scheduled to mature on September 9, 2017. As of the Closing Date, the Predecessor was in compliance with the covenants of the Predecessor Credit Facilities. In connection with the completion of the Business Combination, a principal payment of $617.5 million was made and all of the Predecessor's outstanding indebtedness and other obligations under the Predecessor Credit Facilities were fully discharged.\nGross profit decreased $1.1 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 primarily due to decreased sales volumes of composite products in our Asia operations compared to fiscal year 2014 partially offset by an increase driven by new customer acquisitions as well as expanded operations with existing customers.\nAt September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with the covenants of the Credit Facilities.\nCertain Factors Affecting Comparability to Prior Period Financial Results\nIn terms of currency, the RMB declined against the U.S. dollar when comparing fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2015, which affected, among other items, the reported dollar revenues and gross profit from our China operations. However, we experienced an increase in sales revenue in China for fiscal year 2016 due to an increase in volume sales related to increased sales to historical customers and additional sales to new customers.\nThe Company is the result of the Business Combination between WLRH and Holdings that closed on June 9, 2016. The \"Successor\" financial information reflects the combined operations of WLRH for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 and the operations of Holdings after the Closing Date, after purchase price allocations. The \"Predecessor\" financial information reflects the operations of Holdings prior to the Closing Date of the Business Combination.\nSales and operating revenues for the Chemicals line of business from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 decreased $889.7 million or 45.5%. The decrease was primarily attributable to comparing periods that include the Predecessor's operating results for a 252 day period as compared to operating results of 365 days. Sales per shipping day declined 21.0% as average selling prices declined as a result of lower oil and commodity prices. Additionally, certain suppliers have elected to supply customers directly.\n \u2022 rates of technological change in the industries we serve. \nOur operations are most impacted by regional market price fluctuations of the primary feedstock materials, including crude oil and natural gas, and the downstream derivatives of these primary raw materials. Market price fluctuations of these primary raw materials directly impact the decisions of our product suppliers, specifically the manufacturing capacity made available for production of the products we distribute. As capacity or demand patterns change, we may experience a corresponding change in the average selling prices of the products we distribute.\nThe Notes were scheduled to mature on March 1, 2018. Effective as of the Closing Date, the Issuers redeemed all of the approximately $149.7 million principal amount of the Notes outstanding at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount (plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including the Closing Date). The Issuers had previously notified the holders of the Notes that they had elected to redeem the Notes on the Closing Date. The Issuers and the guarantors under the Notes have been released from their respective obligations under the Notes and the Indenture governing the Notes, effective as of the Closing Date.\n \u25e6 Taxes. \nChemicals\nOther income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 was $0.5 million and is primarily related to a $0.8 million reimbursement received for certain equipment as part of the eminent domain proceeding for our Franklin Park, Illinois facility offset by a $0.2 million loss related to sale of property and equipment. Other income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 was $11.4 million and was mainly due to a gain of $8.0 million recorded in connection with the release of escrow funds from a previous acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015, a gain of $1.7 million on the sale of old private fleet trucks and a gain of $0.6 million on the repurchase of the Notes.\nOctober 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 (Predecessor) Compared with Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2015 (Predecessor)\nGoodwill. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of March 31st and whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as operating segments or groupings of businesses one level below the operating segment level. Our operating segments are the same as the reporting units used in our goodwill impairment test. Relevant accounting guidance allows the consideration of qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment of goodwill has occurred. In the absence of sufficient qualitative factors, goodwill impairment is determined utilizing a two-step process. Under step one, if the fair value of a reporting unit (determined using a market approach if market prices are available, or alternatively, a discounted cash flow model) exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. The determination of the fair value of a reporting unit requires the use of key estimates about its future operating results, valuation multiples, discount rates and terminal growth rates. These key assumptions can change due to many factors and these changes can materially affect the fair value estimate and cause us to re-evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill. Once an impairment of goodwill has been recorded, it cannot be reversed.\n \u2022 achieving our operational return goals by maximizing cash conversion, optimizing our working capital requirements and maintaining an asset-lite model; and \nWe believe we provide a compelling value proposition to suppliers as a single bulk buyer of their products and by acting as an extension of their sales force by representing their brands and providing technical support to customers. We also believe we provide value to suppliers by distributing to larger customers through dedicated strategic accounts sales and marketing programs designed to solidify key relationships through enhanced customer service, efficient delivery and specialized value-added solutions. In addition to the value-added services mentioned above, we provide other services including dedicated stocking programs, vendor-managed inventory, quarterly customer demand forecasting, technical support and supply chain services. In addition, our understanding of key end markets presents additional opportunities with suppliers whose products are in substantial demand by customers situated in these end markets.\nEnvironmental Services. The Environmental Services line of business, in connection with certain waste disposal service companies, provides customers with comprehensive on-site and off-site hazardous and non-hazardous waste collection, recovery and arrangement for disposal services or recycling in North America, primarily in the U.S. These environmental services are offered through our network of distribution facilities which are used as transfer facilities or through a staff of dedicated on-site waste professionals.\n \u25e6 Inventory, \nCash flows from investing activities\nIncome tax expense\nIn March 2016, the Predecessor entered into a lease agreement for a new facility in Montgomery, Illinois. The lease has a term of 15 years, with annual payments beginning at $1.1 million per year. This lease agreement is accounted for as a capital lease and the lease term began in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.\nPlastics. The Plastics line of business distributes a broad product line consisting of commodity polymer products and prime engineering resins to plastics processors engaged in blow molding, extrusion, injection molding and rotation molding via railcars, bulk trucks, truckload boxes and less-than-truckload quantities. While our plastics products are distributed in more than 50 countries worldwide, we primarily distribute our plastics products in North America, EMEA and Asia. The Plastics line of business serves a broad cross section of industrial segments with a current focus on the healthcare and automotive end markets.\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2016 (Successor) Compared with Period October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016, Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 (Predecessor)\nUnder the ABL Facility, if as of any date of determination when Trigger Event Excess Availability (as defined in the ABL Facility) is below certain thresholds or upon certain defaults, the ABL Borrowers will be required to deposit cash on a daily basis from certain depository accounts in a collection account maintained with the administrative agent, which will be used to repay outstanding loans and cash collateralized letters of credit. At September 30, 2016, Trigger Event Excess Availability under the ABL Facility was $273.8 million, which was $230.3 million in excess of the $43.5 million threshold that would trigger the foregoing requirements.\nGross profit\nPredecessor Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018\n \u2022 In connection with the Business Combination, we have recognized certain contingent liabilities. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. \nOverview\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations and our borrowing availability under the ABL Facility. Cash flows generated from our operations are influenced by seasonal patterns of our business and other timing circumstances that can result in increases or decreases in working capital requirements for any given period during the course of our fiscal year. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from our operating activities will continue to be primarily dependent on purchasing and distributing chemical and plastic materials. Additionally, our ability to generate cash flows in the normal course of business can be significantly influenced by changing global and regional macroeconomic conditions. Borrowing availability under the ABL Facility is subject to a borrowing base generally comprised of eligible inventory, accounts receivable and cash and cash equivalents held in certain accounts and certain of its subsidiaries. Our availability under the ABL Facility is, therefore, potentially subject to fluctuations, depending on the value of the eligible assets in the borrowing base on a given valuation date. An inability to borrow under the ABL Facility may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nPlastics\nInterest expense, net\nPlastics\n \u25e6 Goodwill, and \nGeneral. We have operations in North America, EMEA and Asia. As a result, our business is subject to broad, global and regional macroeconomic factors. These factors include:\nSelling, general and administrative expenses from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 decreased $120.6 million or 36.6% compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to comparing periods that include the Predecessor's operating results for a 252 day period as compared to operating results of 365 days. Selling, general and administrative expenses per day for the period from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 decreased by approximately 8.2% compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily driven by lower employee and consulting costs as a result of execution on key productivity and cost management initiatives.\n \u2022 the general state of the economy, specifically inflationary or deflationary trends, GDP growth rates and commodities/feedstocks price movements; \nObligations under the ABL Facility are secured by a first priority lien on all ABL first lien collateral, including eligible inventory and accounts receivable of the ABL Borrowers, and a second priority lien on all Term Loan first lien collateral (other than a second priority security interest in, and mortgages on, any real property), including outstanding equity interests of the Borrower and certain of the other subsidiaries of Holdings, in each case, subject to certain limitations; provided, that no ABL Facility first lien collateral or Term Loan Facility first lien collateral owned by the Canadian Borrower secure the obligations owing under the U.S. tranche of the ABL Facility.\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2016 (Successor) Compared with Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2015 (Predecessor)\nStrategic Initiatives. We are focused on initiatives to enhance growth and profitability, including:\nWe distribute our broad product portfolio through a supply chain consisting of approximately 170 owned, leased or third party warehouses, rail terminals and tank terminals globally with a private fleet of approximately 1,000 units, primarily in North America. We currently employ approximately 2,520 employees globally. At September 30, 2016, we had approximately 500 sales professionals situated in North America, EMEA and Asia, including technical support, field managers and strategic account managers to assist our customers in the selection and application of commodity and specialty products for their end products and processes.\nUnder the ADA Purchase Agreement, Ashland agreed to retain the Retained Specified Remediation Liabilities. Ashland's obligation for these liabilities is not subject to any claim thresholds or deductibles other than expenses the Predecessor incurs arising out of the Other Retained Remediation Liabilities; if the Predecessor incurs expenses arising out of the Other Retained Remediation Liabilities, Ashland's indemnification obligation is subject to an individual claim threshold of $0.2 million and an aggregate claim deductible of $5.0 million. Ashland's indemnification obligation for the Retained Remediation Liabilities is subject to an aggregate ceiling of $75.0 million. Ashland's indemnification obligations resulting from its breach of any representation, warranty or covenant related to environmental matters (other than for liabilities relating to taxes or the breach of any fundamental representation or warranty) are generally limited by an individual claim threshold of $0.2 million, an aggregate claim deductible of $18.6 million and a ceiling of $93.0 million. Collectively, Ashland's indemnification obligations resulting from or relating to the Retained Remediation Liabilities, retained litigation liabilities, and the breach of Ashland's representations, warranties and covenants contained in the ADA Purchase Agreement (other than for liabilities relating to taxes or the breach of any fundamental representation or warranty) are subject to an aggregate ceiling of $139.5 million, and Ashland's total indemnification obligation under the ADA Purchase Agreement (other than for liabilities relating to taxes or any retained indebtedness) is subject to an aggregate ceiling in the amount of the purchase price for the Distribution Business net assets. Ashland's indemnification obligations under the ADA Purchase Agreement as described above terminated as of March 31, 2016, other than for the Retained Specified Remediation Liabilities and for the Other Retained Remediation liabilities reported to Ashland prior to March 31, 2016. As a result, any environmental remediation liabilities reported to Ashland after March 31, 2016 and not arising out of a Retained Remediation Liability will be liabilities of the Company.\nIncome tax expense\nAt September 30, 2016, we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\n\nOther income\nObligations under the Term Loan Facility are secured by a first priority lien on all Term Loan first lien collateral, including outstanding equity interests of the Borrower and certain of the other subsidiaries of Holdings, and a second priority lien on all ABL first lien collateral, including accounts receivable and inventory of the loan parties under the Term Loan Facility, subject to certain limitations.\nAs of the Closing Date, the Predecessor was in compliance with the covenants of the indenture governing the Notes.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 decreased $6.3 million or 1.9% compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses is approximately $12.7 million, including $3.3 million of depreciation and amortization expense, attributable to the estimated impact of two months of additional operations from the CSD Acquisition and six additional months of operations from the Archway Acquisition during fiscal year 2015. Beginning on July 1, 2015, we fully integrated Archway into our own operations. Excluding the impact of this $12.7 million, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $19.0 million in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to (i) a decrease of $5.6 million in consulting costs, (ii) lower travel costs of $4.1 million, (iii) lower employee costs of $3.3 million, (iv) lower bad debt expense of $2.8 million, primarily related to specific customer write-offs in fiscal year 2014, (v) other costs decrease of $2.4 million, primarily related to telecommunications expense and (vi) lower insurance costs of $1.9 million. Lower expenses were the result of our execution on key productivity and cost management initiatives. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $1.2 million associated with facility, equipment and vehicle investments made in fiscal year 2015, and an unfavorable foreign exchange variance over the prior fiscal year of $1.0 million primarily associated with fluctuations in the RMB exchange rate versus the U.S. dollar.\nIn addition to operating and non-operating cash requirements previously described, our longer-term liquidity needs are primarily related to our final maturity debt payments due in 2021 and 2023. Depending on market conditions and other factors, we may also consider alternative financing options, including, but not limited to, issuance of equity, issuance of new debt or refinancing of our existing debt obligations.\nAt September 30, 2016, we had $47.5 million in cash and cash equivalents of which $41.9 million was held by foreign subsidiaries, $36.9 million of which was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily in euros and RMB. At September 30, 2016, we had $6.5 million in China denominated in RMB. While the RMB is convertible into U.S. dollars, foreign exchange transactions are subject to approvals from the SAFE. We do not anticipate any significant adverse impact to overall liquidity from restrictions on cash and cash equivalents.\nOther\nGross profit declined $88.2 million from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to comparing periods that include the Predecessor's operating results for a 252 day period to operating results of 365 days. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the Chemicals line of business from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 was 12.8% as compared to 11.5% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to the positive impact during the period from October 1, 2015 through June 8, 2016 of (i) our profitability initiatives, (ii) effective management of product costs in the deflationary environment, (iii) improved product mix and, (iv) the continued execution of cost saving efforts including better utilization of our private fleet, better management of certain warehouse costs and other operating improvements.\nIn terms of currency, the euro and the other European currencies weakened versus the U.S. dollar when comparing fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2015, which affected, among other items, the reported dollar revenues and gross profit from our European operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGross profit\n \u2022 complementing organic growth by pursuing attractive merger and acquisition opportunities and delivering value creation by leveraging our centralized platform while achieving increased geographic reach and providing enhanced product/service offerings; \nChemicals. The Chemicals line of business distributes specialty and industrial chemicals, additives and solvents to industrial users via railcars, barges, bulk tanker trucks, and as packaged goods in trucks. While our chemicals products are distributed in more than 50 countries worldwide, we primarily distribute our chemicals products in North America and Asia. In connection with the distribution of chemicals products, we provide value-added services such as custom blending, packaging and re-packaging, private-label manufacturing and product testing in the form of chemical analysis, product performance analysis and product development. While our Chemicals line of business serves multiple end markets, key end markets within the industrial space are household, industrial and institutional, performance coatings (including architectural coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers), lubricants, oil and gas and personal care.\nCertain of our vendor arrangements provide for purchase incentives based on us achieving a specified volume of purchases. We record the volume-based purchase incentives as a reduction of inventory costs (and related cost of sales) based on our purchases to date and our estimates of purchases for the remainder of the calendar year. We receive these incentives in the form of rebates that are payable only when our purchases equal or exceed the relevant calendar year target. The determination of these rebates at an interim date involves management judgment. As a result, our cost of sales may be affected if we earn an incentive toward the end of a year that we had not expected to earn in earlier periods or if we fail to earn an incentive that we had expected to earn and had recorded the incentive based on our prior estimates.\nSales and operating revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 decreased $2,883.4 million or 73.0%. The decrease was primarily attributable to comparing periods that include the acquired business' operating results for a 114 day period as compared to operating results of 365 days. Additionally, declines in revenue were driven by lower sales per shipping day and lower average selling prices in both our Chemicals and Plastics businesses as a result of the decline in oil and other commodity prices during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, as well as, weaker industrial demand.\nOther Long-Lived Assets. Property, plant and equipment and other intangibles with definite lives are tested for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. When an impairment test is performed and the undiscounted expected future cash flow is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. The factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating results, trends and prospects, as well as the effect of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n\nOur diverse array of product offerings allows us to provide many of our customers with a one-stop-shop resource for their chemicals and plastics needs. For customers with multiple locations, our centralized business model helps ensure consistency of product offerings and a single point of contact. Our services and full product offering allow for product customization, cost savings to customers on transaction and transportation costs and reliance on a single supplier to source all of a customer's diverse product requirements.\nIncome tax expense for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 was $1.2 million and is primarily attributable to foreign income tax expense on profitable foreign operations, primarily EMEA and Mexico. Successor and Predecessor income taxes are generally not comparable as the Predecessor was organized as a limited liability company and taxed as a partnership for U.S. income tax purposes. Predecessor income tax expense for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 was $3.9 million and primarily attributable to foreign income tax expense on profitable foreign operations, primarily Canada, Mexico, the U.K., and Spain.\nABL Facility\nIn accounting for business combinations, the purchase price paid to acquire a business is allocated to its assets and liabilities based on the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. These fair values are often estimated through the application of the income approach which requires us to estimate future cash inflows and outflows and apply an appropriate discount rate. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. A significant amount of judgment is involved in estimating the individual fair values of property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. The estimated fair values assigned to the net assets acquired could have a significant effect on our results of operations in the future. The estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, while we use all available information to make these fair value determinations and generally engage third party consultants for assistance, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value. During fiscal year 2016, we completed the Business Combination. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe monitor these factors routinely for both strategic and operational impacts.\nGross profit declined $168.7 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to comparing periods that include the acquired business' operating results for a 114 day period to operating results of 365 days. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the Chemicals line of business for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 was 11.7% as compared to 11.5% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase was attributable to a better pricing discipline and improved delivery costs to service our customers, offset by the recognition of $6.0 million of inventory step up recorded due to the Business Combination, and additional depreciation expense of approximately $1.6 million resulting from the step up in fair value of property, plant and equipment as a result of the Business Combination.\nFees paid to the lenders during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 in connection with the ABL Facility totaled $6.8 million and were recorded as debt issuance costs in Other non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheet to be amortized as interest expense over the remaining term of the ABL Facility.\nResults of Operations\nSales and operating revenues for the Plastics line of business for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 decreased $1,329.4 million or 70.9%. The decrease was primarily attributable to comparing periods that include the acquired business' operating results for a 114 day period as compared to operating results of 365 days. Sales per shipping day decreased 7.2% as average selling prices declined due to lower oil and other commodity prices, as well as, weaker industrial demand.\nGross profit declined $19.4 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to comparing periods that include the acquired business' operating results for a 114 day period to operating results of 365 days. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the Other line of business for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 was 22.2% as compared to 24.4% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to price compression associated with a competitive market.\nConsistent with industry standards, we may offer volume-based rebates to large customers if the customer purchases a specified volume with us over a specified time period. The determination of these rebates at an interim date involves management judgment. As a result, our revenues may be affected if a customer earns a rebate toward the end of a year that we had not expected or if its estimate of customer purchases are less than expected. We have the experience and access to relevant information that we believe is necessary to reasonably estimate the amounts of such deductions from gross revenues. We regularly review the information related to these estimates and adjusts our reserves accordingly if and when actual experience differs from previous estimates. We recognize the rebate obligation as a reduction of revenue based on the estimate of the total volume of purchases from a given customer over the specified period of time.\nNet cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 for the Predecessor, was $50.8 million. The net loss from continuing operations of $12.2 million, adjusted for gains on sale of assets, gain from proceeds of insurance claims, foreign currency gain and significant non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization expenses, debt issuance costs amortization, provision for bad debt, deferred income taxes, equity-based compensation charges and the foreign currency gain on purchase of additional equity interest in Nexeo Plaschem, collectively totaling $60.2 million, provided $48.0 million of cash inflow from continuing operations during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Additionally, cash flows from continuing operations were positively impacted by an increase in accounts payable and other accrued expenses of $44.7 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. However, the Predecessor experienced a negative impact on cash flows from continuing operations during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 resulting from a net increase in accounts and notes receivable of $31.2 million and a net increase in inventories of $9.9 million. The increase in accounts and notes receivable was driven primarily by timing of collections at period end. Additionally, the increase in accounts and notes receivable reflects the impact of activity related to CSD's and Archway's operations. There were no significant changes in billing terms or collection processes during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. The increase in inventories during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 reflected the impact of inventory purchases related to CSD's and Archway's operations.\n \u2022 general income growth and the consumption rates of products; and \nInvesting activities used $270.0 million of cash during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 for the Predecessor, primarily due to the closing of the Archway Acquisition for $128.7 million in April 2014, the closing of the CSD Acquisition for $96.4 million in December 2013 and capital expenditures of $49.9 million throughout the fiscal year, primarily related to additions to the Predecessor's private delivery fleet, facility improvements, and information technology investments.\n \u2022 unemployment levels; \nOther\n \u2022 fiscal and monetary policies of governments, including import and export tariffs, duties and other taxes; \nAt September 30, 2016, we had $117.7 million in borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility. Interest expense related to the ABL Facility, excluding amortization of debt issuance costs, was $1.8 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016.\n \u2022 growing organically by increasing the breadth and depth of our specialty capabilities, expanding our suite of value-added services and driving scale enhancements; \nIn determining the recoverability of deferred tax assets, we give consideration to all available evidence on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis, and then increase or decrease our valuation allowance as appropriate.\nAsia\nSales and operating revenues for the Chemicals line of business for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 decreased $1,478.0 million or 75.6%. The decrease was primarily attributable to comparing periods that include the acquired business' operating results for a 114 day period as compared to operating results of 365 days. Sales per shipping day declined 22.2% as average selling prices declined as a result of lower oil and commodity prices. Additionally, certain suppliers have elected to supply customers directly.\nIncome tax expense\nOur operations in Asia are concentrated mainly in China. Recent GDP growth in China, as reported by the Chinese government, has been slower than their reported GDP growth over the past five years, primarily due to a weaker property sector, lower credit growth and weakened industrial production.\nIn terms of currency, the CAD declined against the U.S. dollar while comparing fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2015, which affected, among other items, the

the MD&A report:\n\n- The report covers financial results for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014. Fiscal year 2016 includes 114 days of operating results for the acquired business after the merger on June 9, 2016. \n\n- Revenue decreased significantly in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to including only 114 days of the acquired business' results in fiscal 2016 vs 365 days in fiscal 2015. Revenue also decreased due to lower sales prices and demand.\n\n- Gross profit also decreased in fiscal 2016 vs fiscal 2015, mainly due to including fewer days of operating results and lower sales prices. \n\n- Selling, general and administrative expenses declined in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, largely due to including fewer days of operating results. Expenses per day decreased as well.\n\n- Net loss from continuing operations was $8.4 million in fiscal 2016 compared to net income of $21.2 million in fiscal 2015. The decrease was primarily due to lower operating results from fewer days included and non-recurring transaction costs.\n\n- Cash flows from operations were $3.2 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $154.7 million in fiscal 2015, mainly due to the reduced operating results.\n\n- Liquidity remained sufficient at fiscal year-end 2016. The company had $321.3 million of total liquidity, including cash on hand and availability under credit facilities. \n\nIn summary, the company's financial performance declined in fiscal 2016 primarily due to lower results from including fewer days after the merger, as well as reduced sales prices and demand. Liquidity remained adequate to meet short-term needs."}
