Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited consolidated interim financial statements, together in each case with the related notes, included elsewhere in this Report. This discussion and analysis contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Report.\nOverview\nWe are a designer and manufacturer of analog and mixed-signal semiconductor platform solutions for communications, IoT, consumer, industrial and automotive applications. We provide technology platforms for analog, mixed-signal, power, high voltage, non-volatile memory, and RF applications. We have a proven record with about 40 years of operating history, a portfolio of approximately 3,000 registered patents and pending applications and extensive engineering and manufacturing process expertise.\nOur Foundry Services Group provides specialty analog and mixed-signal foundry services mainly for fabless and IDM semiconductor companies that primarily serve communications, IoT, consumer, industrial and automotive applications. Our Standard Products Group includes our Display Solutions and Power Solutions business lines. Our Display Solutions products provide flat panel display solutions to major suppliers of large and small rigid and flexible panel displays, and mobile, automotive applications and home appliances. Our Power Solutions products include discrete and integrated circuit solutions for power management in communications, consumer, computing and industrial applications.\nOur wide variety of analog and mixed-signal semiconductor products and manufacturing services combined with our mature technology platform allow us to address multiple high-growth end markets and to rapidly develop and introduce new products and services in response to market demands. Our design center and substantial manufacturing operations in Korea place us at the core of the global electronics device supply chain. We believe this enables us to quickly and efficiently respond to our customers' needs and allows us to better serve and capture additional demand from existing and new customers.\nTo maintain and increase our profitability, we must accurately forecast trends in demand for electronics devices that incorporate semiconductor products we produce. We must understand our customers' needs as well as the likely end market trends and demand in the markets they serve. We must balance the likely manufacturing utilization demand of our product businesses and foundry business to optimize our capacity utilization. We must also invest in relevant research and development activities and manufacturing capacity and purchase necessary materials on a timely basis to meet our customers' demand while maintaining our target margins and cash flow.\nThe semiconductor markets in which we participate are highly competitive. The prices of our products tend to decrease regularly over their useful lives, and such price decreases can be significant as new generations of products are introduced by us or our competitors. We strive to offset the impact of declining selling prices for existing products through cost reductions and the introduction of new products that command selling prices above the average selling price of our existing products. In addition, we seek to manage our inventories and manufacturing capacity so as to mitigate the risk of losses from product obsolescence.\nDemand for our products and services is driven by overall demand for communications, IoT, consumer, industrial and automotive products and can be adversely affected by periods of weak consumer and enterprise spending or by market share losses by our customers. In order to mitigate the impact of market volatility on our business, we are diversifying our portfolio of products, customers, and target applications. We also expect that new competitors will emerge in these markets that may place increased pressure on the pricing for our products and services. While we believe we are well positioned competitively to compete in these markets and against these new competitors as a result of our long operating history, existing manufacturing capacity and our\nworldwide customer base, if we are not effective in competing in these markets our operating results may be adversely affected.\nWithin our Foundry Services Group, net sales are driven by customers' decisions on which manufacturing services provider to use for a particular product. Most of our Foundry Services Group customers are fabless, while some are IDM customers. A customer will often have more than one supplier of manufacturing services. In any given period, our net sales depend heavily upon the end-market demand for the goods in which the products we manufacture for customers are used, the inventory levels maintained by our customers and in some cases, allocation of demand for manufacturing services among selected qualified suppliers.\nWithin our Standard Products Group, net sales are driven by design wins in which we are selected by an electronics original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or other potential customer to supply its demand for a particular product. A customer will often have more than one supplier designed in to multi-source components for a particular product line. Once we have design wins and the products enter into mass production, we often specify the pricing of a particular product for a set period of time, with periodic discussions and renegotiations of pricing with our customers. In any given period, our net sales depend heavily upon the end-market demand for the goods in which our products are used, the inventory levels maintained by our customers and in some cases, allocation of demand for components for a particular product among selected qualified suppliers.\nIn contrast to completely fabless semiconductor companies, our internal manufacturing capacity provides us with greater control over manufacturing costs and the ability to implement process and production improvements for our internally manufactured products, which can favorably impact gross profit margins. Our internal manufacturing capacity also allows for better control over delivery schedules, improved consistency over product quality and reliability and improved ability to protect intellectual property from misappropriation on these products. However, having internal manufacturing capacity exposes us to the risk of under-utilization of manufacturing capacity that results in lower gross profit margins, particularly during downturns in the semiconductor industry.\nOur products and services require investments in capital equipment. Analog and mixed-signal manufacturing facilities and processes are typically distinguished by the design and process implementation expertise rather than the use of the most advanced equipment. Many of these processes also tend to migrate more slowly to smaller geometries due to technological barriers and increased costs. For example, some of our products use high-voltage technology that requires larger geometries and that may not migrate to smaller geometries for several years, if at all. As a result, our manufacturing base and strategy do not require substantial investment in leading edge process equipment for those products, allowing us to utilize our facilities and equipment over an extended period of time with moderate required capital investments. In addition, we are less likely to experience significant industry overcapacity, which can cause product prices to decline significantly. In general, we seek to invest in manufacturing capacity that can be used for multiple high-value applications over an extended period of time. In addition, we outsource manufacturing of those products which do require advanced technology and 12-inch wafer capacity. We believe this capital investment strategy enables us to optimize our capital investments and facilitates more diversified product and service offerings.\nSince 2007, we have designed and manufactured organic light emitting diodes (OLED) display driver ICs in our internal manufacturing facilities. As we expanded our design capabilities to products that require lower geometries unavailable at our existing manufacturing facilities, we began outsourcing manufacturing of certain OLED display driver ICs to an external foundry from the second half of 2015. This additional source of manufacturing is an increasingly important part of our supply chain management. By outsourcing manufacturing of advanced OLED products to external foundries, we are able to dynamically adapt to the changing customer requirements and address growing markets without substantial capital investments by us. Both at the internal manufacturing facilities and external foundries, we apply our unique OLED process patents as well as other intellectual property, proprietary process design kits and custom design-flow methodologies.\nIn our previous public filings, we had used a term \u201cactive matrix organic light emitting diodes (AMOLED)\u201d that described a display technology used in certain display driver ICs that we had designed and manufactured in our internal and external foundries. Beginning in the second quarter of 2017, we have used the term \u201cOLED\u201d instead of the term \u201cAMOLED\u201d in our public filings in order to be consistent with commonly accepted industry naming practices for this product category. There is no change to the products that we previously referred to as AMOLED display driver ICs.\nOur success going forward will depend upon our ability to adapt to future challenges such as the emergence of new competitors for our products and services or the consolidation of current competitors. Additionally, we must innovate to remain ahead of, or at least rapidly adapt to, technological breakthroughs that may lead to a significant change in the technology necessary to deliver our products and services. We believe that our established relationships and close collaboration with leading customers enhance our awareness of new product opportunities, market and technology trends and improve our ability to adapt and grow successfully. In our Foundry Services Group, we strive to maintain competitiveness by offering high-value added processes, high-flexibility and excellent service by tailoring existing standard processes to meet customers' design needs and porting customers' own process technologies into our fabrication facilities.\nWe are in a period of weaker demand from our foundry customers in part as a result of recent softening global market conditions, including macroeconomic uncertainties. This, together with significantly lower than expected utilization, among other factors will adversely impact our Foundry Services Group gross margin and other operating results, and such impact likely will be material. We are also currently evaluating a number of options to optimize our foundry operations and expense structure with an intent toward maximizing shareholder value.\nOn February 14, 2019, we announced that we have undertaken a strategic evaluation of our Foundry Services Group business and fabrication facility located in Cheongju (\u201cFab 4\u201d), the larger of our two 8\u201d manufacturing facilities. Fab 4 is an analog and mixed signal fab that produces approximately 73% of our total capacity, and is used primarily to meet wafer demand from customers of our Foundry Services Group that rely on outside suppliers. The strategic evaluation is expected to include a range of possible options, including, but not limited to, joint ventures, strategic partnerships as well as M&A possibilities. We have engaged J.P. Morgan Securities LLC as our financial advisor to assist in the evaluation. It is possible that the announced strategic evaluation of our Foundry Services Group business and Fab 4 could adversely impact foundry loadings and Company margins.\nRecent Developments\nRepurchase of Long-term Borrowings\nIn December 2018, we repurchased a principal amount of $0.5 million and $1.6 million of the 2021 Notes and the Exchangeable Notes, respectively. As a result, we recorded a $0.2 million net loss as early extinguishment loss on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWater Treatment Facility Arrangement\nOn June 29, 2018, we entered into an arrangement whereby we acquired a water treatment facility to support our fabrication facility in Gumi, Korea from SK hynix for $4.2 million, and sold it for $4.2 million to a third party management company that we have engaged to run the facility for a 10-year term. This arrangement is accounted for as a financing due to our Korean subsidiary's continuing involvement with the facility. As a result, on the acquisition date, we recorded the water treatment facility of $4.2 million as property, plant and equipment, net, which is depreciated over its useful life. We also recorded the related liabilities of $0.6 million as other current liabilities and $3.6 million as other non-current liabilities, which relates to the financing and service portion of the arrangement and is amortized using the effective interest method over the contract period.\nSegment Change\nIn January 2018, as part of our ongoing portfolio optimization effort to realign business processes and streamline our organizational structure, we transferred a portion of our non-OLED display solutions business\nfrom our Standards Products Group to our Foundry Services Group. The transferred non-OLED display business has technical and business characteristics more closely aligned with our Foundry Services business than with our Standard Products business, which resided within our Display solutions business line primarily as a result of a long standing customer relationship established in the past. The transferred non-OLED display business represented $33.0 million of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018. The corresponding non-OLED display business represented $30.3 million and $25.2 million of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nTax Audit\nIn September 2017, MagnaChip Semiconductor Ltd. (\u201cMSK\u201d), our Korean operating subsidiary, was notified that the Korean National Tax Service (the \u201cKNTS\u201d) would be examining the income- and non-income-based taxes of MSK for its 2012 to 2014 tax years. The KNTS had conducted its audit, primarily focusing on non-income-based value added tax (\u201cVAT\u201d) transactions associated with the periods with respect to which we previously restated our financial statements as a result of the independent investigation commenced by our Audit Committee in January 2014 (the \u201cRestatement\u201d).\nAs a result, the aggregate tax and penalty assessment by the KNTS was $6.0 million, of which $3.3 million had already been accrued by us in our financial statements in connection with the Restatement filed in 2015. Such amount also included approximately $0.5 million related to employee withholding amounts and associated penalties, and to the extent any such tax obligation was that of MSK's employees. In addition, KNTS assessed an administrative fine of $2.0 million in connection with the above-described tax audit.\nIn December 2017, the KNTS concluded that no criminal charges would be brought against any current officers or directors of MSK or MSK itself. As a result, we took a charge of $4.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to this additional tax assessment and associated penalties and administrative fine. We recorded the $0.5 million related to employee withholding amounts as other receivables in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017, as we expected to obtain reimbursement of the applicable amounts from those employees. Of the $0.5 million, we have collected $0.1 million and established an allowance of $0.4 million and recorded it as selling, general and administrative expense for the three months ended September 30, 2018.\nSecondary offering\nOn August 15, 2017, certain of our stockholders that are affiliates of Avenue Capital Management II, L.P. (the \u201cSelling Stockholders\u201d) closed an underwritten registered public offering of 4,088,978 shares of our common stock at a price per share of $11.10. We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of our common stock by the Selling Stockholders, but paid certain expenses in connection with such secondary offering pursuant to an existing contractual arrangement with the Selling Stockholders.\nEvents associated with the closure of our 6-inch fab and reduction of workforce\nIn December 2014, we announced that our Board of Directors had adopted a plan to close our 6-inch fab. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we received an $8.2 million deposit for sale of machinery in conjunction with the planned closure of our 6-inch fab. According to this plan, the 6-inch fab was closed on February 29, 2016. During the first quarter of 2016, we completed all procedures necessary to sell all machineries in our closed 6-inch fab and recognized a $7.8 million restructuring gain from the related deposit of $8.2 million, net of certain direct selling costs. On April 4, 2016, we commenced a voluntary resignation program (the \u201cProgram\u201d), which was available to certain manufacturing employees, including our 6-inch fab employees, through April 29, 2016.\nAs of April 29, 2016, 169 employees elected to resign under the terms of the Program. We paid approximately $8 million for severance benefits, which are required by law and had already been fully accrued in our financial statements, in a lump sum during the second quarter of 2016. Beginning in May 2016, we also\nbegan to pay a portion of the $4.2 million other termination benefits under the Program, which were paid in equal monthly installments over twelve months. We recorded the $4.2 million charge related to the full amount of these other termination benefits payable under the Program during the second quarter of 2016.\nAs of December 21, 2016, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell a building located in Cheongju, South Korea. The building has historically been used to house the 6-inch fab and became vacant upon the closure of the fabrication facility. As of December 31, 2015, the building was fully impaired. We received proceeds of $18.2 million, including a $1.7 million value-added tax, for the sale of the building on December 26, 2016. We recorded the $18.2 million as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2016 as we were obligated to perform certain removal construction work that was expected to be completed by the end of March 2017. During the first quarter of 2017, we completed all removal construction work necessary to transfer the title of the building, and the $18.2 million of restricted cash was fully released.\nAs of February 22, 2017, our Board of Directors approved the implementation of a headcount reduction plan (the \u201cHeadcount Reduction Plan\u201d). As of June 30, 2017, 352 employees elected to resign from the Company during the period in which the Headcount Reduction Plan was offered. The Headcount Reduction Plan is expected to result in estimated annual cost savings of approximately $24 million. The total cash cost of approximately $31 million has been fully paid. We recorded in our consolidated statement of operations $11.1 million and $2.3 million termination related charges as \u201cearly termination charges\u201d for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, respectively. The remaining total cost relates to statutory severance benefits, which are required by law and had already been fully accrued in our financial statements.\nIssuance of Exchangeable Senior Notes and Stock Repurchase\nAs of January 17, 2017, we closed the offering (the \u201cExchangeable Notes Offering\u201d) by our Luxembourg subsidiary, MagnaChip Semiconductor S.A., of $86.25 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.00% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2021 (the \u201cExchangeable Notes\u201d), reflecting the full exercise of the initial purchasers' option to purchase additional Exchangeable Notes. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the Exchangeable Notes Offering to repurchase 1,795,444 shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program, which was authorized by our board of directors on January 10, 2017, at an aggregate cost of $11.4 million.\nSale of Sensor Business\nIn March 2017, we sold our sensor product business, which was included in and reported as part of the Display Solutions line of our Standard Products Group, to a third party for proceeds of $1.3 million, in an effort to improving our overall profitability. We recorded a $0.4 million gain from this sale after deducting the book values of certain assets transferred to the buyer.\nRestatement\nIn January 2014, our Audit Committee commenced an independent investigation that resulted in the Restatement. In March, 2014, we voluntarily reported to the SEC that our Audit Committee had determined that we incorrectly recognized revenue on certain transactions and as a result would restate our financial statements, and that our Audit Committee had commenced an independent investigation.\nOn December 10, 2015, we entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with the plaintiffs' representatives to settle the Class Action Litigation, as defined and detailed in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in this Report, for an aggregate settlement payment of $23.5 million. This settlement payment was fully funded by insurance proceeds that were received in the first quarter of 2016 and disbursed from the escrow account, previously recorded as restricted cash, in the third quarter of 2016.\nOn January 22, 2016, we entered into a stipulation of settlement with the plaintiffs in the shareholder derivative actions, as described in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in this Report, for an aggregate payment of $3.0 million from our insurance proceeds that were received in the first quarter of 2016 and recorded in the escrow account. In October 2016, the court approved the settlement of the shareholder derivative actions for $3.0 million, which included $0.75 million awarded to plaintiffs' counsel. Upon the expiration of the appeals period, $2.25 million was disbursed from the escrow account, previously recorded as restricted cash, in December 2016. The remaining restricted cash related to insurance proceeds of $3.1 million was also released in December 2016.\nOn May 1, 2017, the SEC announced that it had reached a final settlement with us, resolving the SEC's investigation, as detailed in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in this Report. In connection therewith, we have consented, without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, to the entry of an administrative order by the SEC directing that we cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of certain provisions of the federal securities laws and related SEC regulations. The SEC's administrative order was entered on May 1, 2017. The SEC imposed a monetary penalty of $3.0 million on us. In the three months ended March 31, 2017, we established a reserve in that amount for the potential settlement of this matter and recorded it as selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The reserved monetary penalty of $3.0 million was paid to the SEC during the three months ended June 30, 2017.\nAs a result of the Restatement, we incurred substantial external accounting, legal and other related costs associated with the Restatement and certain litigation and other regulatory investigations and actions related thereto. We recorded Restatement related costs of $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which included tax assessment, and associated penalties of $4.3 million, primarily related to non-income-based VAT transactions in the Restatement periods, compared to $7.0 million of Restatement related costs for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the three months March 31, 2018, the reversal of a $0.8 million accrual related to certain legal fees, incurred in prior periods and reimbursed by insurers in the current quarter, was recorded as a Restatement related gain.\nSegments\nWe report our financial results in two operating segments: Foundry Services Group and Standard Products Group. We identified these segments based on how we allocate resources and assess our performance.\nIn January 2018, as part of our ongoing portfolio optimization effort to realign business processes and streamline our organizational structure, we transferred a portion of our non-OLED display solutions business from our Standards Products Group to our Foundry Services Group. The transferred non-OLED display business has technical and business characteristics more closely aligned with our Foundry Services business than with our Standard Products business, which resided within our Display solutions business line primarily as a result of a long standing customer relationship established many years ago. We recast comparative segment financial information to conform to this current period change.\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Foundry Services Group: Our Foundry Services Group provides specialty analog and mixed-signal foundry services to fabless semiconductor companies and IDMs that serve communications, IoT, consumer, industrial and automotive applications.

In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure defined in accordance with US GAAP and should not be construed as an alternative to income from continuing operations, cash flows from operating activities or net income, as determined in accordance with US GAAP. A reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In millions) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income (Loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3.9 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>84.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(29.6 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EBITDA\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>134.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring and other gain, net(a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17.0 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.5 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Early termination charges(b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity-based compensation expense(c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign currency loss (gain), net(d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(65.5 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Derivative valuation loss (gain), net(e)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.2 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restatement related expenses (gain)(f)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.8 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Secondary offering expenses(g)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on early extinguishment of long-term borrowings, net(h)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other indemnification costs and reimbursement(i)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>84.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>78.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td>(a) </td> <td> For the year ended December 31, 2017, this adjustment eliminates the $16.6 million restructuring gain on sale of a building in connection with the closure of our 6-inch fab and the $0.4 million gain on sale of our sensor business.

Our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $78.7 million and $28.9 million, respectively. Our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $40.7 million and $4.5 million, respectively.\nFactors Affecting Our Results of Operations\nNet Sales. We derive virtually all of our sales (net of sales returns and allowances) from two segments: Foundry Services Group and Standard Products Group. Our product inventory is primarily located in Korea and is available for drop shipment globally. Outside of Korea, we maintain limited product inventory, and our sales representatives generally relay orders to our factories in Korea for fulfillment. We have strategically located our sales and technical support offices near concentrations of major customers. Our sales offices are located in Korea, the United States, Japan and Greater China. Our network of authorized agents and distributors is in the United States, Europe and the Asia Pacific region. Our net sales from All other consist principally of the disposal of scrap materials.\nPrior to the adoption of the new revenue standard effective on January 1, 2018, we had historically recognized revenue when risk and reward of ownership pass to the customer either upon shipment, upon product delivery at the customer's location or upon customer acceptance, depending on the terms of the arrangement. After the adoption of the new revenue standard effective on January 1, 2018, we recognize revenue over time for those foundry products without alternative use where we have an enforceable right to payment for the related foundry services completed to date. As we adopted the new revenue standard under the modified retrospective method, we have not changed the comparative information in our interim consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. Such comparative information continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for that period. See \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 1-Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies-Basis of Presentation and Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in this Report for further discussion. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we sold products to 370 and 343 customers, respectively, and our net sales to our ten largest customers represented 61% and 57% of our net sales, respectively. We have a combined production capacity of approximately 113,000 semiconductor wafers per month. We believe our large-scale, cost-effective fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly adjust our production levels to meet shifts in demand by our end customers.\nGross Profit. Our overall gross profit generally fluctuates as a result of changes in overall sales volumes and in the average selling prices of our products and services. Other factors that influence our gross profit include changes in product mix, the introduction of new products and services and subsequent generations of existing products and services, shifts in the utilization of our manufacturing facilities and the yields achieved by our manufacturing operations, changes in material, labor and other manufacturing costs including outsourced manufacturing expenses, and variation in depreciation expense.\nAverage Selling Prices. Average selling prices for our products tend to be highest at the time of introduction of new products which utilize the latest technology and tend to decrease over time as such products mature in the market and are replaced by next generation products. We strive to offset the impact of declining selling prices for existing products through our product development activities and by introducing new products that command selling prices above the average selling price of our existing products. In addition, we seek to manage our inventories and manufacturing capacity so as to preclude losses from product and productive capacity obsolescence.\nMaterial Costs. Our cost of material consists of costs of raw materials, such as silicon wafers, chemicals, gases and tape and packaging supplies. We use processes that require specialized raw materials, such as silicon wafers, that are generally available from a limited number of suppliers. If demand increases or supplies decrease, the costs of our raw materials could increase significantly.\nLabor Costs. A significant portion of our employees are located in Korea. Under Korean labor laws, most employees and certain executive officers with one or more years of service are entitled to severance benefits upon the termination of their employment based on their length of service and rate of pay. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 98% of our employees were eligible for severance benefits.\nDepreciation Expense. We periodically evaluate the carrying values of long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, as well as the related depreciation periods. We depreciated our property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of our assets. Depreciation rates vary from 30-40 years on buildings to 5 to 12 years for certain equipment and assets. Our evaluation of carrying values is based on various analyses including cash flow and profitability projections. If our projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying values of the related long-lived assets, the carrying value of the assets is impaired and will be reduced, with the reduction charged to expense so that the carrying value is equal to fair value.\nSelling Expenses. We sell our products worldwide through a direct sales force as well as a network of sales agents and representatives to OEMs, including major branded customers and contract manufacturers, and\nindirectly through distributors. Selling expenses consist primarily of the personnel costs for the members of our direct sales force, a network of sales representatives and other costs of distribution. Personnel costs include base salary, benefits and incentive compensation.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses consist of the costs of various corporate operations, including finance, legal, human resources and other administrative functions. These expenses primarily consist of payroll-related expenses, consulting and other professional fees and office facility-related expenses.\nResearch and Development. The rapid technological change and product obsolescence that characterize our industry require us to make continuous investments in research and development. Product development time frames vary but, in general, we incur research and development costs one to two years before generating sales from the associated new products. These expenses include personnel costs for members of our engineering workforce, cost of photomasks, silicon wafers and other non-recurring engineering charges related to product design. Additionally, we develop base line process technology through experimentation and through the design and use of characterization wafers that help achieve commercially feasible yields for new products. The majority of research and development expenses of our Foundry Services Group are for process development that serves as a common technology platform for all of our product lines. For our Standard Products Group, the majority of research and development expenses are material-related costs for OLED display driver IC product development involving fine processes.\nInterest Expense. Our interest expense was incurred primarily under our 2021 Notes and our Exchangeable Notes.\nImpact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates on Reported Results of Operations. Historically, a portion of our revenues and greater than the majority of our operating expenses and costs of sales have been denominated in non-US currencies, principally the Korean won, and we expect that this will remain true in the future. Because we report our results of operations in US dollars converted from our non-US revenues and expenses based on monthly average exchange rates, changes in the exchange rate between the Korean won and the US dollar could materially impact our reported results of operations and distort period to period comparisons. In particular, because of the difference in the amount of our consolidated revenues and expenses that are in US dollars relative to Korean won, depreciation in the US dollar relative to the Korean won could result in a material increase in reported costs relative to revenues, and therefore could cause our profit margins and operating income (loss) to appear to decline materially, particularly relative to prior periods. The converse is true if the US dollar were to appreciate relative to the Korean won. Moreover, our foreign currency gain or loss would be affected by changes in the exchange rate between the Korean won and the US dollar as a substantial portion of non-cash translation gain or loss is associated with the intercompany long-term loans to our Korean subsidiary, which is denominated in US dollars. As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding intercompany loan balance including accrued interest between our Korean subsidiary and our Dutch subsidiary was $666.6 million. This amount included an intercompany loan of $75.0 million executed during the three months ended March 31, 2017, which was used to transfer a portion of the net proceeds from the offering of the Exchangeable Notes from our Luxembourg subsidiary to our Dutch subsidiary, and then to our Korean subsidiary. As a result of such foreign currency fluctuations, it could be more difficult to detect underlying trends in our business and results of operations. In addition, to the extent that fluctuations in currency exchange rates cause our results of operations to differ from our expectations or the expectations of our investors, the trading price of our stock could be adversely affected.\nFrom time to time, we may engage in exchange rate hedging activities in an effort to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. Our Korean subsidiary enters into foreign currency forward and zero cost collar contracts in order to mitigate a portion of the impact of US dollar-Korean won exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results. Obligations under these foreign currency forward and zero cost collar contracts must be cash collateralized if our exposure exceeds certain specified thresholds. These forward and zero cost collar contracts may be terminated by the counterparty in a number of circumstances, including if our total cash and cash\nequivalents is less than $30.0 million at the end of a fiscal quarter unless a waiver is obtained from the counterparty. We cannot assure that any hedging technique we implement will be effective. If our hedging activities are not effective, changes in currency exchange rates may have a more significant impact on our results of operations.\nForeign Currency Gain or Loss. Foreign currency translation gains or losses on transactions by us or our subsidiaries in a currency other than our or our subsidiaries' functional currency are included in our statements of operations as a component of other income (expense). A substantial portion of this net foreign currency gain or loss relates to non-cash translation gain or loss related to the principal balance of intercompany balances at our Korean subsidiary that are denominated in US dollars. This gain or loss results from fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Korean won and US dollar.\nIncome Taxes. We record our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves using an asset and liability approach whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for differences in the financial reporting bases and tax bases of our assets and liabilities. We exercise significant management judgment in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities. We assess whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets existing at the period-end will be realized in future periods. In such assessment, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent results of operations. In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize the deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would adjust the valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.\nWe are subject to income- or non-income-based tax examinations by tax authorities of the US, Korea and multiple other foreign jurisdictions, where applicable, for all open tax years. Significant estimates and judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income- or non-income based taxes. Some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations. The ultimate amount of tax liability may be uncertain as a result. See \u201cItem 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 16. Income Taxes\u201d included elsewhere in this Report.\nCapital Expenditures. We primarily invest in manufacturing equipment, software design tools and other tangible assets mainly for fabrication facility maintenance, capacity expansion and technology improvement. Capacity expansions and technology improvements typically occur in anticipation of increases in demand. We typically pay for capital expenditures in partial installments with portions due on order, delivery and final acceptance. Our capital expenditures mainly include our payments for the purchase of property, plant and equipment.\nInventories. We monitor our inventory levels in light of product development changes and market expectations. We may be required to take additional charges for quantities in excess of demand, cost in excess of market value and product age. Our analysis may take into consideration historical usage, expected demand, anticipated sales price, new product development schedules, the effect new products might have on the sales of existing products, product age, customer design activity, customer concentration and other factors. These forecasts require us to estimate our ability to predict demand for current and future products and compare those estimates with our current inventory levels and inventory purchase commitments. Our forecasts for our inventory may differ from actual inventory use.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain information related to our operations,

31, 2018, a $71.2 million, or 10.5%, increase compared to $679.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue from our Standard Products Group, which was offset in part by a decrease in revenue from our Foundry Services Group.\nFoundry Services Group. Net sales from our Foundry Services Group segment were $325.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a $25.1 million, or 7.2%, decrease compared to net sales of $350.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in demand of low margin product sales from a global power management IC foundry customer and a decrease in demand from a customer serving the low- to mid-range mobile phone market. This decrease was offset in part by an increase in sales of certain battery charger related products from a global power management IC foundry customer.\nStandard Products Group. Net sales from our Standard Products Group segment were $425.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a $96.3 million, or 29.3%, increase compared to $329.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue related to an improvement in mobile OLED display driver ICs due to the introduction of new OLED smartphones by Chinese manufacturers and higher demand for premium power products such as high-end MOSFETs and IGBTs primarily for TV and industrial applications. This increase was offset in part by a strategic reduction of our lower margin LCD business.\nAll Other. All other net sales remained constant at $0.2 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nGross Profit\nTotal gross profit was $198.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $187.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a $10.2 million, or 5.4%, increase. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased to 26.4% compared to 27.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to a decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales from our Foundry Services Group, which was offset in part by an increase in gross profits as a percentage of net sales from our Standard Products Group.\nFoundry Services Group. Gross profit from our Foundry Services Group segment was $82.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a $19.2 million, or 18.9%, decrease compared to $101.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased to 25.4% compared to 29.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was mainly attributable to a lower utilization rate, which was affected in part by a softening global market conditions, including macroeconomic uncertainties, and a strategic reduction of low margin LCD business. This decrease was also attributable to an unfavorable product mix and an increase in raw wafer prices.\nStandard Products Group. Gross profit from our Standard Products Group segment was $115.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a $29.6 million, or 34.4%, increase from $85.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased to 27.1% compared to 26.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in both gross profit and gross profit margin was primarily attributable to a favorable product mix from an increase in sales of mobile OLED display driver ICs.\nAll Other. All other gross profit was $0.04 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet Sales by Geographic Region\nWe report net sales by geographic region based on the location to which the products are billed.

This increase was in part offset by a decrease in sales of certain products from a foundry customer serving the low- to mid-range mobile phone market, and a decrease in sales of certain low margin products from a global power management IC foundry customer.\nNet sales in the United States for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased from $35.1 million to $37.5 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, or by $2.4 million, or 6.8%, primarily due to an increase in sales of certain products from a global power management IC foundry customer.\nNet sales in Europe for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased from $41.1 million to $47.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, or by $6.7 million, or 16.4%, primarily due to an increase in sales of certain battery charger related products from a global power management IC foundry customer, which was offset in part by lower demand from a customer serving the high-end smartphone market.\nOperating Expenses\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $72.6 million, or 9.7% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $81.8 million, or 12.0%\nof net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease of $9.1 million, or 11.2%, was primarily attributable to a $6.7 million decrease in professional fees, which were mainly comprised of legal and consulting services and a $4.2 million charge related to an additional tax assessment and associated penalties and an administrative fine as a result of the tax audit conducted by the KNTS which concluded in the fourth quarter of 2017. These decreases were offset in part by an increase in employee compensation, including issuance of equity-based compensation.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses were $78.0 million, or 10.4%, of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $70.5 million, or 10.4%, of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase of $7.5 million, or 10.7%, was primarily attributable to an increase in development activities for new OLED products.\nRestructuring and Other Gain. Restructuring and other gain of $17.0 million recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from a $16.6 million restructuring gain on the sale of the building related to the closure of our 6-inch fab and a $0.4 million gain on sale of our sensor business.\nEarly Termination Charges. Early termination charges of $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 were recorded for the termination benefits payable to the employees affected under our Headcount Reduction Plan.\nOperating Income\nAs a result of the foregoing, operating income increased by an $8.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. As discussed above, the increase in operating income resulted from a $10.2 million increase in gross profit, a $9.1 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses and a $13.4 million decrease in early termination charges, which were partially offset by a $17.0 million decrease in restructuring and other gain and a $7.5 million increase in research development expenses.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest Expense. Interest expenses were $22.3 million and $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nForeign Currency Gain (Loss), Net. Net foreign currency loss for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $24.4 million compared to net foreign currency gain of $65.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net foreign currency loss for the year ended December 31, 2018 was due to the depreciation in value of the Korean won relative to the US dollar during the period. The net foreign currency gain for the year ended December 31, 2017 was due to the appreciation in value of the Korean won relative to the US dollar during the period.\nA substantial portion of our net foreign currency gain or loss is non-cash translation gain or loss associated with the intercompany long-term loans to our Korean subsidiary, which is denominated in US dollars, and is affected by changes in the exchange rate between the Korean won and the US dollar. As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding intercompany loan balance including accrued interest between our Korean subsidiary and our Dutch subsidiary was $666.6 million. Foreign currency translation gain or loss from intercompany balances was included in determining our consolidated net income since the intercompany balances were not considered long-term investments in nature because management intended to settle these intercompany balances at their respective maturity dates.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Long-Term Borrowings, Net. In December 2018, we repurchased a principal amount of $0.5 million and $1.6 million of the 2021 Notes and the Exchangeable Notes, respectively. In connection with these repurchases, we recognized a $0.2 million of net loss for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOthers, Net. Others were comprised of gains and losses on the valuation of derivatives which were designated as hedging instruments, rental income and interest income. Others for the year ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were $0.3 million and $2.9 million, respectively.\nIncome Tax Expenses\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions and our effective tax rate is affected by changes in the mix of earnings between countries with differing tax rates. Our primary foreign operations are in Korea where the statutory tax rate applicable to us was approximately 24.2% in each of 2018 and 2017. Statutory tax rates for our foreign subsidiaries except those in Luxembourg, Netherlands and Korea, were less than the US federal statutory rate of 21.0%.\nWe recorded income tax expenses of $4.6 million and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in income tax expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to taxable income generated by our Korean subsidiary combined with its ability to utilize net operating carryforwards up to 70% of the taxable income, and a decrease in our uncertain tax positions that resulted in a reduction of income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our effective tax rate was 620.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to 1.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nWe make an ongoing assessment regarding the realization of US and non-US deferred tax assets. The valuation allowances at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were primarily attributable to deferred tax assets for the uncertainty in taxable income at our Korean subsidiary for which we have recorded a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets, net of its deferred tax liabilities, and against certain of our foreign subsidiaries' deferred tax assets pertaining to their related tax loss carry-forwards and tax credits that are not anticipated to generate a tax benefit.\nNet Income\nAs a result of the foregoing, net income decreased by $88.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. As discussed above, the decrease primarily resulted from a $90.0 million increase in foreign currency loss and a $3.5 million increase in income tax expenses, which was partially offset by an $8.2 million increase in operating income.\nResults of Operations-Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nThe following table sets forth consolidated results of operations for the years ended

December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily attributable to a net decrease in revenue from our Standard Products Group, which was offset in part by an increase in revenue from our Foundry Services Group as described below.\nFoundry Services Group. Net sales from our Foundry Services Group segment were $350.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a $51.3 million, or 17.1%, increase compared to net sales of $299.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to higher demand for our foundry services from certain customers serving the mid-range smartphone and consumer electronics markets and higher sales of certain products from a global power management IC foundry customer. These increases were partially offset by a net decrease in demand of our foundry services from a customer serving the high-end smartphone market.\nStandard Products Group. Net sales from our Standard Products Group segment were $329.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a $59.2 million, or 15.2%, decrease compared to $388.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This substantial decrease was primarily due to a significant decrease in revenue related to our Display Solutions business line, partially offset by increase in revenue related to our Power Solutions business line as described below.\nNet sales from our Display Solutions business line were $179.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a $77.6 million, or 30.2%, decrease from $256.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenue from our mobile OLED display driver ICs stemming from a timing mismatch between the drop-off in revenue from our existing OLED products and the introduction of new OLED products, and also from a prolonged slowdown in the China smartphone market. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenue from large display products mainly due to higher demand of source drivers for ultra high definition TVs. Net sales from our Power Solutions business line were $149.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a $18.4 million, or 14.0%, increase from $131.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in sales was primarily due to premium power products and MOSFETs for TV and mobile battery applications.\nAll Other. All other net sales were $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively.\nGross Profit\nTotal gross profit was $187.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $156.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a $31.7 million, or 20.3%, increase. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased to 27.6% compared to 22.7% for the year ended December 31,\n2016. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was due to both our Foundry Services Group and Standard Products Group segments as described below.\nFoundry Services Group. Gross profit from our Foundry Services Group segment was $101.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a $28.7 million, or 39.3%, increase compared to $73.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased to 29.0% compared to 24.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was mainly attributable to a better product mix, a higher utilization rate and a favorable impact from reduction in headcount, which was offset in part primarily by an increase in wafer price and employee costs associated with unused vacation.\nStandard Products Group. Gross profit from our Standard Products Group segment was $85.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a $2.4 million, or 2.8%, increase from $83.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased to 26.1% compared to 21.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was mainly attributable to a higher utilization rate and a favorable impact from reduction in headcount, which was offset in part primarily by an increase in wafer price and employee costs associated with unused vacation.\nAll Other. All other gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $0.2 million. All other gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 was a negative $0.4 million mainly attributable to training and transition costs related to our closed 6-inch fab employees, which was partially offset by revenue from the disposal of waste materials.\nNet Sales by Geographic Region\nWe report net sales by geographic region based on the location to which the products are billed. The following table sets forth our net sales by geographic region and the percentage of total net sales represented by each geographic region for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nNet Sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nNet Sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change\nAmount </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In millions) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Korea\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>279.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>219.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asia Pacific (other than Korea)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>322.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>391.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(69.3 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S.A.\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Europe\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.2 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Others\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.0 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>679.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>688.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(8.3 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Net sales in Korea for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased from $219.6 million to $279.9 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, or by $60.3 million, or 27.4%, primarily due to higher demand of large display applications for TVs and our foundry services from certain customers serving the mid-range smartphone and consumer electronics markets. Higher sales of premium power products and MOSFETs also had a favorable impact.\nNet sales in Asia Pacific for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased from $391.9 million to $322.6 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, or by $69.3 million, or 17.7%, primarily due to lower level of sales of OLED display driver ICs, which was partially offset by an increase in sales of certain products from higher demand for our foundry services.\nOperating Expenses\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $81.8 million, or 12.0% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $83.5 million, or 12.1% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease of $1.8 million, or 2.1%, was attributable to a $2.9 million decrease in salary expense as a result of our headcount reduction and a $6.6 million decrease in professional fees mainly comprised of legal and consulting services. These decreases were offset in part primarily by a $4.2 million charge of the additional tax assessment and associated penalties and administrative fine as a result of the tax audit conducted by the KNTS which concluded in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses were $70.5 million, or 10.4% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $72.2 million, or 10.5% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease of $1.7 million, or 2.3%, was primarily attributable to a decrease in salary expense as a result of our headcount reduction of non-key R&D personnel.\nRestructuring and Other Charges(Gain), Net. Restructuring and other charges (gain), net of $17.0 million recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from a $16.6 million restructuring gain on the sale of the building related to the closure of our 6-inch fab and a $0.4 million gain on sale of our sensor business. Restructuring and other charges (gain), net of $6.5 million recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted from the sale of machinery related to the closure of our 6-inch fab, which was offset by $1.3 million of training and transition costs related to the employees at our closed 6-inch fab.\nEarly Termination Charges. Termination related charges related to the reduction of workforce through the Headcount Reduction Plan for the year ended December 31, 2017 and the Program for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $13.4 million and $4.2 million, respectively.\nOperating Income (Loss)\nAs a result of the foregoing, operating income increased by $36.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. As discussed above, the increase in operating income resulted from a $31.7 million increase in gross profit, a $1.8 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses, a $1.7 million decrease in research and development expenses and a $10.5 million increase in restructuring gain, which was partially offset by a $9.1 million increase in termination related charges.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest Expense. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $21.6 million compared to interest expense of $16.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase of $5.3 million was attributable to the interest expense recorded for the Exchangeable Notes issued in January 2017.\nForeign Currency Gain (Loss), Net. Net foreign currency gain for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $65.5 million compared to net foreign currency loss of $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The net foreign currency gain for the year ended December 31, 2017 was due to the appreciation in value of the Korean won relative to the US dollar during the period. The net foreign currency loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 was due to the depreciation in value of the Korean won relative to the US dollar during the period.\nA substantial portion of our net foreign currency gain or loss is non-cash translation gain or loss associated with the intercompany long-term loans to our Korean subsidiary, which is denominated in US dollars, and is affected by changes in the exchange rate between the Korean won and the US dollar. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding intercompany loan balance including accrued interest between our Korean subsidiary and our\nDutch subsidiary was $677.3 million. Foreign currency translation gain or loss from intercompany balances was included in determining our consolidated net income since the intercompany balances were not considered long-term investments in nature because management intended to settle these intercompany balances at their respective maturity dates.\nOthers, Net. Others were comprised of gains and losses on the valuation of derivatives which were designated as hedging instruments, rental income and interest income. Others for the year ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were $2.9 million and $3.0 million, respectively.\nIncome Tax Expenses (Benefits)\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions and our effective tax rate is affected by changes in the mix of earnings between countries with differing tax rates. Our primary foreign operations are in Korea where the statutory tax rate applicable to us was approximately 24.2% in 2017 and 2016. Statutory tax rates for all foreign subsidiaries were less than the US federal statutory rate of 35.0%.\nWe recorded income tax expenses of $1.2 million and $3.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in income tax expenses in 2017 was primarily attributable to our revised tax positions in connection with our Korean subsidiary. The effective tax rate was 1.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to negative for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nWe make an ongoing assessment regarding the realization of US and non-US deferred tax assets. The valuation allowances at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were primarily attributable to deferred tax assets for the uncertainty in taxable income at our Korean subsidiary for which we have recorded a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets, net of its deferred tax liabilities, and against certain of our foreign subsidiaries' deferred tax assets pertaining to their related tax loss carry-forwards and tax credits that are not anticipated to generate a tax benefit.\nNet Income\nAs a result of the foregoing, net income increased by $114.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. As discussed above, the increase primarily resulted from a $36.5 million increase in operating income and an $80.9 million increase in foreign currency gain, which was partially offset by a $5.3 million increase in interest expense recorded for the Exchangeable Notes issued in January 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal capital requirements are to fund sales and marketing, invest in research and development and capital equipment, to make debt service payments and to fund working capital needs. We calculate working capital as current assets less current liabilities.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, our cash flows from operations and our financing activities. Our ability to manage cash and cash equivalents may be limited, as our primary cash flows are dictated by the terms of our sales and supply agreements, contractual obligations, debt instruments and legal and regulatory requirements. From time to time, we may sell accounts receivable to third parties under factoring agreements or engage in accounts receivable discounting to facilitate the collection of cash. For a description of our factoring arrangements and accounts receivable discounting, please see \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 3. Accounts Receivable\u201d included elsewhere in this Report. In addition, from time to time, we may make payments to our vendors on extended terms with their consent. As of December 31, 2018, we do not have any accounts payable on extended terms or payment deferment with our vendors.\nWe currently believe that we will have sufficient cash reserves from cash on hand and expected cash from operations to fund our operations as well as capital expenditures for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future.\nAs of December 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents held by our Korean subsidiary were $109.0 million, which represents 82% of our total cash and cash equivalents of $132.4 million on a consolidated basis. We, as a holding company resident in the United States, issued our 2021 Notes. Payments under our outstanding 2021 Notes are currently funded in part by our Korean subsidiary's repayment of its existing loans from our Dutch subsidiary, with our Dutch subsidiary using such repayments in turn to repay the loans owed to our Luxembourg subsidiary, which repays loans owed to us. Our Exchangeable Notes were issued by our Luxembourg subsidiary and the proceeds from the Exchangeable Notes Offering, were transferred to our Dutch and Korean subsidiaries through intercompany loans. Therefore, we expect payments under the Exchangeable Notes to be funded in part by our Korean subsidiary's repayment of its existing or new loans from our Dutch subsidiary, with our Dutch subsidiary using such repayments in turn to repay loans owed to our Luxembourg subsidiary.\nWe may, from time to time, repurchase a portion of our outstanding 2021 Notes and our Exchangeable Notes through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions subject to prevailing market conditions and our available cash reserves.\nYear ended December 31, 2018 compared to year ended December 31, 2017\nAs of December 31, 2018, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $132.4 million, a $3.9 million increase, compared to $128.6 million as of December 31, 2017. The increase resulted from a $39.2 million of cash inflow provided by operating activities and a $1.3 million of cash inflow provided by financing activities, which was partially offset by a $33.3 million of cash outflow used in investing activities.\nCash inflow provided by operating activities totaled $39.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $20.3 million of cash outflow used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net operating cash inflow for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflects our net loss of $3.9 million, as adjusted favorably by $86.3 million, which mainly consisted of depreciation and amortization, provision for severance benefits and net foreign currency loss, and net unfavorable impact of $43.1 million from changes of operating assets and liabilities.\nOur working capital balance as of December 31, 2018 was $220.1 million compared to $192.1 million as of December 31, 2017. The $28.0 million increase was primarily attributable to a $38.2 million increase in unbilled accounts receivable, which was a new item created in our balance sheet beginning January 1, 2018 to conform with the new revenue recognition standard and represented our contractual right to consideration for manufacturing work performed on a customer contract or an individual purchase order basis, which had not been invoiced to the customer. This increase was offset in part by a $12.0 million decrease in account receivables.\nCash outflow used in investing activities totaled $33.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $35.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $2.1 million decrease in investing activities was attributable to a $5.7 million net decrease in hedge collateral, which was partially offset by a $3.6 million net increase in guarantee deposits.\nCash inflow generated by financing activities totaled $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $72.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The financing cash inflow for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to proceeds of $4.3 million in connection with the water treatment facility arrangement and $1.1 million of proceeds received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options, which was offset in part by the payment of $2.2 million for the repurchases of 2021 Notes and Exchangeable Notes in December 2018 and $1.6 million for the repurchase of our common stock in December 2018 pursuant to our stock repurchase plan. The financing cash inflow for the year ended December 31, 2017 consisted of $80.3 million of net proceeds received from the issuance of the Exchangeable\nNotes and $3.7 million of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options, which was partly offset by the payment of $11.4 million for the repurchase of 1,795,444 shares of our common stock in January 2017 pursuant to our stock repurchase plan.\nWe routinely make capital expenditures for fabrication facility maintenance, enhancement of our existing facilities and reinforcement of our global research and development capability. For the year ended December 31, 2018, capital expenditures for plant, property and equipment were $33.2 million, a $0.6 million, or 1.7%, increase from $32.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2018 included a $4.3 million payment for the purchase of the water treatment facility. The remaining expenditures were related to meeting our customer demand, and supporting technology and facility improvements at our fabrication facilities.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2016\nAs of December 31, 2017, our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balance was $128.6 million, a $27.0 million increase, compared to $101.6 million as of December 31, 2016. The increase resulted from a $72.7 million of cash inflow provided by financing activities, which was partially offset by a $20.3 million of cash outflow used in operating activities and a $35.4 million of cash outflow used in investing activities.\nCash outflow used in operating activities totaled $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $9.4 million of cash inflow provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016. The net operating cash outflow for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflects our net income of $84.9 million and non-cash adjustments of a net negative $37.7 million, which mainly consisted of depreciation and amortization, provision for severance benefits and net foreign currency gain, and a net decrease in operating assets and liabilities of $67.5 million. The decrease in operating assets and liabilities was primarily related to an increase in accounts receivable as of December 31, 2017 due to a significant decrease in accounts receivable discounting during 2017 and the payments of statutory severance to the employees that resigned from our Company.\nOur working capital balance as of December 31, 2017 was $192.1 million compared to $89.3 million as of December 31, 2016. The $102.9 million increase was primarily attributable to a $45.2 million increase in cash and cash equivalents, a $30.3 million increase in account receivables, a $16.0 million increase in inventory and a $16.5 million decrease in deposits received, which were partially offset by an $18.3 million decrease in restricted cash and a $14.4 million increase in account payables.\nCash outflow used in investing activities totaled $35.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to cash inflow provided by investing activities totaled $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $36.4 million increase was attributable to a $16.4 million decrease in proceeds from disposal of plant, property and equipment, a $13.9 million net increase in capital expenditures and a $7.0 million net increase in hedge collateral, which was partially offset by a $1.0 million net decrease in guarantee deposits.\nCash inflow generated by financing activities totaled $72.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $71.0 million increase was primarily was attributable to $80.3 million of net proceeds received from the issuance of the Exchangeable Notes and a $2.0 million increase in proceeds received from exercised stock options, which was partly offset by the payment of $11.4 million for the repurchase of 1,795,444 shares of our common stock in January 2017 pursuant to our stock repurchase plan.\nWe routinely make capital expenditures for fabrication facility maintenance, enhancement of our existing facilities and reinforcement of our global research and development capability. For the year ended December 31, 2017, capital expenditures for plant, property and equipment were $32.7 million, a $13.9 million, or 74.4%, increase from $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was mainly for meeting our customer demand, and supporting technology and facility improvements at our fabrication facilities.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In millions) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Exchangeable Notes(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>95.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>86.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior notes(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>269.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>239.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Water Treatment Services(3)(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Others(5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td> Interest payments as well as $84.66 million aggregate principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes outstanding as of December 31, 2018, which bear interest at a rate of 5.0% per annum and are scheduled to mature in 2021 if not earlier converted.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td>(2) </td> <td> Interest payments as well as $224.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes outstanding as of December 31, 2018, which bear interest at a rate of 6.625% per annum and are scheduled to mature in 2021 if not earlier redeemed.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td>(3) </td> <td> Assumes constant currency exchange rate for Korean won to US dollars of 1,118.1:1, the exchange rate as of December 31, 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td>(4) </td> <td> Includes future payments for water treatment services for our fabrication facilities in Korea based on the contractual terms.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table> <tr> <td>(5) </td> <td> Includes license agreements, funding obligations for the accrued severance benefits and other contractual obligations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The indentures relating to the Exchangeable Notes and the 2021 Notes contain covenants as detailed in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 10. Long-term Borrowings\u201d in this Report. Those covenants are subject to a number of exceptions and qualifications. Certain of those restrictive covenants will terminate if the Exchangeable Notes or the 2021 Notes are rated investment grade at any time.\nWe lease land, office space and equipment under various operating lease agreements that expire through 2034.\nWe are a party to arrangements for the water treatment facilities in Cheongju and Gumi, Korea, which include 5-year and 10-year service agreements, respectively.\nBeginning in July 2018, we have contributed a certain percentage of severance benefits, accrued for eligible employees for their services beginning January 1, 2018, to certain severance insurance deposit accounts. These accounts consist of time deposits and other guaranteed principal and interest, and are maintained at insurance companies, banks or security companies for the benefit of employees. We deduct the contributions made to these severance insurance deposit accounts from our accrued severance benefits. As of December 31, 2018, our accrued severance benefits totaled $146.0 million and cumulative contributions to these severance insurance deposit accounts amounted to $2.5 million. Our related cash payments for future contributions are $2.7 million and $3.6 million for 2019 and 2020, respectively, to the extent that our obligations are contractual, fixed and reasonably estimable.\nWe follow US GAAP guidance on uncertain tax positions. Our unrecognized tax benefits totaled $0.4 million as of December 31, 2018. These unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the above table because we cannot estimate the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nPreparing financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, the\nreported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and the related disclosures in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\nWe believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical due to the fact that they involve a high degree of judgment and estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. We base these estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and other assumptions and information that we believe to be reasonable. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Accordingly, these estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the business environment in which we operate changes.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when it satisfies the performance obligation of transferring control over a product or service to a customer. Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer, which consideration is paid in exchange for a product or service.\nOur Foundry Services Group manufactures products, which we refer to as foundry products, based on customers' specific product designs. We recognize revenue over time for foundry products that do not have an alternative use when we have an enforceable right to payment. Revenue recognized over time is in proportion of wafer manufacturing costs incurred relative to total estimated costs for completion. However, in certain circumstances, pursuant to a customer contract or an individual purchase order, we may not have an enforceable right to payment for services performed at a given time. In this situation, we recognize revenue at the time when a customer obtains control of the product, which is generally upon product shipment, delivery at the customer's location or upon customer acceptance, depending on the terms of the arrangement.\nOur Standards Products Group sells products manufactured based on our design. Our products are either standardized with an alternative use or we do not have an enforceable right to payment for the related manufacturing services completed to date. For those products, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of the product, which is generally upon product shipment, delivery at the customer's location or upon customer acceptance, depending on the terms of the arrangement.\nA portion of our sales are made through distributors for which we apply the same revenue recognition guidance described above. We defer the recognition of revenue when a distributor receives consideration from the customers prior to the performance obligation being fulfilled. These amounts are classified as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets.\nWe provide warranty provisions under which customers can return defective products. We also provide allowances for additional products that may have to be provided free of charge to compensate customers for not meeting previously agreed upon yield criteria, which we refer to as the low yield compensation reserve. We estimate the costs related to warranty claims, repair or replacements and low yield compensation reserves, and record them as components of cost of sales.\nIn addition, we offer sales returns (other than those that relate to defective products under warranty), cash discounts for early payments, volume discounts and certain allowances to our customers, including our distributors. We record reserves for those returns, discounts and allowances as a deduction from sales, based on historical experience and other quantitative and qualitative factors.\nSubstantially all of our contracts are one year or less in duration. The standard payment terms with customers are generally thirty to sixty days from the time of shipment, product delivery to the customer's location or customer acceptance, depending on the terms of the related arrangement.\nSales of Accounts Receivable\nWe account for transfers of financial assets under ASC 860, \u201cTransfers and Servicing,\u201d as either sales or financings. Transfers of financial assets that result in sales accounting are those in which (1) the transfer legally\nisolates the transferred assets from the transferor, (2) the transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the transferred assets and no condition both constrains the transferee's right to pledge or exchange the assets and provides more than a trivial benefit to the transferor and (3) the transferor does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets. If the transfer does not meet these criteria, the transfer is accounted for as a financing. Financial assets that are treated as sales are removed from our accounts with any realized gain or loss reflected in earnings during the period of sale.\nProduct Warranties\nWe record, in other current liabilities, warranty liabilities for the estimated costs that may be incurred under our basic limited warranty. The standard limited warranty period is one to two years for the majority of products. This warranty covers defective products, and related liabilities are accrued when product revenues are recognized. Factors that affect our warranty liabilities include historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and repair or replacement costs per claim to satisfy our warranty obligation. We also record, in other current liabilities, low yield compensation reserves for our estimated costs for products that may have to be provided free of charge to compensate customers for not meeting previously agreed upon yield criteria. Factors that affect our low yield compensation reserves include historical and anticipated rates of claims for not meeting previously agreed upon yield criteria. We periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and low yield compensation reserves, and adjust our estimates when necessary.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, using the first in, first out method (\u201cFIFO\u201d). If net realizable value is less than cost at the balance sheet date, the carrying amount is reduced to the realizable value, and the difference is recognized as a loss on valuation of inventories within cost of sales. Inventory reserves are established when conditions indicate that the net realizable value is less than costs due to physical deterioration, obsolescence, changes in price levels, or other causes based on individual facts and circumstances. We evaluate the sufficiency of inventory reserves and take into consideration historical usage, expected demand, anticipated sales price, new product development schedules, the effect new products might have on the sale of existing products, product age and other factors. Reserves are also established for excess inventory based on our current inventory levels and projected demand and our ability to sell those specific products. Situations that could cause these inventory reserves include a decline in business and economic conditions, decline in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decline in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and consumer requirements, or failure to estimate end customer demand properly. A reduction of these inventory reserves may be recorded if previously reserved items are subsequently sold as a result of unexpected changes to certain aforementioned situations.\nThe gross amount of inventory reserves charged to cost of sales totaled $6.0 million, $4.8 million and $7.6 million in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The new cost base related to the sale of inventory that was previously written down totaled $1.8 million, $3.8 million and $5.0 million in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nAs prescribed in ASC 330, \u201cInventory,\u201d once a reserve is established for a particular item based on our assessment as described above, it is maintained until the related item is sold or scrapped as a new cost basis has been established that cannot subsequently be marked up. In addition, the cost of inventories is determined based on the normal capacity of each fabrication facility. In case the capacity utilization is lower than a certain level that management believes to be normal, the fixed overhead costs per production unit which exceed those under normal capacity are charged to cost of sales rather than capitalized as inventories.\nVendor Rebates\nWe, from time to time, entered into arrangements whereby rebates are obtained from vendors when we achieve certain levels of purchases. The vendor rebates are computed at an agreed upon amount or percentage of\npurchase levels. As these vendor rebates are impacted by actual and estimated purchases for the applicable agreed upon period, we periodically assess the progress of our purchase levels and revise the estimates when necessary. We account for such rebates as a reduction of inventory until we sell the product, at which time such rebates are reflected as a reduction of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations. Vendor rebates recorded as a reduction of cost of sales were $0.4 million, $0.4 million and $4.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and recorded as a reduction of inventory were $0, $0 and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 360, \u201cProperty, Plant and Equipment\u201d. Recoverability is measured by comparing its carrying amount with the future net undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the assets and the fair value of assets using the present value of the future net cash flows generated by the respective long-lived assets.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets other than intellectual property include technology and customer relationships which are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from one to five years. Intellectual property assets acquired represent rights under patents, trademarks and property use rights and are amortized over their respective periods of benefit, ranging up to ten years, on a straight-line basis.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d (\u201cASC 740\u201d). ASC 740 requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in a company's financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when it is necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Income tax expense is the tax payable for the period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nWe recognize and measure uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return utilizing a two-step process. In the first step, recognition, we determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step addresses measurement of a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not criteria. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of greater than 50 percent of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 815, which requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value.\nUnder the provisions of ASC 815, we may designate a derivative instrument as hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are attributable to a particular risk (a \u201ccash flow hedge\u201d) or hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability (a \u201cfair value hedge\u201d). Special accounting for qualifying hedges allows the effective portion of a derivative instrument's gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the consolidated statements of operations and requires that a company formally document, designate and assess the effectiveness of the transactions that receive hedge accounting treatment.\nBoth at the inception of a hedge and on an ongoing basis, a hedge must be expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in cash flows or fair value attributable to the underlying risk being hedged. If we determine that a derivative instrument is no longer highly effective as a hedge, it discontinues hedge accounting prospectively and future changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in current earnings. We assess hedge effectiveness at the end of each quarter.\nIn accordance with ASC 815, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are cash flow hedges are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings in the period in which the hedged item affects earnings. Ineffective portions of a derivative instrument's change in fair value are immediately recognized in earnings. Derivative instruments that do not qualify, or cease to qualify, as hedges must be adjusted to fair value and the adjustments are recorded through net income (loss).\nThe cash flows from derivative instruments receiving hedge accounting treatment are classified in the same categories as the hedged items in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncement\nSee Note 1 \u201cBusiness, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report, for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption, which is incorporated herein by reference.", "item_7_truncated": "In our previous public filings, we had used a term \u201cactive matrix organic light emitting diodes (AMOLED)\u201d that described a display technology used in certain display driver ICs that we had designed and manufactured in our internal and external foundries. Beginning in the second quarter of 2017, we have used the term \u201cOLED\u201d instead of the term \u201cAMOLED\u201d in our public filings in order to be consistent with commonly accepted industry naming practices for this product category. There is no change to the products that we previously referred to as AMOLED display driver ICs.\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 815, which requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value.\nAs prescribed in ASC 330, \u201cInventory,\u201d once a reserve is established for a particular item based on our assessment as described above, it is maintained until the related item is sold or scrapped as a new cost basis has been established that cannot subsequently be marked up. In addition, the cost of inventories is determined based on the normal capacity of each fabrication facility. In case the capacity utilization is lower than a certain level that management believes to be normal, the fixed overhead costs per production unit which exceed those under normal capacity are charged to cost of sales rather than capitalized as inventories.\n Net sales in Korea for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased from $219.6 million to $279.9 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, or by $60.3 million, or 27.4%, primarily due to higher demand of large display applications for TVs and our foundry services from certain customers serving the mid-range smartphone and consumer electronics markets. Higher sales of premium power products and MOSFETs also had a favorable impact.\nfrom our Standards Products Group to our Foundry Services Group. The transferred non-OLED display business has technical and business characteristics more closely aligned with our Foundry Services business than with our Standard Products business, which resided within our Display solutions business line primarily as a result of a long standing customer relationship established in the past. The transferred non-OLED display business represented $33.0 million of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018. The corresponding non-OLED display business represented $30.3 million and $25.2 million of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n Net sales in Korea for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased from $279.9 million to $282.5 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, or by $2.6 million, or 0.9%, primarily due to higher sales of premium power product and an increase in revenue related to the introduction of new OLED display driver ICs, which was offset in part by a strategic reduction of low margin LCD business.\nTable 168: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\n(As adjusted) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nNet Sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nNet Sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change\nAmount </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>(In millions) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foundry Services Group\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>325.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>350.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(25.1 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Standard Products Group\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Display Solutions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>256.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>179.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Power Solutions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>169.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>149.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Standard Products Group\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>425.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>329.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> All other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.0 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>750.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>679.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>71.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSince 2007, we have designed and manufactured organic light emitting diodes (OLED) display driver ICs in our internal manufacturing facilities. As we expanded our design capabilities to products that require lower geometries unavailable at our existing manufacturing facilities, we began outsourcing manufacturing of certain OLED display driver ICs to an external foundry from the second half of 2015. This additional source of manufacturing is an increasingly important part of our supply chain management. By outsourcing manufacturing of advanced OLED products to external foundries, we are able to dynamically adapt to the changing customer requirements and address growing markets without substantial capital investments by us. Both at the internal manufacturing facilities and external foundries, we apply our unique OLED process patents as well as other intellectual property, proprietary process design kits and custom design-flow methodologies.\nIncome Tax Expenses\n \u2022 to evaluate the effectiveness of our enterprise level business strategies; \nStandard Products Group. Net sales from our Standard Products Group segment were $329.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a $59.2 million, or 15.2%, decrease compared to $388.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This substantial decrease was primarily due to a significant decrease in revenue related to our Display Solutions business line, partially offset by increase in revenue related to our Power Solutions

Net sales from our Foundry Services Group segment were $350.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a $51.3 million, or 17.1%, increase compared to net sales of $299.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to higher demand for our foundry services from certain customers serving the mid-range smartphone and consumer electronics markets and higher sales of certain products from a global power management IC foundry customer. These increases were partially offset by a net decrease in demand of our foundry services from a customer serving the high-end smartphone market.\nof net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease of $9.1 million, or 11.2%, was primarily attributable to a $6.7 million decrease in professional fees, which were mainly comprised of legal and consulting services and a $4.2 million charge related to an additional tax assessment and associated penalties and an administrative fine as a result of the tax audit conducted by the KNTS which concluded in the fourth quarter of 2017. These decreases were offset in part by an increase in employee compensation, including issuance of equity-based compensation.\nWe use the terms Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) throughout this Report. Adjusted EBITDA, as we define it, is a non-US GAAP measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated as EBITDA (as defined below), adjusted to exclude (i) restructuring and other gain, net, (ii) early termination charges, (iii) equity-based compensation expense, (iv) foreign currency loss (gain), net, (v) derivative valuation loss (gain), net, (vi) restatement related expenses (gain), (vii) secondary offering expense, (viii) loss on early extinguishment of long-term borrowings, net and (ix) other indemnification costs and reimbursement. EBITDA for the periods indicated is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, net, income tax expenses, and depreciation and amortization.\nNet Income\nWe report our financial results in two operating segments: Foundry Services Group and Standard Products Group. We identified these segments based on how we allocate resources and assess our performance.\nOur products and services require investments in capital equipment. Analog and mixed-signal manufacturing facilities and processes are typically distinguished by the design and process implementation expertise rather than the use of the most advanced equipment. Many of these processes also tend to migrate more slowly to smaller geometries due to technological barriers and increased costs. For example, some of our products use high-voltage technology that requires larger geometries and that may not migrate to smaller geometries for several years, if at all. As a result, our manufacturing base and strategy do not require substantial investment in leading edge process equipment for those products, allowing us to utilize our facilities and equipment over an extended period of time with moderate required capital investments. In addition, we are less likely to experience significant industry overcapacity, which can cause product prices to decline significantly. In general, we seek to invest in manufacturing capacity that can be used for multiple high-value applications over an extended period of time. In addition, we outsource manufacturing of those products which do require advanced technology and 12-inch wafer capacity. We believe this capital investment strategy enables us to optimize our capital investments and facilitates more diversified product and service offerings.\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d (\u201cASC 740\u201d). ASC 740 requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in a company's financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when it is necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Income tax expense is the tax payable for the period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nWe are in a period of weaker demand from our foundry customers in part as a result of recent softening global market conditions, including macroeconomic uncertainties. This, together with significantly lower than expected utilization, among other factors will adversely impact our Foundry Services Group gross margin and other operating results, and such impact likely will be material. We are also currently evaluating a number of options to optimize our foundry operations and expense structure with an intent toward maximizing shareholder value.\nAll Other.

The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in demand of low margin product sales from a global power management IC foundry customer and a decrease in demand from a customer serving the low- to mid-range mobile phone market. This decrease was offset in part by an increase in sales of certain battery charger related products from a global power management IC foundry customer.\nWe provide warranty provisions under which customers can return defective products. We also provide allowances for additional products that may have to be provided free of charge to compensate customers for not meeting previously agreed upon yield criteria, which we refer to as the low yield compensation reserve.

The valuation allowances at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were primarily attributable to deferred tax assets for the uncertainty in taxable income at our Korean subsidiary for which we have recorded a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets, net of its deferred tax liabilities, and against certain of our foreign subsidiaries' deferred tax assets pertaining to their related tax loss carry-forwards and tax credits that are not anticipated to generate a tax benefit.\nAs a result of the foregoing, operating income increased by an $8.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. As discussed above, the increase in operating income resulted from a $10.2 million increase in gross profit, a $9.1 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses and a $13.4 million decrease in early termination charges, which were partially offset by a $17.0 million decrease in restructuring and other gain and a $7.5 million increase in research development expenses.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited consolidated interim financial statements, together in each case with the related notes, included elsewhere in this Report. This discussion and analysis contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Report.\nFoundry Services Group. Gross profit from our Foundry Services Group segment was $101.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a $28.7 million, or 39.3%, increase compared to $73.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased to 29.0% compared to 24.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was mainly attributable to a better product mix, a higher utilization rate and a favorable impact from reduction in headcount, which was offset in part primarily by an increase in wafer price and employee costs associated with unused vacation.\nIn December 2017, the KNTS concluded that no criminal charges would be brought against any current officers or directors of MSK or MSK itself. As a result, we took a charge of $4.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to this additional tax assessment and associated penalties and administrative fine. We recorded the $0.5 million related to employee withholding amounts as other receivables in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017, as we expected to obtain reimbursement of the applicable amounts from those employees. Of the $0.5 million, we have collected $0.1 million and established an allowance of $0.4 million and recorded it as selling, general and administrative expense for the three months ended September 30, 2018.\nThe gross amount of inventory reserves charged to cost of sales totaled $6.0 million, $4.8 million and $7.6 million in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The new cost base related to the sale of inventory that was previously written down totaled $1.8 million, $3.8 million and $5.0 million in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In millions) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income (Loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3.9 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>84.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(29.6 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EBITDA\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>134.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring and other gain, net(a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17.0 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.5 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Early termination charges(b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity-based compensation expense(c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign currency loss (gain), net(d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(65.5 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Derivative valuation loss (gain), net(e)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.2 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restatement related expenses (gain)(f)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.8 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Secondary offering expenses(g)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on early extinguishment of long-term borrowings, net(h)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other indemnification costs and reimbursement(i)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>84.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>78.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and Development. The rapid technological change and product obsolescence that characterize our industry require us to make continuous investments in research and development. Product development time frames vary but, in general, we incur research and development costs one to two years before generating sales from the associated new products. These expenses include personnel costs for members of our engineering workforce, cost of photomasks, silicon wafers and other non-recurring engineering charges related to product design. Additionally, we develop base line process technology through experimentation and through the design and use of characterization wafers that help achieve commercially feasible yields for new products. The majority of research and development expenses of our Foundry Services Group are for process development that serves as a common technology platform for all of our product lines. For our Standard Products Group, the majority of research and development expenses are material-related costs for OLED display driver IC product development involving fine processes.\nTable 166:

our customers, including our distributors. We record reserves for those returns, discounts and allowances as a deduction from sales, based on historical experience and other quantitative and qualitative factors.\nOur working capital balance as of December 31, 2018 was $220.1 million compared to $192.1 million as of December 31, 2017. The $28.0 million increase was primarily attributable to a $38.2 million increase in unbilled accounts receivable, which was a new item created in our balance sheet beginning January 1, 2018 to conform with the new revenue recognition standard and represented our contractual right to consideration for manufacturing work performed on a customer contract or an individual purchase order basis, which had not been invoiced to the customer. This increase was offset in part by a $12.0 million decrease in account receivables.\n2016. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was due to both our Foundry Services Group and Standard Products Group segments as described below.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nworldwide customer base, if we are not effective in competing in these markets our operating results may be adversely affected.\nIncome Tax Expenses (Benefits)\nOperating Expenses\nWithin our Foundry Services Group, net sales are driven by customers' decisions on which manufacturing services provider to use for a particular product. Most of our Foundry Services Group customers are fabless, while some are IDM customers. A customer will often have more than one supplier of manufacturing services. In any given period, our net sales depend heavily upon the end-market demand for the goods in which the products we manufacture for customers are used, the inventory levels maintained by our customers and in some cases, allocation of demand for manufacturing services among selected qualified suppliers.\nPrior to the adoption of the new revenue standard effective on January 1, 2018, we had historically recognized revenue when risk and reward of ownership pass to the customer either upon shipment, upon product delivery at the customer's location or upon customer acceptance, depending on the terms of the arrangement. After the adoption of the new revenue standard effective on January 1, 2018, we recognize revenue over time for those foundry products without alternative use where we have an enforceable right to payment for the related foundry services completed to date. As we adopted the new revenue standard under the modified retrospective method, we have not changed the comparative information in our interim consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. Such comparative information continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for that period. See \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 1-Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies-Basis of Presentation and Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in this Report for further discussion. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we sold products to 370 and 343 customers, respectively, and our net sales to our ten largest customers represented 61% and 57% of our net sales, respectively. We have a combined production capacity of approximately 113,000 semiconductor wafers per month. We believe our large-scale, cost-effective fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly adjust our production levels to meet shifts in demand by our end customers.\n \u2022 Adjusted Net Income (Loss) does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of issuing equity-based compensation to our management team and employees; \nInterest Expense. Our interest expense was incurred primarily under our 2021 Notes and our Exchangeable Notes.\n (c) This adjustment eliminates the impact of non-cash equity-based compensation expenses. Although we expect to incur non-cash equity-based compensation expenses in the future, these expenses do not generally require cash settlement, and, therefore, are not used by us to assess the profitability of our operations. We believe that analysts and investors will find it helpful to review our operating performance without the effects of these non-cash expenses as supplemental information. \nTo maintain and increase our profitability, we must accurately forecast trends in demand for electronics devices that incorporate semiconductor products we produce. We must understand our customers' needs as well as the likely end market trends and demand in the markets they serve. We must balance the likely manufacturing utilization demand of our product businesses and foundry business to optimize our capacity utilization. We must also invest in relevant research and development activities and manufacturing capacity and purchase necessary materials on a timely basis to meet our customers' demand while maintaining our target margins and cash flow.\nOperating Income\nOther Income (Expense)\nOn December 10, 2015, we entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with the plaintiffs' representatives to settle the Class Action Litigation, as defined and detailed in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in this Report, for an aggregate settlement payment of $23.5 million. This settlement payment was fully funded by insurance proceeds that were received in the first quarter of 2016 and disbursed from the escrow account, previously recorded as restricted cash, in the third quarter of 2016.\nCash inflow provided by operating activities totaled $39.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $20.3 million of cash outflow used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net operating cash inflow for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflects our net loss of $3.9 million, as adjusted favorably by $86.3 million, which mainly consisted of depreciation and amortization, provision for severance benefits and net foreign currency loss, and net unfavorable impact of $43.1 million from changes of operating assets and liabilities.\nRevenue Recognition\n (a) For the year ended December 31, 2017, this adjustment eliminates the $16.6 million restructuring gain on sale of a building in connection with the closure of our 6-inch fab and the $0.4 million gain on sale of our sensor business. For the year ended December 31, 2016, this adjustment eliminates the $7.8 million restructuring gain on sale of machinery in connection with the closure of our 6-inch fab, net of $2.3 million training and transition costs related to our 6-inch fab employees. \nWe record, in other current liabilities, warranty liabilities for the estimated costs that may be incurred under our basic limited warranty. The standard limited warranty period is one to two years for the majority of products. This warranty covers defective products, and related liabilities are accrued when product revenues are recognized. Factors that affect our warranty liabilities include historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and repair or replacement costs per claim to satisfy our warranty obligation. We also record, in other current liabilities, low yield compensation reserves for our estimated costs for products that may have to be provided free of charge to compensate customers for not meeting previously agreed upon yield criteria. Factors that affect our low yield compensation reserves include historical and anticipated rates of claims for not meeting previously agreed upon yield criteria. We periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and low yield compensation reserves, and adjust our estimates when necessary.\nFoundry Services Group. Gross profit from our Foundry Services Group segment was $82.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a $19.2 million, or 18.9%, decrease compared to $101.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased to 25.4% compared to 29.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was mainly attributable to a lower utilization rate, which was affected in part by a softening global market conditions, including macroeconomic uncertainties, and a strategic reduction of low margin LCD business. This decrease was also attributable to an unfavorable product mix and an increase in raw wafer prices.\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under US GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n (d) This adjustment mainly eliminates the impact of non-cash foreign currency translation associated with intercompany debt obligations and foreign currency denominated receivables and payables, as well as the cash impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses on collection of such receivables and payment of such payables. Although we expect to incur foreign currency translation gains or losses in the future, we believe that analysts and investors will find it helpful to review our operating performance without the effects of these primarily non-cash gains or losses, which we cannot control. Additionally, we believe the isolation of this adjustment provides investors with enhanced comparability to prior and future periods of our operating performance results. \nRepurchase of Long-term Borrowings\nDutch subsidiary was $677.3 million. Foreign currency translation gain or loss from intercompany balances was included in determining our consolidated net income since the intercompany balances were not considered long-term investments in nature because management intended to settle these intercompany balances at their respective maturity dates.\nIn March 2017, we sold our sensor product business, which was included in and reported as part of the Display Solutions line of our Standard Products Group, to a third party for proceeds of $1.3 million, in an effort to improving our overall profitability. We recorded a $0.4 million gain from this sale after deducting the book values of certain assets transferred to the buyer.\nA portion of our sales are made through distributors for which we apply the same revenue recognition guidance described above. We defer the recognition of revenue when a distributor receives consideration from the customers prior to the performance obligation being fulfilled. These amounts are classified as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets.\nOn May 1, 2017, the SEC announced that it had reached a final settlement with us, resolving the SEC's investigation, as detailed in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in this Report. In connection therewith, we have consented, without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, to the entry of an administrative order by the SEC directing that we cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of certain provisions of the federal securities laws and related SEC regulations. The SEC's administrative order was entered on May 1, 2017. The SEC imposed a monetary penalty of $3.0 million on us. In the three months ended March 31, 2017, we established a reserve in that amount for the potential settlement of this matter and recorded it as selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The reserved monetary penalty of $3.0 million was paid to the SEC during the three months ended June 30, 2017.\n (d) This adjustment mainly eliminates the impact of non-cash foreign currency translation associated with intercompany debt obligations and foreign currency denominated receivables and payables, as well as the cash impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses on collection of such receivables and payment of such payables. Although we expect to incur foreign currency translation gains or losses in the future, we believe that analysts and investors will find it helpful to review our operating performance without the effects of these primarily non-cash gains or losses, which we cannot control. Additionally, we believe the isolation of this adjustment provides investors with enhanced comparability to prior and future periods of our operating performance results. \nImpact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates on Reported Results of Operations. Historically, a portion of our revenues and greater than the majority of our operating expenses and costs of sales have been denominated in non-US currencies, principally the Korean won, and we expect that this will remain true in the future. Because we report our results of operations in US dollars converted from our non-US revenues and expenses based on monthly average exchange rates, changes in the exchange rate between the Korean won and the US dollar could materially impact our reported results of operations and distort period to period comparisons. In particular, because of the difference in the amount of our consolidated revenues and expenses that are in US dollars relative to Korean won, depreciation in the US dollar relative to the Korean won could result in a material increase in reported costs relative to revenues, and therefore could cause our profit margins and operating income (loss) to appear to decline materially, particularly relative to prior periods. The converse is true if the US dollar were to appreciate relative to the Korean won. Moreover, our foreign currency gain or loss would be affected by changes in the exchange rate between the Korean won and the US dollar as a substantial portion of non-cash translation gain or loss is associated with the intercompany long-term loans to our Korean subsidiary, which is denominated in US dollars. As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding intercompany loan balance including accrued interest between our Korean subsidiary and our Dutch subsidiary was $666.6 million. This amount included an intercompany loan of $75.0 million executed during the three months ended March 31, 2017, which was used to transfer a portion of the net proceeds from the offering of the Exchangeable Notes from our Luxembourg subsidiary to our Dutch subsidiary, and then to our Korean subsidiary. As a result of such foreign currency fluctuations, it could be more difficult to detect underlying trends in our business and results of operations. In addition, to the extent that fluctuations in currency exchange rates cause our results of operations to differ from our expectations or the expectations of our investors, the trading price of our stock could be adversely affected.\nOn February 14, 2019, we announced that we have undertaken a strategic evaluation of our Foundry Services Group business and fabrication facility located in Cheongju (\u201cFab 4\u201d), the larger of our two 8\u201d manufacturing facilities. Fab 4 is an analog and mixed signal fab that produces approximately 73% of our total capacity, and is used primarily to meet wafer demand from customers of our Foundry Services Group that rely on outside suppliers. The strategic evaluation is expected to include a range of possible options, including, but not limited to, joint ventures, strategic partnerships as well as M&A possibilities. We have engaged J.P. Morgan Securities LLC as our financial advisor to assist in the evaluation. It is possible that the announced strategic evaluation of our Foundry Services Group business and Fab 4 could adversely impact foundry loadings and Company margins.\nWe recognize revenue when it satisfies the performance obligation of transferring control over a product or service to a customer. Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer, which consideration is paid in exchange for a product or service.\nDepreciation Expense. We periodically evaluate the carrying values of long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, as well as the related depreciation periods. We depreciated our property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of our assets. Depreciation rates vary from 30-40 years on buildings to 5 to 12 years for certain equipment and assets. Our evaluation of carrying values is based on various analyses including cash flow and profitability projections. If our projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying values of the related long-lived assets, the carrying value of the assets is impaired and will be reduced, with the reduction charged to expense so that the carrying value is equal to fair value.\n \u2022 other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted Net Income (Loss) differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.  Because of these limitations, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) should not be considered as a measure of profitability of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our US GAAP results and using Adjusted Net Income (Loss) only supplementally.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses consist of the costs of various corporate operations, including finance, legal, human resources and other administrative functions. These expenses primarily consist of payroll-related expenses, consulting and other professional fees and office facility-related expenses.\nWe recorded income tax expenses of $1.2 million and $3.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in income tax expenses in 2017 was primarily attributable to our revised tax positions in connection with our Korean subsidiary. The effective tax rate was 1.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to negative for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe semiconductor markets in which we participate are highly competitive. The prices of our products tend to decrease regularly over their useful lives, and such price decreases can be significant as new generations of products are introduced by us or our competitors. We strive to offset the impact of declining selling prices for existing products through cost reductions and the introduction of new products that command selling prices above the average selling price of our existing products. In addition, we seek to manage our inventories and manufacturing capacity so as to mitigate the risk of losses from product obsolescence.\nNotes and $3.7 million of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options, which was partly offset by the payment of $11.4 million for the repurchase of 1,795,444 shares of our common stock in January 2017 pursuant to our stock repurchase plan.\n \u2022 we believe that Adjusted EBITDA, by eliminating the impact of a number of items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core ongoing operating performance, provides a more comparable measure of our operating performance from period-to-period and may be a better indicator of future performance; \n (f) This adjustment eliminates expenses in connection with the Audit Committee's independent investigation and related restatement and litigation, primarily comprised of legal, audit and consulting fees, and certain \nOn June 29, 2018, we entered into an arrangement whereby we acquired a water treatment facility to support our fabrication facility in Gumi, Korea from SK hynix for $4.2 million, and sold it for $4.2 million to a third party management company that we have engaged to run the facility for a 10-year term. This arrangement is accounted for as a financing due to our Korean subsidiary's continuing involvement with the facility. As a result, on the acquisition date, we recorded the water treatment facility of $4.2 million as property, plant and equipment, net, which is depreciated over its useful life. We also recorded the related liabilities of $0.6 million as other current liabilities and $3.6 million as other non-current liabilities, which relates to the financing and service portion of the arrangement and is amortized using the effective interest method over the contract period.\nAs of February 22, 2017, our Board of Directors approved the implementation of a headcount reduction plan (the \u201cHeadcount Reduction Plan\u201d). As of June 30, 2017, 352 employees elected to resign from the Company during the period in which the Headcount Reduction Plan was offered. The Headcount Reduction Plan is expected to result in estimated annual cost savings of approximately $24 million. The total cash cost of approximately $31 million has been fully paid. We recorded in our consolidated statement of operations $11.1 million and $2.3 million termination related charges as \u201cearly termination charges\u201d for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, respectively. The remaining total cost relates to statutory severance benefits, which are required by law and had already been fully accrued in our financial statements.\n\nA substantial portion of our net foreign currency gain or loss is non-cash translation gain or loss associated with the intercompany long-term loans to our Korean subsidiary, which is denominated in US dollars, and is affected by changes in the exchange rate between the Korean won and the US dollar. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding intercompany loan balance including accrued interest between our Korean subsidiary and our\n\nUnder the provisions of ASC 815, we may designate a derivative instrument as hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are attributable to a particular risk (a \u201ccash flow hedge\u201d) or hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability (a \u201cfair value hedge\u201d). Special accounting for qualifying hedges allows the effective portion of a derivative instrument's gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the consolidated statements of operations and requires that a company formally document, designate and assess the effectiveness of the transactions that receive hedge accounting treatment.\n (4) Includes future payments for water treatment services for our fabrication facilities in Korea based on the contractual terms. \nWe encourage you to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons we consider them appropriate. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure defined in accordance with US GAAP and should not be construed as an alternative to income from continuing operations, cash flows from operating activities or net income, as determined in accordance with US GAAP. A reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:\n \u2022 in communications with our Board of Directors concerning our consolidated financial performance; and \nCapital Expenditures. We primarily invest in manufacturing equipment, software design tools and other tangible assets mainly for fabrication facility maintenance, capacity expansion and technology improvement. Capacity expansions and technology improvements typically occur in anticipation of increases in demand. We typically pay for capital expenditures in partial installments with portions due on order, delivery and final acceptance. Our capital expenditures mainly include our payments for the purchase of property, plant and equipment.\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA in a number of ways, including:\nOperating Income (Loss)\nWe make an ongoing assessment regarding the realization of US and non-US deferred tax assets. The valuation allowances at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were primarily attributable to deferred tax assets for the uncertainty in taxable income at our Korean subsidiary for which we have recorded a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets, net of its deferred tax liabilities, and against certain of our foreign subsidiaries' deferred tax assets pertaining to their related tax loss carry-forwards and tax credits that are not anticipated to generate a tax benefit.\n (i) This adjustment eliminates a $0.4 million legal expense related to the indemnification of a former employee. As the legal expense for the former employee is borne by us under a negotiated separation agreement, we do not believe that this charge is indicative of our core operating performance and has been excluded for comparative purposes. \nExplanation and Reconciliation of Non-US GAAP Measures\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses were $70.5 million, or 10.4% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $72.2 million, or 10.5% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease of $1.7 million, or 2.3%, was primarily attributable to a decrease in salary expense as a result of our headcount reduction of non-key R&D personnel.\n eliminates the effects of financing, income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending, as well as other one time or recurring items described above; and \n \u2022 Foundry Services Group: Our Foundry Services Group provides specialty analog and mixed-signal foundry services to fabless semiconductor companies and IDMs that serve communications, IoT, consumer, industrial and automotive applications. We manufacture wafers based on our customers' product designs. We do not market these products directly to end customers but rather supply manufactured wafers and products to our customers to market to their end customers. We offer approximately 508 process flows to our foundry services customers. We also often partner with key customers to jointly develop or customize specialized processes that enable our customers to improve their products and allow us to develop unique manufacturing expertise. Our foundry services target customers who require differentiated, specialty analog \nResults of Operations-Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nOur Foundry Services Group manufactures products, which we refer to as foundry products, based on customers' specific product designs. We recognize revenue over time for foundry products that do not have an alternative use when we have an enforceable right to payment. Revenue recognized over time is in proportion of wafer manufacturing costs incurred relative to total estimated costs for completion. However, in certain circumstances, pursuant to a customer contract or an individual purchase order, we may not have an enforceable right to payment for services performed at a given time. In this situation, we recognize revenue at the time when a customer obtains control of the product, which is generally upon product shipment, delivery at the customer's location or upon customer acceptance, depending on the terms of the arrangement.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\n (e) This adjustment eliminates the impact of gain or loss recognized in income on derivatives, which represents hedge ineffectiveness or derivatives value changes excluded from the risk being hedged. We enter into derivative transactions to mitigate foreign exchange risks. As our derivative transactions are limited to a certain portion of our expected cash flows denominated in US dollars, and we do not enter into derivative transactions for trading or speculative purposes, we do not believe that these charges or gains are indicative of our core operating performance. \nWe recognize and measure uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return utilizing a two-step process. In the first step, recognition, we determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step addresses measurement of a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not criteria. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of greater than 50 percent of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\nOur success going forward will depend upon our ability to adapt to future challenges such as the emergence of new competitors for our products and services or the consolidation of current competitors. Additionally, we must innovate to remain ahead of, or at least rapidly adapt to, technological breakthroughs that may lead to a significant change in the technology necessary to deliver our products and services. We believe that our established relationships and close collaboration with leading customers enhance our awareness of new product opportunities, market and technology trends and improve our ability to adapt and grow successfully. In our Foundry Services Group, we strive to maintain competitiveness by offering high-value added processes, high-flexibility and excellent service by tailoring existing standard processes to meet customers' design needs and porting customers' own process technologies into our fabrication facilities.\nMaterial Costs. Our cost of material consists of costs of raw materials, such as silicon wafers, chemicals, gases and tape and packaging supplies. We use processes that require specialized raw materials, such as silicon wafers, that are generally available from a limited number of suppliers. If demand increases or supplies decrease, the costs of our raw materials could increase significantly.\nGross Profit\n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt; \nNet sales were $750.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a $71.2 million, or 10.5%, increase compared to $679.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue from our Standard Products Group, which was offset in part by a decrease in revenue from our Foundry Services Group.\nAs of December 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents held by our Korean subsidiary were $109.0 million, which represents 82% of our total cash and cash equivalents of $132.4 million on a consolidated basis. We, as a holding company resident in the United States, issued our 2021 Notes. Payments under our outstanding 2021 Notes are currently funded in part by our Korean subsidiary's repayment of its existing loans from our Dutch subsidiary, with our Dutch subsidiary using such repayments in turn to repay the loans owed to our Luxembourg subsidiary, which repays loans owed to us. Our Exchangeable Notes were issued by our Luxembourg subsidiary and the proceeds from the Exchangeable Notes Offering, were transferred to our Dutch and Korean subsidiaries through intercompany loans. Therefore, we expect payments under the Exchangeable Notes to be funded in part by our Korean subsidiary's repayment of its existing or new loans from our Dutch subsidiary, with our Dutch subsidiary using such repayments in turn to repay loans owed to our Luxembourg subsidiary.\nStandard Products Group. Gross profit from our Standard Products Group segment was $85.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a $2.4 million, or 2.8%, increase from $83.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased to 26.1% compared to 21.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was mainly attributable to a higher utilization rate and a favorable impact from reduction in headcount, which was offset in part primarily by an increase in wafer price and employee costs associated with unused vacation.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses were $78.0 million, or 10.4%, of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $70.5 million, or 10.4%, of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase of $7.5 million, or 10.7%, was primarily attributable to an increase in development activities for new OLED products.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nForeign Currency Gain (Loss), Net. Net foreign currency gain for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $65.5 million compared to net foreign currency loss of $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The net foreign currency gain for the year ended December 31, 2017 was due to the appreciation in value of the Korean won relative to the US dollar during the period. The net foreign currency loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 was due to the depreciation in value of the Korean won relative to the US dollar during the period.\n \u2022 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; \nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions and our effective tax rate is affected by changes in the mix of earnings between countries with differing tax rates. Our primary foreign operations are in Korea where the statutory tax rate applicable to us was approximately 24.2% in each of 2018 and 2017. Statutory tax rates for our foreign subsidiaries except those in Luxembourg, Netherlands and Korea, were less than the US federal statutory rate of 21.0%.\nOperating Expenses\nSales of Accounts Receivable\nRestructuring and Other Gain. Restructuring and other gain of $17.0 million recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from a $16.6 million restructuring gain on the sale of the building related to the closure of our 6-inch fab and a $0.4 million gain on sale of our sensor business.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $81.8 million, or 12.0% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $83.5 million, or 12.1% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease of $1.8 million, or 2.1%, was attributable to a $2.9 million decrease in salary expense as a result of our headcount reduction and a $6.6 million decrease in professional fees mainly comprised of legal and consulting services. These decreases were offset in part primarily by a $4.2 million charge of the additional tax assessment and associated penalties and administrative fine as a result of the tax audit conducted by the KNTS which concluded in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nContractual Obligations\nStandard Products Group. Net sales from our Standard Products Group segment were $425.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a $96.3 million, or 29.3%, increase compared to $329.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue related to an improvement in mobile OLED display driver ICs due to the introduction of new OLED smartphones by Chinese manufacturers and higher demand for premium power products such as high-end MOSFETs and IGBTs primarily for TV and industrial applications. This increase was offset in part by a strategic reduction of our lower margin LCD business.\n \u2022 Adjusted Net Income (Loss) does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018:\n\n (3) Assumes constant currency exchange rate for Korean won to US dollars of 1,118.1:1, the exchange rate as of December 31, 2018. \nSecondary offering\n (b) This adjustment eliminates the charges related to the reduction of workforce through the Headcount Reduction Plan in the first half of 2017 and the Program in the second quarter of 2016. As these termination related charges are recorded as a result of implementing the company-wide headcount reduction and are not \n (c) This adjustment eliminates the impact of non-cash equity-based compensation expenses. Although we expect to incur non-cash equity-based compensation expenses in the future, these expenses do not generally require cash settlement, and, therefore, are not used by us to assess the profitability of our operations. We believe that analysts and investors will find it helpful to review our operating performance without the effects of these non-cash expenses as supplemental information. \nWe routinely make capital expenditures for fabrication facility maintenance, enhancement of our existing facilities and reinforcement of our global research and development capability. For the year ended December 31, 2017, capital expenditures for plant, property and equipment were $32.7 million, a $13.9 million, or 74.4%, increase from $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was mainly for meeting our customer demand, and supporting technology and facility improvements at our fabrication facilities.\nAs a result of the foregoing, net income decreased by $88.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. As discussed above, the decrease primarily resulted from a $90.0 million increase in foreign currency loss and a $3.5 million increase in income tax expenses, which was partially offset by an $8.2 million increase in operating income.\nAs a result, the aggregate tax and penalty assessment by the KNTS was $6.0 million, of which $3.3 million had already been accrued by us in our financial statements in connection with the Restatement filed in 2015. Such amount also included approximately $0.5 million related to employee withholding amounts and associated penalties, and to the extent any such tax obligation was that of MSK's employees. In addition, KNTS assessed an administrative fine of $2.0 million in connection with the above-described tax audit.\n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; \nGross Profit. Our overall gross profit generally fluctuates as a result of changes in overall sales volumes and in the average selling prices of our products and services. Other factors that influence our gross profit include changes in product mix, the introduction of new products and services and subsequent generations of existing products and services, shifts in the utilization of our manufacturing facilities and the yields achieved by our manufacturing operations, changes in material, labor and other manufacturing costs including outsourced manufacturing expenses, and variation in depreciation expense.\n (h) This adjustment eliminates expenses related to the repurchase of a portion of the 2021 Notes and the Exchangeable Notes in December 2018. \nWe routinely make capital expenditures for fabrication facility maintenance, enhancement of our existing facilities and reinforcement of our global research and development capability. For the year ended December 31, 2018, capital expenditures for plant, property and equipment were $33.2 million, a $0.6 million, or 1.7%, increase from $32.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2018 included a $4.3 million payment for the purchase of the water treatment facility. The remaining expenditures were related to meeting our customer demand, and supporting technology and facility improvements at our fabrication facilities.\nWater Treatment Facility Arrangement\nNet sales in Asia Pacific for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased from $391.9 million to $322.6 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, or by $69.3 million, or 17.7%, primarily due to lower level of sales of OLED display driver ICs, which was partially offset by an increase in sales of certain products from higher demand for our foundry services.\nOthers, Net. Others were comprised of gains and losses on the valuation of derivatives which were designated as hedging instruments, rental income and interest income. Others for the year ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were $2.9 million and $3.0 million, respectively.\n \u2022 we believe that reporting Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is useful to readers in evaluating our core operating results because it eliminates the effects of non-cash expenses as well as the other items we discuss below, such as foreign currency gains and losses, which are out of our control and can vary significantly from period to period.  Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is not a measure defined in accordance with US GAAP and should not be construed as an alternative to income from continuing operations, cash flows from operating activities or net income, as determined in accordance with US GAAP. We encourage you to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons we consider them appropriate. Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted Net Income (Loss) differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted Net Income (Loss), you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation. We define Adjusted Net Income (Loss) for the periods indicated as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude (i) restructuring and other gain, net, (ii) early termination charges, (iii) equity-based compensation expense, (iv) foreign currency loss (gain), net, (v) derivative valuation loss (gain), net, (vi) restatement related expenses (gain), (vii) secondary offering expense, (viii) loss on early extinguishment of long-term borrowings, net and (ix) other indemnification costs and reimbursement.\nWe believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical due to the fact that they involve a high degree of judgment and estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. We base these estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and other assumptions and information that we believe to be reasonable. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Accordingly, these estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the business environment in which we operate changes.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $21.6 million compared to interest expense of $16.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase of $5.3 million was attributable to the interest expense recorded for the Exchangeable Notes issued in January 2017.\nTax Audit\nOn January 22, 2016, we entered into a stipulation of settlement with the plaintiffs in the shareholder derivative actions, as described in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in this Report, for an aggregate payment of $3.0 million from our insurance proceeds that were received in the first quarter of 2016 and recorded in the escrow account. In October 2016, the court approved the settlement of the shareholder derivative actions for $3.0 million, which included $0.75 million awarded to plaintiffs' counsel. Upon the expiration of the appeals period, $2.25 million was disbursed from the escrow account, previously recorded as restricted cash, in December 2016. The remaining restricted cash related to insurance proceeds of $3.1 million was also released in December 2016.\nOthers, Net. Others were comprised of gains and losses on the valuation of derivatives which were designated as hedging instruments, rental income and interest income. Others for the year ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were $0.3 million and $2.9 million, respectively.\nSale of Sensor Business\nWe lease land, office space and equipment under various operating lease agreements that expire through 2034.\nGross Profit\nNet Sales. We derive virtually all of our sales (net of sales returns and allowances) from two segments: Foundry Services Group and Standard Products Group. Our product inventory is primarily located in Korea and is available for drop shipment globally. Outside of Korea, we maintain limited product inventory, and our sales representatives generally relay orders to our factories in Korea for fulfillment. We have strategically located our sales and technical support offices near concentrations of major customers. Our sales offices are located in Korea, the United States, Japan and Greater China. Our network of authorized agents and distributors is in the United States, Europe and the Asia Pacific region. Our net sales from All other consist principally of the disposal of scrap materials.\n\n Net Sales\n\n other expenses. For 2018, this adjustment eliminates the reversal of a $0.8 million accrual related to certain legal fees incurred in prior periods and reimbursed by insurers in the first quarter of 2018. For 2017, this adjustment includes the $3.0 million civil penalty imposed by the SEC and the $4.3 million of the additional tax assessment and associated penalties, primarily related to non-income-based VAT transactions in the Restatement periods, administrative fine and related legal fees. As these expenses meaningfully impacted our operating results and are not expected to represent an ongoing operating expense to us, we believe our operating performance results are more usefully compared if these expenses are excluded. \nTotal gross profit was $198.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $187.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a $10.2 million, or 5.4%, increase. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased to 26.4% compared to 27.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to a decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales from our Foundry Services Group, which was offset in part by an increase in gross profits as a percentage of net sales from our Standard Products Group.\nIntangible assets other than intellectual property include technology and customer relationships which are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from one to five years. Intellectual property assets acquired represent rights under patents, trademarks and property use rights and are amortized over their respective periods of benefit, ranging up to ten years, on a straight-line basis.\nFactors Affecting Our Results of Operations\n \u2022 Adjusted Net Income (Loss) does not reflect the costs of holding certain assets and liabilities in foreign currencies; and \n \u2022 in certain of our compensation plans as a performance measure for determining incentive compensation payments. \nFrom time to time, we may engage in exchange rate hedging activities in an effort to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. Our Korean subsidiary enters into foreign currency forward and zero cost collar contracts in order to mitigate a portion of the impact of US dollar-Korean won exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results. Obligations under these foreign currency forward and zero cost collar contracts must be cash collateralized if our exposure exceeds certain specified thresholds. These forward and zero cost collar contracts may be terminated by the counterparty in a number of circumstances, including if our total cash and cash\nWe report net sales by geographic region based on the location to which the products are billed. The following table sets forth our net sales by geographic region and the percentage of total net sales represented by each geographic region for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nThere was no tax impact from the adjustments to net income to calculate our Adjusted Net Income (Loss) for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 due to net operating loss carry-forwards available to offset taxable income and full allowance for deferred tax assets. We believe that all adjustments to net income (loss) used to calculate Adjusted Net Income (Loss) were applied consistently to the periods presented.\nResults of Operations\n expected to represent ongoing operating expenses to us, we believe our operating performance results are more usefully compared if these expenses are excluded. \nSegment Change\nWe present Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as a further supplemental measure of our performance. We prepare Adjusted Net Income (Loss) by adjusting net income (loss) to eliminate the impact of a number of non-cash expenses and other items that may be either one time or recurring that we do not consider to be indicative of our core ongoing operating performance. We believe that Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is particularly useful because it reflects the impact of our asset base and capital structure on our operating performance. We present Adjusted Net Income (Loss) for a number of reasons, including:\npurchase levels. As these vendor rebates are impacted by actual and estimated purchases for the applicable agreed upon period, we periodically assess the progress of our purchase levels and revise the estimates when necessary. We account for such rebates as a reduction of inventory until we sell the product, at which time such rebates are reflected as a reduction of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations. Vendor rebates recorded as a reduction of cost of sales were $0.4 million, $0.4 million and $4.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and recorded as a reduction of inventory were $0, $0 and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOur wide variety of analog and mixed-signal semiconductor products and manufacturing services combined with our mature technology platform allow us to address multiple high-growth end markets and to rapidly develop and introduce new products and services in response to market demands. Our design center and substantial manufacturing operations in Korea place us at the core of the global electronics device supply chain. We believe this enables us to quickly and efficiently respond to our customers' needs and allows us to better serve and capture additional demand from existing and new customers.\nWe may, from time to time, repurchase a portion of our outstanding 2021 Notes and our Exchangeable Notes through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions subject to prevailing market conditions and our available cash reserves.\nWe report net sales by geographic region based on the location to which the products are billed. The following table sets forth our net sales by geographic region and the percentage of total net sales represented by each geographic region for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nAverage Selling Prices. Average selling prices for our products tend to be highest at the time of introduction of new products which utilize the latest technology and tend to decrease over time as such products mature in the market and are replaced by next generation products. We strive to offset the impact of declining selling prices for existing products through our product development activities and by introducing new products that command selling prices above the average selling price of our existing products. In addition, we seek to manage our inventories and manufacturing capacity so as to preclude losses from product and productive capacity obsolescence.\nOn August 15, 2017, certain of our stockholders that are affiliates of Avenue Capital Management II, L.P. (the \u201cSelling Stockholders\u201d) closed an underwritten registered public offering of 4,088,978 shares of our common stock at a price per share of $11.10. We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of our common stock by the Selling Stockholders, but paid certain expenses in connection with such secondary offering pursuant to an existing contractual arrangement with the Selling Stockholders.\nRestatement\nThe following table sets forth consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nInventories. We monitor our inventory levels in light of product development changes and market expectations. We may be required to take additional charges for quantities in excess of demand, cost in excess of market value and product age. Our analysis may take into consideration historical usage, expected demand, anticipated sales price, new product development schedules, the effect new products might have on the sales of existing products, product age, customer design activity, customer concentration and other factors. These forecasts require us to estimate our ability to predict demand for current and future products and compare those estimates with our current inventory levels and inventory purchase commitments. Our forecasts for our inventory may differ from actual inventory use.\nAs a result of the Restatement, we incurred substantial external accounting, legal and other related costs associated with the Restatement and certain litigation and other regulatory investigations and actions related thereto. We recorded Restatement related costs of $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which included tax assessment, and associated penalties of $4.3 million, primarily related to non-income-based VAT transactions in the Restatement periods, compared to $7.0 million of Restatement related costs for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the three months March 31, 2018, the reversal of a $0.8 million accrual related to certain legal fees, incurred in prior periods and reimbursed by insurers in the current quarter, was recorded as a Restatement related gain.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions and our effective tax rate is affected by changes in the mix of earnings between countries with differing tax rates. Our primary foreign operations are in Korea where the statutory tax rate applicable to us was approximately 24.2% in 2017 and 2016. Statutory tax rates for all foreign subsidiaries were less than the US federal statutory rate of 35.0%.\nAs a result of the foregoing, operating income increased by $36.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. As discussed above, the increase in operating income resulted from a $31.7 million increase in gross profit, a $1.8 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses, a $1.7 million decrease in research and development expenses and a $10.5 million increase in restructuring gain, which was partially offset by a $9.1 million increase in termination related charges.\n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of issuing equity-based compensation to our management team and employees; \nAs of December 21, 2016, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell a building located in Cheongju, South Korea. The building has historically been used to house the 6-inch fab and became vacant upon the closure of the fabrication facility. As of December 31, 2015, the building was fully impaired. We received proceeds of $18.2 million, including a $1.7 million value-added tax, for the sale of the building on December 26, 2016. We recorded the $18.2 million as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2016 as we were obligated to perform certain removal construction work that was expected to be completed by the end of March 2017. During the first quarter of 2017, we completed all removal construction work necessary to transfer the title of the building, and the $18.2 million of restricted cash was fully released.\nThe following table summarizes the adjustments to net income (loss) that we make in order to calculate Adjusted Net Income (Loss) for the periods indicated:\nSelling Expenses. We sell our products worldwide through a direct sales force as well as a network of sales agents and representatives to OEMs, including major branded customers and contract manufacturers, and\n (2) Interest payments as well as $224.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes outstanding as of December 31, 2018, which bear interest at a rate of 6.625% per annum and are scheduled to mature in 2021 if not earlier redeemed. \nWe are a designer and manufacturer of analog and mixed-signal semiconductor platform solutions for communications, IoT, consumer, industrial and automotive applications. We provide technology platforms for analog, mixed-signal, power, high voltage, non-volatile memory, and RF applications. We have a proven record with about 40 years of operating history, a portfolio of approximately 3,000 registered patents and pending applications and extensive engineering and manufacturing process expertise.\nCash inflow generated by financing activities totaled $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $72.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The financing cash inflow for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to proceeds of $4.3 million in connection with the water treatment facility arrangement and $1.1 million of proceeds received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options, which was offset in part by the payment of $2.2 million for the repurchases of 2021 Notes and Exchangeable Notes in December 2018 and $1.6 million for the repurchase of our common stock in December 2018 pursuant to our stock repurchase plan. The financing cash inflow for the year ended December 31, 2017 consisted of $80.3 million of net proceeds received from the issuance of the Exchangeable\nThe following table sets forth consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2016\nWe review property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 360, \u201cProperty, Plant and Equipment\u201d. Recoverability is measured by comparing its carrying amount with the future net undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the assets and the fair value of assets using the present value of the future net cash flows generated by the respective long-lived assets.\nAs of January 17, 2017, we closed the offering (the \u201cExchangeable Notes Offering\u201d) by our Luxembourg subsidiary, MagnaChip Semiconductor S.A., of $86.25 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.00% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2021 (the \u201cExchangeable Notes\u201d), reflecting the full exercise of the initial purchasers' option to purchase additional Exchangeable Notes. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the Exchangeable Notes Offering to repurchase 1,795,444 shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program, which was authorized by our board of directors on January 10, 2017, at an aggregate cost of $11.4 million.\nPreparing financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, the\n and mixed-signal process technologies such as high voltage complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS), non-volatile memory or bipolar-CMOS-DMOS (BCD). These customers typically serve the consumer, computing, communication, industrial, automotive and IoT applications. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our Foundry Services Group business represented 43.3% of our net sales and its gross profit was $82.6 million. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our Foundry Services Group business represented, on an adjusted basis after recasting, 51.6% and 43.5% of our net sales, respectively, and its gross profit was $101.8 million and $73.1 million, respectively, as adjusted for the segment change described above. \nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nbegan to pay a portion of the $4.2 million other termination benefits under the Program, which were paid in equal monthly installments over twelve months. We recorded the $4.2 million charge related to the full amount of these other termination benefits payable under the Program during the second quarter of 2016.\n Net Sales\nProduct Warranties\nOur principal capital requirements are to fund sales and marketing, invest in research and development and capital equipment, to make debt service payments and to fund working capital needs. We calculate working capital as current assets less current liabilities.\nWe are a party to arrangements for the water treatment facilities in Cheongju and Gumi, Korea, which include 5-year and 10-year service agreements, respectively.\nNet Sales by Geographic Region\n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \nIntangible Assets\nWithin our Standard Products Group, net sales are driven by design wins in which we are selected by an electronics original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or other potential customer to supply its demand for a particular product. A customer will often have more than one supplier designed in to multi-source components for a particular product line. Once we have design wins and the products enter into mass production, we often specify the pricing of a particular product for a set period of time, with periodic discussions and renegotiations of pricing with our customers. In any given period, our net sales depend heavily upon the end-market demand for the goods in which our products are used, the inventory levels maintained by our customers and in some cases, allocation of demand for components for a particular product among selected qualified suppliers.\nAll Other. All other gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $0.2 million. All other gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 was a negative $0.4 million mainly attributable to training and transition costs related to our closed 6-inch fab employees, which was partially offset by revenue from the disposal of waste materials.\nequivalents is less than $30.0 million at the end of a fiscal quarter unless a waiver is obtained from the counterparty. We cannot assure that any hedging technique we implement will be effective. If our hedging activities are not effective, changes in currency exchange rates may have a more significant impact on our results of operations.\nDemand for our products and services is driven by overall demand for communications, IoT, consumer, industrial and automotive products and can be adversely affected by periods of weak consumer and enterprise spending or by market share losses by our customers. In order to mitigate the impact of market volatility on our business, we are diversifying our portfolio of products, customers, and target applications. We also expect that new competitors will emerge in these markets that may place increased pressure on the pricing for our products and services. While we believe we are well positioned competitively to compete in these markets and against these new competitors as a result of our long operating history, existing manufacturing capacity and our\nindirectly through distributors. Selling expenses consist primarily of the personnel costs for the members of our direct sales force, a network of sales representatives and other costs of distribution. Personnel costs include base salary, benefits and incentive compensation.\nCash outflow used in investing activities totaled $33.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $35.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $2.1 million decrease in investing activities was attributable to a $5.7 million net decrease in hedge collateral, which was partially offset by a $3.6 million net increase in guarantee deposits.\nIn January 2018, as part of our ongoing portfolio optimization effort to realign business processes and streamline our organizational structure, we transferred a portion of our non-OLED display solutions business from our Standards Products Group to our Foundry Services Group. The transferred non-OLED display business has technical and business characteristics more closely aligned with our Foundry Services business than with our Standard Products business, which resided within our Display solutions business line primarily as a result of a long standing customer relationship established many years ago. We recast comparative segment financial information to conform to this current period change.\nIn accordance with ASC 815, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are cash flow hedges are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings in the period in which the hedged item affects earnings. Ineffective portions of a derivative instrument's change in fair value are immediately recognized in earnings. Derivative instruments that do not qualify, or cease to qualify, as hedges must be adjusted to fair value and the adjustments are recorded through net income (loss).\nBoth at the inception of a hedge and on an ongoing basis, a hedge must be expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in cash flows or fair value attributable to the underlying risk being hedged. If we determine that a derivative instrument is no longer highly effective as a hedge, it discontinues hedge accounting prospectively and future changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in current earnings. We assess hedge effectiveness at the end of each quarter.\nNet sales from our Display Solutions business line were $179.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a $77.6 million, or 30.2%, decrease from $256.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenue from our mobile OLED display driver ICs stemming from a timing mismatch between the drop-off in revenue from our existing OLED products and the introduction of new OLED products, and also from a prolonged slowdown in the China smartphone market. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenue from large display products mainly due to higher demand of source drivers for ultra high definition TVs. Net sales from our Power Solutions business line were $149.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a $18.4 million, or 14.0%, increase from $131.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in sales was primarily due to premium power products and MOSFETs for TV and mobile battery applications.\n Results by segment\nOur Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $84.3 million and $27.1 million, respectively. Our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $78.7 million and $28.9 million, respectively. Our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $40.7 million and $4.5 million, respectively.\n\n (a) For the year ended December 31, 2017, this adjustment eliminates the $16.6 million restructuring gain on sale of a building in connection with the closure of our 6-inch fab and the $0.4 million gain on sale of our sensor business. For the year ended December 31, 2016, this adjustment eliminates the $7.8 million restructuring gain on sale of machinery in connection with the closure of our 6-inch fab, net of $2.3 million training and transition costs related to our 6-inch fab employees. \nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, using the first in, first out method (\u201cFIFO\u201d). If net realizable value is less than cost at the balance sheet date, the carrying amount is reduced to the realizable value, and the difference is recognized as a loss on valuation of inventories within cost of sales. Inventory reserves are established when conditions indicate that the net realizable value is less than costs due to physical deterioration, obsolescence, changes in price levels, or other causes based on individual facts and circumstances. We evaluate the sufficiency of inventory reserves and take into consideration historical usage, expected demand, anticipated sales price, new product development schedules, the effect new products might have on the sale of existing products, product age and other factors. Reserves are also established for excess inventory based on our current inventory levels and projected demand and our ability to sell those specific products. Situations that could cause these inventory reserves include a decline in business and economic conditions, decline in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decline in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and consumer requirements, or failure to estimate end customer demand properly. A reduction of these inventory reserves may be recorded if previously reserved items are subsequently sold as a result of unexpected changes to certain aforementioned situations.\nWe recorded income tax expenses of $4.6 million and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in income tax expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to taxable income generated by our Korean subsidiary combined with its ability to utilize net operating carryforwards up to 70% of the taxable income, and a decrease in our uncertain tax positions that resulted in a reduction of income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our effective tax rate was 620.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to 1.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIncome Taxes. We record our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves using an asset and liability approach whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for differences in the financial reporting bases and tax bases of our assets and liabilities. We exercise significant management judgment in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities. We assess whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets existing at the period-end will be realized in future periods. In such assessment, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent results of operations. In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize the deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would adjust the valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.\n (f) This adjustment eliminates expenses in connection with the Audit Committee's independent investigation and related restatement and litigation, primarily comprised of legal, audit and consulting fees, and certain other expenses. For 2018, this adjustment eliminates the reversal of a $0.8 million accrual related to certain legal fees incurred in prior periods and reimbursed by insurers in the first quarter of 2018. For 2017, this adjustment includes the $3.0 million civil penalty imposed by the SEC and the $4.3 million of the additional tax assessment and associated penalties, primarily related to non-income-based VAT transactions in the Restatement periods, administrative fine and related legal fees. As these expenses meaningfully impacted our operating results and are not expected to represent an ongoing operating expense to us, we believe our operating performance results are more usefully compared if these expenses are excluded. \nInterest Expense. Interest expenses were $22.3 million and $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nIn September 2017, MagnaChip Semiconductor Ltd. (\u201cMSK\u201d), our Korean operating subsidiary, was notified that the Korean National Tax Service (the \u201cKNTS\u201d) would be examining the income- and non-income-based taxes of MSK for its 2012 to 2014 tax years. The KNTS had conducted its audit, primarily focusing on non-income-based value added tax (\u201cVAT\u201d) transactions associated with the periods with respect to which we previously restated our financial statements as a result of the independent investigation commenced by our Audit Committee in January 2014 (the \u201cRestatement\u201d).\nEvents associated with the closure of our 6-inch fab and reduction of workforce\nInventories\nAll Other. All other net sales were $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively.\nCash outflow used in operating activities totaled $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $9.4 million of cash inflow provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016. The net operating cash outflow for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflects our net income of $84.9 million and non-cash adjustments of a net negative $37.7 million, which mainly consisted of depreciation and amortization, provision for severance benefits and net foreign currency gain, and a net decrease in operating assets and liabilities of $67.5 million. The decrease in operating assets and liabilities was primarily related to an increase in accounts receivable as of December 31, 2017 due to a significant decrease in accounts receivable discounting during 2017 and the payments of statutory severance to the employees that resigned from our Company.\nNet sales in Europe for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased from $41.1 million to $47.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, or by $6.7 million, or 16.4%, primarily due to an increase in sales of certain battery charger related products from a global power management IC foundry customer, which was offset in part by lower demand from a customer serving the high-end smartphone market.\nNet sales were $679.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an $8.3 million, or 1.2%, decrease compared to $688.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily attributable to a net decrease in revenue from our Standard Products Group, which was offset in part by an increase in revenue from our Foundry Services Group as described below.\nOther Income (Expense)\nAs a result of the foregoing, net income increased by $114.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. As discussed above, the increase primarily resulted from a $36.5 million increase in operating income and an $80.9 million increase in foreign currency gain, which was partially offset by a $5.3 million increase in interest expense recorded for the Exchangeable Notes issued in January 2017.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncement\nSubstantially all of our contracts are one year or less in duration. The standard payment terms with customers are generally thirty to sixty days from the time of shipment, product delivery to the customer's location or customer acceptance, depending on the terms of the related arrangement.\nLabor Costs. A significant portion of our employees are located in Korea. Under Korean labor laws, most employees and certain executive officers with one or more years of service are entitled to severance benefits upon the termination of their employment based on their length of service and rate of pay. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 98% of our employees were eligible for severance benefits.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balance was $128.6 million, a $27.0 million increase, compared to $101.6 million as of December 31, 2016. The increase resulted from a $72.7 million of cash inflow provided by financing activities, which was partially offset by a $20.3 million of cash outflow used in operating activities and a $35.4 million of cash outflow used in investing activities.\nEarly Termination Charges. Termination related charges related to the reduction of workforce through the Headcount Reduction Plan for the year ended December 31, 2017 and the Program for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $13.4 million and $4.2 million, respectively.\n \u2022 Standard Products Group: Our Standard Products Group includes our Display Solutions and Power Solutions business lines. Our Display Solutions products include source, gate drivers, timing controllers, and one-chip integrated solutions that cover a wide range of panel displays used in ultra high definition (UHD), high definition (HD), light emitting diode (LED), 3D and OLED televisions public displays, notebooks, mobile communications, entertainment devices and automotive applications.

Our current portfolio of OLED solutions address a wide range of resolutions ranging from HD to Wide Quad High Definition (WQHD) for applications including smartphones, TVs, and other mobile devices. We believe we have a unique intellectual property portfolio and mixed-signal design and manufacturing expertise in the OLED industry. Our Power Solutions business line produces power management semiconductor products including discrete and integrated circuit solutions for power management in high-volume consumer applications. These products include metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs), insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs), AC-DC converters, DC-DC converters, LED drivers, switching regulators and linear regulators for a range of devices, including televisions, smartphones, mobile phones, desktop PCs, notebooks, tablet PCs, other consumer electronics, and industrial applications such as power suppliers, LED lighting, motor control and home appliances. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our Standard Products Group, which includes our Display Solutions and Power Solutions business lines, represented 56.7% of our net sales and its gross profit was $115.5 million. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our Standard Products Group business represented, on an adjusted basis after recasting, 48.4% and 56.4% of our net sales, respectively, and its gross profit was $85.9 million and $83.5 million, respectively, as adjusted for the segment change described above \nIncome Taxes\nOur Standards Products Group sells products manufactured based on our design. Our products are either standardized with an alternative use or we do not have an enforceable right to payment for the related manufacturing services completed to date. For those products, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of the product, which is generally upon product shipment, delivery at the customer's location or upon customer acceptance, depending on the terms of the arrangement.\nWe are subject to income- or non-income-based tax examinations by tax authorities of the US, Korea and multiple other foreign jurisdictions, where applicable, for all open tax years. Significant estimates and judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income- or non-income based taxes. Some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations. The ultimate amount of tax liability may be uncertain as a result. See \u201cItem 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 16. Income Taxes\u201d included elsewhere in this Report.\nYear ended December 31, 2018 compared to year ended December 31, 2017\nNet sales in the United States for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased from $35.1 million to $37.5 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, or by $2.4 million, or 6.8%, primarily due to an increase in sales of certain products from a global power management IC foundry customer.\nOverview\n (g) This adjustment eliminates expenses incurred for the secondary offering by the Selling Stockholders primarily in the third quarter of 2017. \nNet sales in the Asia Pacific for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased from $322.6 million to $380.6 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, or by $58.0 million, or 18.0%, primarily due to an increase in revenue related to increased sales to mobile OLED display driver ICs in connection with the introduction of new OLED smartphones. This increase was in part offset by a decrease in sales of certain products from a foundry customer serving the low- to mid-range mobile phone market, and a decrease in sales of certain low margin products from a global power management IC foundry customer.\nOur working capital balance as of December 31, 2017 was $192.1 million compared to $89.3 million as of December 31, 2016. The $102.9 million increase was primarily attributable to a $45.2 million increase in cash and cash equivalents, a $30.3 million increase in account receivables, a $16.0 million increase in inventory and a $16.5 million decrease in deposits received, which were partially offset by an $18.3 million decrease in restricted cash and a $14.4 million increase in account payables.\nVendor Rebates\n (i) This adjustment eliminates a $0.4 million legal expense related to the indemnification of a former employee. As the legal expense for the former employee is borne by us under a negotiated separation agreement, we do not believe that this charge is indicative of our core operating performance and has been excluded for comparative purposes. \nIssuance of Exchangeable Senior Notes and Stock Repurchase\n \u2022 we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is commonly requested and used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of the Company as an enterprise level performance measure that \nRestructuring and Other Charges(Gain), Net. Restructuring and other charges (gain), net of $17.0 million recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from a $16.6 million restructuring gain on the sale of the building related to the closure of our 6-inch fab and a $0.4 million gain on sale of our sensor business. Restructuring and other charges (gain), net of $6.5 million recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted from the sale of machinery related to the closure of our 6-inch fab, which was offset by $1.3 million of training and transition costs related to the employees at our closed 6-inch fab.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nEarly Termination Charges. Early termination charges of $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 were recorded for the termination benefits payable to the employees affected under our Headcount Reduction Plan.\nAs of April 29, 2016, 169 employees elected to resign under the terms of the Program. We paid approximately $8 million for severance benefits, which are required by law and had already been fully accrued in our financial statements, in a lump sum during the second quarter of 2016. Beginning in May 2016, we also\nWe account for transfers of financial assets under ASC 860, \u201cTransfers and Servicing,\u201d as either sales or financings. Transfers of financial assets that result in sales accounting are those in which (1) the transfer legally\n (1) Interest payments as well as $84.66 million aggregate principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes outstanding as of December 31, 2018, which bear interest at a rate of 5.0% per annum and are scheduled to mature in 2021 if not earlier converted. \nIn December 2018, we repurchased a principal amount of $0.5 million and $1.6 million of the 2021 Notes and the Exchangeable Notes, respectively. As a result, we recorded a $0.2 million net loss as early extinguishment loss on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nA substantial portion of our net foreign currency gain or loss is non-cash translation gain or loss associated with the intercompany long-term loans to our Korean subsidiary, which is denominated in US dollars, and is affected by changes in the exchange rate between the Korean won and the US dollar. As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding intercompany loan balance including accrued interest between our Korean subsidiary and our Dutch subsidiary was $666.6 million. Foreign currency translation gain or loss from intercompany balances was included in determining our consolidated net income since the intercompany balances were not considered long-term investments in nature because management intended to settle these intercompany balances at their respective maturity dates.\nNet Sales by Geographic Region\nIn January 2018, as part of our ongoing portfolio optimization effort to realign business processes and streamline our organizational structure, we transferred a portion of our non-OLED display solutions business\n (e) This adjustment eliminates the impact of gain or loss recognized in income on derivatives, which represents hedge ineffectiveness or derivatives value changes excluded from the risk being hedged. We enter into derivative transactions to mitigate foreign exchange risks. As our derivative transactions are limited to a certain portion of our expected cash flows denominated in US dollars, and we do not enter into derivative transactions for trading or speculative purposes, we do not believe that these charges or gains are indicative of our core operating performance. \nThe cash flows from derivative instruments receiving hedge accounting treatment are classified in the same categories as the hedged items in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n (g) This adjustment eliminates expenses incurred for the secondary offering by the Selling Stockholders primarily in the third quarter of 2017. \nForeign Currency Gain (Loss), Net. Net foreign currency loss for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $24.4 million compared to net foreign currency gain of $65.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net foreign currency loss for the year ended December 31, 2018 was due to the depreciation in value of the Korean won relative to the US dollar during the period. The net foreign currency gain for the year ended December 31, 2017 was due to the appreciation in value of the Korean won relative to the US dollar during the period.\nreported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and the related disclosures in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\n \u2022 for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget; \nTotal gross profit was $187.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $156.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a $31.7 million, or 20.3%, increase. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased to 27.6% compared to 22.7% for the year ended December 31,\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $72.6 million, or 9.7% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $81.8 million, or 12.0%\n \u2022 other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.  Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our US GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA only supplementally.\n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the costs of holding certain assets and liabilities in foreign currencies; and \n (5) Includes license agreements, funding obligations for the accrued severance benefits and other contractual obligations.  The indentures relating to the Exchangeable Notes and the 2021 Notes contain covenants as detailed in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 10. Long-term Borrowings\u201d in this Report. Those covenants are subject to a number of exceptions and qualifications. Certain of those restrictive covenants will terminate if the Exchangeable Notes or the 2021 Notes are rated investment grade at any time.\n \u2022 we use Adjusted Net Income (Loss) in communications with our Board of Directors concerning our consolidated financial performance without the impact of non-cash expenses and the other items as we discussed below since we believe that it is a more consistent measure of our core operating results from period to period; and \nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under US GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nStandard Products Group. Gross profit from our Standard Products Group segment was $115.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a $29.6 million, or 34.4%, increase from $85.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased to 27.1% compared to 26.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in both gross profit and gross profit margin was primarily attributable to a favorable product mix from an increase in sales of mobile OLED display driver ICs.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, our cash flows from operations and our financing activities. Our ability to manage cash and cash equivalents may be limited, as our primary cash flows are dictated by the terms of our sales and supply agreements, contractual obligations, debt instruments and legal and regulatory requirements. From time to time, we may sell accounts receivable to third parties under factoring agreements or engage in accounts receivable discounting to facilitate the collection of cash. For a description of our factoring arrangements and accounts receivable discounting, please see \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 3. Accounts Receivable\u201d included elsewhere in this Report. In addition, from time to time, we may make payments to our vendors on extended terms with their consent. As of December 31, 2018, we do not have any accounts payable on extended terms or payment deferment with our vendors.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain information related to our operations, expressed in US dollars and as a percentage of our net sales:\nIn December 2014, we announced that our Board of Directors had adopted a plan to close our 6-inch fab. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we received an $8.2 million deposit for sale of machinery in conjunction with the planned closure of our 6-inch fab. According to this plan, the 6-inch fab was closed on February 29, 2016. During the first quarter of 2016, we completed all procedures necessary to sell all machineries in our closed 6-inch fab and recognized a $7.8 million restructuring gain from the related deposit of $8.2 million, net of certain direct selling costs. On April 4, 2016, we commenced a voluntary resignation program (the \u201cProgram\u201d), which was available to certain manufacturing employees, including our 6-inch fab employees, through April 29, 2016.\nCash inflow generated by financing activities totaled $72.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $71.0 million increase was primarily was attributable to $80.3 million of net proceeds received from the issuance of the Exchangeable Notes and a $2.0 million increase in proceeds received from exercised stock options, which was partly offset by the payment of $11.4 million for the repurchase of 1,795,444 shares of our common stock in January 2017 pursuant to our stock repurchase plan.\nSegments\nisolates the transferred assets from the transferor, (2) the transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the transferred assets and no condition both constrains the transferee's right to pledge or exchange the assets and provides more than a trivial benefit to the transferor and (3) the transferor does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets. If the transfer does not meet these criteria, the transfer is accounted for as a financing. Financial assets that are treated as sales are removed from our accounts with any realized gain or loss reflected in earnings during the period of sale.\n Results by segment\nWe currently believe that we will have sufficient cash reserves from cash on hand and expected cash from operations to fund our operations as well as capital expenditures for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Long-Term Borrowings, Net. In December 2018, we repurchased a principal amount of $0.5 million and $1.6 million of the 2021 Notes and the Exchangeable Notes, respectively. In connection with these repurchases, we recognized a $0.2 million of net loss for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRecent Developments\nAll Other. All other net sales remained constant at $0.2 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nIn January 2014, our Audit Committee commenced an independent investigation that resulted in the Restatement. In March, 2014, we voluntarily reported to the SEC that our Audit Committee had determined that we incorrectly recognized revenue on certain transactions and as a result would restate our financial statements, and that our Audit Committee had commenced an independent investigation.\n \u2022 we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful for investors, among other reasons, to assess the Company's period-to-period core operating performance and to understand and assess the manner in which management analyzes operating performance. \nSee the footnotes to the table below for further information regarding these items. We present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our performance because:\nSee Note 1 \u201cBusiness, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report, for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nIn contrast to completely fabless semiconductor companies, our internal manufacturing capacity provides us with greater control over manufacturing costs and the ability to implement process and production improvements for our internally manufactured products, which can favorably impact gross profit margins. Our internal manufacturing capacity also allows for better control over delivery schedules, improved consistency over product quality and reliability and improved ability to protect intellectual property from misappropriation on these products. However, having internal manufacturing capacity exposes us to the risk of under-utilization of manufacturing capacity that results in lower gross profit margins, particularly during downturns in the semiconductor industry.\n (b) This adjustment eliminates the charges related to the reduction of workforce through the Headcount Reduction Plan in the first half of 2017 and the Program in the second quarter of 2016. As these termination related charges are recorded as a result of implementing the company-wide headcount reduction and are not expected to represent ongoing operating expenses to us, we believe our operating performance results are more usefully compared if these expenses are excluded. ", "item_7_text": "In our previous public filings, we had used a term \u201cactive matrix organic light emitting diodes (AMOLED)\u201d that described a display technology used in certain display driver ICs that we had designed and manufactured in our internal and external foundries. Beginning in the second quarter of 2017, we have used the term \u201cOLED\u201d instead of the term \u201cAMOLED\u201d in our public filings in order to be consistent with commonly accepted industry naming practices for this product category. There is no change to the products that we previously referred to as AMOLED display driver ICs.\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 815, which requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value.\nAs prescribed in ASC 330, \u201cInventory,\u201d once a reserve is established for a particular item based on our assessment as described above, it is maintained until the related item is sold or scrapped as a new cost basis has been established that cannot subsequently be marked up. In addition, the cost of inventories is determined based on the normal capacity of each fabrication facility. In case the capacity utilization is lower than a certain level that management believes to be normal, the fixed overhead costs per production unit which exceed those under normal capacity are charged to cost of sales rather than capitalized as inventories.\n Net sales in Korea for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased from $219.6 million to $279.9 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, or by $60.3 million, or 27.4%, primarily due to higher demand of large display applications for TVs and our foundry services from certain customers serving the mid-range smartphone and consumer electronics markets. Higher sales of premium power products and MOSFETs also had a favorable impact.\nfrom our Standards Products Group to our Foundry Services Group. The transferred non-OLED display business has technical and business characteristics more closely aligned with our Foundry Services business than with our Standard Products business, which resided within our Display solutions business line primarily as a result of a long standing customer relationship established in the past. The transferred non-OLED display business represented $33.0 million of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018. The corresponding non-OLED display business represented $30.3 million and $25.2 million of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n Net sales in Korea for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased from $279.9 million to $282.5 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, or by $2.6 million, or 0.9%, primarily due to higher sales of premium power product and an increase in revenue related to the introduction of new OLED display driver ICs, which was offset in part by a strategic reduction of low margin LCD business.\nSince 2007, we have designed and manufactured organic light emitting diodes (OLED) display driver ICs in our internal manufacturing facilities. As we expanded our design capabilities to products that require lower geometries unavailable at our existing manufacturing facilities, we began outsourcing manufacturing of certain OLED display driver ICs to an external foundry from the second half of 2015. This additional source of manufacturing is an increasingly important part of our supply chain management. By outsourcing manufacturing of advanced OLED products to external foundries, we are able to dynamically adapt to the changing customer requirements and address growing markets without substantial capital investments by us. Both at the internal manufacturing facilities and external foundries, we apply our unique OLED process patents as well as other intellectual property, proprietary process design kits and custom design-flow methodologies.\nIncome Tax Expenses\n \u2022 to evaluate the effectiveness of our enterprise level business strategies; \nStandard Products Group. Net sales from our Standard Products Group segment were $329.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a $59.2 million, or 15.2%, decrease compared to $388.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This substantial decrease was primarily due to a significant decrease in revenue related to our Display Solutions business line, partially offset by increase in revenue related to our Power Solutions business line as described below.\nForeign Currency Gain or Loss. Foreign currency translation gains or losses on transactions by us or our subsidiaries in a currency other than our or our subsidiaries' functional currency are included in our statements of operations as a component of other income (expense). A substantial portion of this net foreign currency gain or loss relates to non-cash translation gain or loss related to the principal balance of intercompany balances at our Korean subsidiary that are denominated in US dollars. This gain or loss results from fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Korean won and US dollar.\nWe follow US GAAP guidance on uncertain tax positions. Our unrecognized tax benefits totaled $0.4 million as of December 31, 2018. These unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the above table because we cannot estimate the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities.\nWe, from time to time, entered into arrangements whereby rebates are obtained from vendors when we achieve certain levels of purchases. The vendor rebates are computed at an agreed upon amount or percentage of\nFoundry Services Group. Net sales from our Foundry Services Group segment were $350.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a $51.3 million, or 17.1%, increase compared to net sales of $299.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to higher demand for our foundry services from certain customers serving the mid-range smartphone and consumer electronics markets and higher sales of certain products from a global power management IC foundry customer. These increases were partially offset by a net decrease in demand of our foundry services from a customer serving the high-end smartphone market.\nof net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease of $9.1 million, or 11.2%, was primarily attributable to a $6.7 million decrease in professional fees, which were mainly comprised of legal and consulting services and a $4.2 million charge related to an additional tax assessment and associated penalties and an administrative fine as a result of the tax audit conducted by the KNTS which concluded in the fourth quarter of 2017. These decreases were offset in part by an increase in employee compensation, including issuance of equity-based compensation.\nWe use the terms Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) throughout this Report. Adjusted EBITDA, as we define it, is a non-US GAAP measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated as EBITDA (as defined below), adjusted to exclude (i) restructuring and other gain, net, (ii) early termination charges, (iii) equity-based compensation expense, (iv) foreign currency loss (gain), net, (v) derivative valuation loss (gain), net, (vi) restatement related expenses (gain), (vii) secondary offering expense, (viii) loss on early extinguishment of long-term borrowings, net and (ix) other indemnification costs and reimbursement. EBITDA for the periods indicated is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, net, income tax expenses, and depreciation and amortization.\nNet Income\nWe report our financial results in two operating segments: Foundry Services Group and Standard Products Group. We identified these segments based on how we allocate resources and assess our performance.\nOur products and services require investments in capital equipment. Analog and mixed-signal manufacturing facilities and processes are typically distinguished by the design and process implementation expertise rather than the use of the most advanced equipment. Many of these processes also tend to migrate more slowly to smaller geometries due to technological barriers and increased costs. For example, some of our products use high-voltage technology that requires larger geometries and that may not migrate to smaller geometries for several years, if at all. As a result, our manufacturing base and strategy do not require substantial investment in leading edge process equipment for those products, allowing us to utilize our facilities and equipment over an extended period of time with moderate required capital investments. In addition, we are less likely to experience significant industry overcapacity, which can cause product prices to decline significantly. In general, we seek to invest in manufacturing capacity that can be used for multiple high-value applications over an extended period of time. In addition, we outsource manufacturing of those products which do require advanced technology and 12-inch wafer capacity. We believe this capital investment strategy enables us to optimize our capital investments and facilitates more diversified product and service offerings.\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d (\u201cASC 740\u201d). ASC 740 requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in a company's financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when it is necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Income tax expense is the tax payable for the period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nWe are in a period of weaker demand from our foundry customers in part as a result of recent softening global market conditions, including macroeconomic uncertainties. This, together with significantly lower than expected utilization, among other factors will adversely impact our Foundry Services Group gross margin and other operating results, and such impact likely will be material. We are also currently evaluating a number of options to optimize our foundry operations and expense structure with an intent toward maximizing shareholder value.\nAll Other. All other gross profit was $0.04 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $132.4 million, a $3.9 million increase, compared to $128.6 million as of December 31, 2017. The increase resulted from a $39.2 million of cash inflow provided by operating activities and a $1.3 million of cash inflow provided by financing activities, which was partially offset by a $33.3 million of cash outflow used in investing activities.\nCash outflow used in investing activities totaled $35.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to cash inflow provided by investing activities totaled $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $36.4 million increase was attributable to a $16.4 million decrease in proceeds from disposal of plant, property and equipment, a $13.9 million net increase in capital expenditures and a $7.0 million net increase in hedge collateral, which was partially offset by a $1.0 million net decrease in guarantee deposits.\nOur Foundry Services Group provides specialty analog and mixed-signal foundry services mainly for fabless and IDM semiconductor companies that primarily serve communications, IoT, consumer, industrial and automotive applications. Our Standard Products Group includes our Display Solutions and Power Solutions business lines. Our Display Solutions products provide flat panel display solutions to major suppliers of large and small rigid and flexible panel displays, and mobile, automotive applications and home appliances. Our Power Solutions products include discrete and integrated circuit solutions for power management in communications, consumer, computing and industrial applications.\nNet Income\nBeginning in July 2018, we have contributed a certain percentage of severance benefits, accrued for eligible employees for their services beginning January 1, 2018, to certain severance insurance deposit accounts. These accounts consist of time deposits and other guaranteed principal and interest, and are maintained at insurance companies, banks or security companies for the benefit of employees. We deduct the contributions made to these severance insurance deposit accounts from our accrued severance benefits. As of December 31, 2018, our accrued severance benefits totaled $146.0 million and cumulative contributions to these severance insurance deposit accounts amounted to $2.5 million. Our related cash payments for future contributions are $2.7 million and $3.6 million for 2019 and 2020, respectively, to the extent that our obligations are contractual, fixed and reasonably estimable.\n (h) This adjustment eliminates expenses related to the repurchase of a portion of the 2021 Notes and the Exchangeable Notes in December 2018. \nFoundry Services Group. Net sales from our Foundry Services Group segment were $325.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a $25.1 million, or 7.2%, decrease compared to net sales of $350.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in demand of low margin product sales from a global power management IC foundry customer and a decrease in demand from a customer serving the low- to mid-range mobile phone market. This decrease was offset in part by an increase in sales of certain battery charger related products from a global power management IC foundry customer.\nWe provide warranty provisions under which customers can return defective products. We also provide allowances for additional products that may have to be provided free of charge to compensate customers for not meeting previously agreed upon yield criteria, which we refer to as the low yield compensation reserve. We estimate the costs related to warranty claims, repair or replacements and low yield compensation reserves, and record them as components of cost of sales.\nResults of Operations-Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss)\nWe make an ongoing assessment regarding the realization of US and non-US deferred tax assets. The valuation allowances at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were primarily attributable to deferred tax assets for the uncertainty in taxable income at our Korean subsidiary for which we have recorded a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets, net of its deferred tax liabilities, and against certain of our foreign subsidiaries' deferred tax assets pertaining to their related tax loss carry-forwards and tax credits that are not anticipated to generate a tax benefit.\nAs a result of the foregoing, operating income increased by an $8.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. As discussed above, the increase in operating income resulted from a $10.2 million increase in gross profit, a $9.1 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses and a $13.4 million decrease in early termination charges, which were partially offset by a $17.0 million decrease in restructuring and other gain and a $7.5 million increase in research development expenses.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited consolidated interim financial statements, together in each case with the related notes, included elsewhere in this Report. This discussion and analysis contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Report.\nFoundry Services Group. Gross profit from our Foundry Services Group segment was $101.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a $28.7 million, or 39.3%, increase compared to $73.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased to 29.0% compared to 24.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was mainly attributable to a better product mix, a higher utilization rate and a favorable impact from reduction in headcount, which was offset in part primarily by an increase in wafer price and employee costs associated with unused vacation.\nIn December 2017, the KNTS concluded that no criminal charges would be brought against any current officers or directors of MSK or MSK itself. As a result, we took a charge of $4.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to this additional tax assessment and associated penalties and administrative fine. We recorded the $0.5 million related to employee withholding amounts as other receivables in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017, as we expected to obtain reimbursement of the applicable amounts from those employees. Of the $0.5 million, we have collected $0.1 million and established an allowance of $0.4 million and recorded it as selling, general and administrative expense for the three months ended September 30, 2018.\nThe gross amount of inventory reserves charged to cost of sales totaled $6.0 million, $4.8 million and $7.6 million in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The new cost base related to the sale of inventory that was previously written down totaled $1.8 million, $3.8 million and $5.0 million in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nResearch and Development. The rapid technological change and product obsolescence that characterize our industry require us to make continuous investments in research and development. Product development time frames vary but, in general, we incur research and development costs one to two years before generating sales from the associated new products. These expenses include personnel costs for members of our engineering workforce, cost of photomasks, silicon wafers and other non-recurring engineering charges related to product design. Additionally, we develop base line process technology through experimentation and through the design and use of characterization wafers that help achieve commercially feasible yields for new products. The majority of research and development expenses of our Foundry Services Group are for process development that serves as a common technology platform for all of our product lines. For our Standard Products Group, the majority of research and development expenses are material-related costs for OLED display driver IC product development involving fine processes.\nIn addition, we offer sales returns (other than those that relate to defective products under warranty), cash discounts for early payments, volume discounts and certain allowances to our customers, including our distributors. We record reserves for those returns, discounts and allowances as a deduction from sales, based on historical experience and other quantitative and qualitative factors.\nOur working capital balance as of December 31, 2018 was $220.1 million compared to $192.1 million as of December 31, 2017. The $28.0 million increase was primarily attributable to a $38.2 million increase in unbilled accounts receivable, which was a new item created in our balance sheet beginning January 1, 2018 to conform with the new revenue recognition standard and represented our contractual right to consideration for manufacturing work performed on a customer contract or an individual purchase order basis, which had not been invoiced to the customer. This increase was offset in part by a $12.0 million decrease in account receivables.\n2016. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was due to both our Foundry Services Group and Standard Products Group segments as described below.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nworldwide customer base, if we are not effective in competing in these markets our operating results may be adversely affected.\nIncome Tax Expenses (Benefits)\nOperating Expenses\nWithin our Foundry Services Group, net sales are driven by customers' decisions on which manufacturing services provider to use for a particular product. Most of our Foundry Services Group customers are fabless, while some are IDM customers. A customer will often have more than one supplier of manufacturing services. In any given period, our net sales depend heavily upon the end-market demand for the goods in which the products we manufacture for customers are used, the inventory levels maintained by our customers and in some cases, allocation of demand for manufacturing services among selected qualified suppliers.\nPrior to the adoption of the new revenue standard effective on January 1, 2018, we had historically recognized revenue when risk and reward of ownership pass to the customer either upon shipment, upon product delivery at the customer's location or upon customer acceptance, depending on the terms of the arrangement. After the adoption of the new revenue standard effective on January 1, 2018, we recognize revenue over time for those foundry products without alternative use where we have an enforceable right to payment for the related foundry services completed to date. As we adopted the new revenue standard under the modified retrospective method, we have not changed the comparative information in our interim consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. Such comparative information continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for that period. See \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 1-Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies-Basis of Presentation and Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in this Report for further discussion. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we sold products to 370 and 343 customers, respectively, and our net sales to our ten largest customers represented 61% and 57% of our net sales, respectively. We have a combined production capacity of approximately 113,000 semiconductor wafers per month. We believe our large-scale, cost-effective fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly adjust our production levels to meet shifts in demand by our end customers.\n \u2022 Adjusted Net Income (Loss) does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of issuing equity-based compensation to our management team and employees; \nInterest Expense. Our interest expense was incurred primarily under our 2021 Notes and our Exchangeable Notes.\n (c) This adjustment eliminates the impact of non-cash equity-based compensation expenses. Although we expect to incur non-cash equity-based compensation expenses in the future, these expenses do not generally require cash settlement, and, therefore, are not used by us to assess the profitability of our operations. We believe that analysts and investors will find it helpful to review our operating performance without the effects of these non-cash expenses as supplemental information. \nTo maintain and increase our profitability, we must accurately forecast trends in demand for electronics devices that incorporate semiconductor products we produce. We must understand our customers' needs as well as the likely end market trends and demand in the markets they serve. We must balance the likely manufacturing utilization demand of our product businesses and foundry business to optimize our capacity utilization. We must also invest in relevant research and development activities and manufacturing capacity and purchase necessary materials on a timely basis to meet our customers' demand while maintaining our target margins and cash flow.\nOperating Income\nOther Income (Expense)\nOn December 10, 2015, we entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with the plaintiffs' representatives to settle the Class Action Litigation, as defined and detailed in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in this Report, for an aggregate settlement payment of $23.5 million. This settlement payment was fully funded by insurance proceeds that were received in the first quarter of 2016 and disbursed from the escrow account, previously recorded as restricted cash, in the third quarter of 2016.\nCash inflow provided by operating activities totaled $39.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $20.3 million of cash outflow used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net operating cash inflow for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflects our net loss of $3.9 million, as adjusted favorably by $86.3 million, which mainly consisted of depreciation and amortization, provision for severance benefits and net foreign currency loss, and net unfavorable impact of $43.1 million from changes of operating assets and liabilities.\nRevenue Recognition\n (a) For the year ended December 31, 2017, this adjustment eliminates the $16.6 million restructuring gain on sale of a building in connection with the closure of our 6-inch fab and the $0.4 million gain on sale of our sensor business. For the year ended December 31, 2016, this adjustment eliminates the $7.8 million restructuring gain on sale of machinery in connection with the closure of our 6-inch fab, net of $2.3 million training and transition costs related to our 6-inch fab employees. \nWe record, in other current liabilities, warranty liabilities for the estimated costs that may be incurred under our basic limited warranty. The standard limited warranty period is one to two years for the majority of products. This warranty covers defective products, and related liabilities are accrued when product revenues are recognized. Factors that affect our warranty liabilities include historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and repair or replacement costs per claim to satisfy our warranty obligation. We also record, in other current liabilities, low yield compensation reserves for our estimated costs for products that may have to be provided free of charge to compensate customers for not meeting previously agreed upon yield criteria. Factors that affect our low yield compensation reserves include historical and anticipated rates of claims for not meeting previously agreed upon yield criteria. We periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and low yield compensation reserves, and adjust our estimates when necessary.\nFoundry Services Group. Gross profit from our Foundry Services Group segment was $82.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a $19.2 million, or 18.9%, decrease compared to $101.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased to 25.4% compared to 29.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was mainly attributable to a lower utilization rate, which was affected in part by a softening global market conditions, including macroeconomic uncertainties, and a strategic reduction of low margin LCD business. This decrease was also attributable to an unfavorable product mix and an increase in raw wafer prices.\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under US GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n (d) This adjustment mainly eliminates the impact of non-cash foreign currency translation associated with intercompany debt obligations and foreign currency denominated receivables and payables, as well as the cash impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses on collection of such receivables and payment of such payables. Although we expect to incur foreign currency translation gains or losses in the future, we believe that analysts and investors will find it helpful to review our operating performance without the effects of these primarily non-cash gains or losses, which we cannot control. Additionally, we believe the isolation of this adjustment provides investors with enhanced comparability to prior and future periods of our operating performance results. \nRepurchase of Long-term Borrowings\nDutch subsidiary was $677.3 million. Foreign currency translation gain or loss from intercompany balances was included in determining our consolidated net income since the intercompany balances were not considered long-term investments in nature because management intended to settle these intercompany balances at their respective maturity dates.\nIn March 2017, we sold our sensor product business, which was included in and reported as part of the Display Solutions line of our Standard Products Group, to a third party for proceeds of $1.3 million, in an effort to improving our overall profitability. We recorded a $0.4 million gain from this sale after deducting the book values of certain assets transferred to the buyer.\nA portion of our sales are made through distributors for which we apply the same revenue recognition guidance described above. We defer the recognition of revenue when a distributor receives consideration from the customers prior to the performance obligation being fulfilled. These amounts are classified as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets.\nOn May 1, 2017, the SEC announced that it had reached a final settlement with us, resolving the SEC's investigation, as detailed in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in this Report. In connection therewith, we have consented, without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, to the entry of an administrative order by the SEC directing that we cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of certain provisions of the federal securities laws and related SEC regulations. The SEC's administrative order was entered on May 1, 2017. The SEC imposed a monetary penalty of $3.0 million on us. In the three months ended March 31, 2017, we established a reserve in that amount for the potential settlement of this matter and recorded it as selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The reserved monetary penalty of $3.0 million was paid to the SEC during the three months ended June 30, 2017.\n (d) This adjustment mainly eliminates the impact of non-cash foreign currency translation associated with intercompany debt obligations and foreign currency denominated receivables and payables, as well as the cash impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses on collection of such receivables and payment of such payables. Although we expect to incur foreign currency translation gains or losses in the future, we believe that analysts and investors will find it helpful to review our operating performance without the effects of these primarily non-cash gains or losses, which we cannot control. Additionally, we believe the isolation of this adjustment provides investors with enhanced comparability to prior and future periods of our operating performance results. \nImpact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates on Reported Results of Operations. Historically, a portion of our revenues and greater than the majority of our operating expenses and costs of sales have been denominated in non-US currencies, principally the Korean won, and we expect that this will remain true in the future. Because we report our results of operations in US dollars converted from our non-US revenues and expenses based on monthly average exchange rates, changes in the exchange rate between the Korean won and the US dollar could materially impact our reported results of operations and distort period to period comparisons. In particular, because of the difference in the amount of our consolidated revenues and expenses that are in US dollars relative to Korean won, depreciation in the US dollar relative to the Korean won could result in a material increase in reported costs relative to revenues, and therefore could cause our profit margins and operating income (loss) to appear to decline materially, particularly relative to prior periods. The converse is true if the US dollar were to appreciate relative to the Korean won. Moreover, our foreign currency gain or loss would be affected by changes in the exchange rate between the Korean won and the US dollar as a substantial portion of non-cash translation gain or loss is associated with the intercompany long-term loans to our Korean subsidiary, which is denominated in US dollars. As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding intercompany loan balance including accrued interest between our Korean subsidiary and our Dutch subsidiary was $666.6 million. This amount included an intercompany loan of $75.0 million executed during the three months ended March 31, 2017, which was used to transfer a portion of the net proceeds from the offering of the Exchangeable Notes from our Luxembourg subsidiary to our Dutch subsidiary, and then to our Korean subsidiary. As a result of such foreign currency fluctuations, it could be more difficult to detect underlying trends in our business and results of operations. In addition, to the extent that fluctuations in currency exchange rates cause our results of operations to differ from our expectations or the expectations of our investors, the trading price of our stock could be adversely affected.\nOn February 14, 2019, we announced that we have undertaken a strategic evaluation of our Foundry Services Group business and fabrication facility located in Cheongju (\u201cFab 4\u201d), the larger of our two 8\u201d manufacturing facilities. Fab 4 is an analog and mixed signal fab that produces approximately 73% of our total capacity, and is used primarily to meet wafer demand from customers of our Foundry Services Group that rely on outside suppliers. The strategic evaluation is expected to include a range of possible options, including, but not limited to, joint ventures, strategic partnerships as well as M&A possibilities. We have engaged J.P. Morgan Securities LLC as our financial advisor to assist in the evaluation. It is possible that the announced strategic evaluation of our Foundry Services Group business and Fab 4 could adversely impact foundry loadings and Company margins.\nWe recognize revenue when it satisfies the performance obligation of transferring control over a product or service to a customer. Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer, which consideration is paid in exchange for a product or service.\nDepreciation Expense. We periodically evaluate the carrying values of long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, as well as the related depreciation periods. We depreciated our property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of our assets. Depreciation rates vary from 30-40 years on buildings to 5 to 12 years for certain equipment and assets. Our evaluation of carrying values is based on various analyses including cash flow and profitability projections. If our projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying values of the related long-lived assets, the carrying value of the assets is impaired and will be reduced, with the reduction charged to expense so that the carrying value is equal to fair value.\n \u2022 other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted Net Income (Loss) differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.  Because of these limitations, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) should not be considered as a measure of profitability of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our US GAAP results and using Adjusted Net Income (Loss) only supplementally.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses consist of the costs of various corporate operations, including finance, legal, human resources and other administrative functions. These expenses primarily consist of payroll-related expenses, consulting and other professional fees and office facility-related expenses.\nWe recorded income tax expenses of $1.2 million and $3.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in income tax expenses in 2017 was primarily attributable to our revised tax positions in connection with our Korean subsidiary. The effective tax rate was 1.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to negative for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe semiconductor markets in which we participate are highly competitive. The prices of our products tend to decrease regularly over their useful lives, and such price decreases can be significant as new generations of products are introduced by us or our competitors. We strive to offset the impact of declining selling prices for existing products through cost reductions and the introduction of new products that command selling prices above the average selling price of our existing products. In addition, we seek to manage our inventories and manufacturing capacity so as to mitigate the risk of losses from product obsolescence.\nNotes and $3.7 million of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options, which was partly offset by the payment of $11.4 million for the repurchase of 1,795,444 shares of our common stock in January 2017 pursuant to our stock repurchase plan.\n \u2022 we believe that Adjusted EBITDA, by eliminating the impact of a number of items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core ongoing operating performance, provides a more comparable measure of our operating performance from period-to-period and may be a better indicator of future performance; \n (f) This adjustment eliminates expenses in connection with the Audit Committee's independent investigation and related restatement and litigation, primarily comprised of legal, audit and consulting fees, and certain \nOn June 29, 2018, we entered into an arrangement whereby we acquired a water treatment facility to support our fabrication facility in Gumi, Korea from SK hynix for $4.2 million, and sold it for $4.2 million to a third party management company that we have engaged to run the facility for a 10-year term. This arrangement is accounted for as a financing due to our Korean subsidiary's continuing involvement with the facility. As a result, on the acquisition date, we recorded the water treatment facility of $4.2 million as property, plant and equipment, net, which is depreciated over its useful life. We also recorded the related liabilities of $0.6 million as other current liabilities and $3.6 million as other non-current liabilities, which relates to the financing and service portion of the arrangement and is amortized using the effective interest method over the contract period.\nAs of February 22, 2017, our Board of Directors approved the implementation of a headcount reduction plan (the \u201cHeadcount Reduction Plan\u201d). As of June 30, 2017, 352 employees elected to resign from the Company during the period in which the Headcount Reduction Plan was offered. The Headcount Reduction Plan is expected to result in estimated annual cost savings of approximately $24 million. The total cash cost of approximately $31 million has been fully paid. We recorded in our consolidated statement of operations $11.1 million and $2.3 million termination related charges as \u201cearly termination charges\u201d for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, respectively. The remaining total cost relates to statutory severance benefits, which are required by law and had already been fully accrued in our financial statements.\n\nA substantial portion of our net foreign currency gain or loss is non-cash translation gain or loss associated with the intercompany long-term loans to our Korean subsidiary, which is denominated in US dollars, and is affected by changes in the exchange rate between the Korean won and the US dollar. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding intercompany loan balance including accrued interest between our Korean subsidiary and our\n\nUnder the provisions of ASC 815, we may designate a derivative instrument as hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are attributable to a particular risk (a \u201ccash flow hedge\u201d) or hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability (a \u201cfair value hedge\u201d). Special accounting for qualifying hedges allows the effective portion of a derivative instrument's gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the consolidated statements of operations and requires that a company formally document, designate and assess the effectiveness of the transactions that receive hedge accounting treatment.\n (4) Includes future payments for water treatment services for our fabrication facilities in Korea based on the contractual terms. \nWe encourage you to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons we consider them appropriate. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure defined in accordance with US GAAP and should not be construed as an alternative to income from continuing operations, cash flows from operating activities or net income, as determined in accordance with US GAAP. A reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:\n \u2022 in communications with our Board of Directors concerning our consolidated financial performance; and \nCapital Expenditures. We primarily invest in manufacturing equipment, software design tools and other tangible assets mainly for fabrication facility maintenance, capacity expansion and technology improvement. Capacity expansions and technology improvements typically occur in anticipation of increases in demand. We typically pay for capital expenditures in partial installments with portions due on order, delivery and final acceptance. Our capital expenditures mainly include our payments for the purchase of property, plant and equipment.\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA in a number of ways, including:\nOperating Income (Loss)\nWe make an ongoing assessment regarding the realization of US and non-US deferred tax assets. The valuation allowances at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were primarily attributable to deferred tax assets for the uncertainty in taxable income at our Korean subsidiary for which we have recorded a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets, net of its deferred tax liabilities, and against certain of our foreign subsidiaries' deferred tax assets pertaining to their related tax loss carry-forwards and tax credits that are not anticipated to generate a tax benefit.\n (i) This adjustment eliminates a $0.4 million legal expense related to the indemnification of a former employee. As the legal expense for the former employee is borne by us under a negotiated separation agreement, we do not believe that this charge is indicative of our core operating performance and has been excluded for comparative purposes. \nExplanation and Reconciliation of Non-US GAAP Measures\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses were $70.5 million, or 10.4% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $72.2 million, or 10.5% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease of $1.7 million, or 2.3%, was primarily attributable to a decrease in salary expense as a result of our headcount reduction of non-key R&D personnel.\n eliminates the effects of financing, income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending, as well as other one time or recurring items described above; and \n \u2022 Foundry Services Group: Our Foundry Services Group provides specialty analog and mixed-signal foundry services to fabless semiconductor companies and IDMs that serve communications, IoT, consumer, industrial and automotive applications. We manufacture wafers based on our customers' product designs. We do not market these products directly to end customers but rather supply manufactured wafers and products to our customers to market to their end customers. We offer approximately 508 process flows to our foundry services customers. We also often partner with key customers to jointly develop or customize specialized processes that enable our customers to improve their products and allow us to develop unique manufacturing expertise. Our foundry services target customers who require differentiated, specialty analog \nResults of Operations-Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nOur Foundry Services Group manufactures products, which we refer to as foundry products, based on customers' specific product designs. We recognize revenue over time for foundry products that do not have an alternative use when we have an enforceable right to payment. Revenue recognized over time is in proportion of wafer manufacturing costs incurred relative to total estimated costs for completion. However, in certain circumstances, pursuant to a customer contract or an individual purchase order, we may not have an enforceable right to payment for services performed at a given time. In this situation, we recognize revenue at the time when a customer obtains control of the product, which is generally upon product shipment, delivery at the customer's location or upon customer acceptance, depending on the terms of the arrangement.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\n (e) This adjustment eliminates the impact of gain or loss recognized in income on derivatives, which represents hedge ineffectiveness or derivatives value changes excluded from the risk being hedged. We enter into derivative transactions to mitigate foreign exchange risks. As our derivative transactions are limited to a certain portion of our expected cash flows denominated in US dollars, and we do not enter into derivative transactions for trading or speculative purposes, we do not believe that these charges or gains are indicative of our core operating performance. \nWe recognize and measure uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return utilizing a two-step process. In the first step, recognition, we determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step addresses measurement of a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not criteria. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of greater than 50 percent of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\nOur success going forward will depend upon our ability to adapt to future challenges such as the emergence of new competitors for our products and services or the consolidation of current competitors. Additionally, we must innovate to remain ahead of, or at least rapidly adapt to, technological breakthroughs that may lead to a significant change in the technology necessary to deliver our products and services. We believe that our established relationships and close collaboration with leading customers enhance our awareness of new product opportunities, market and technology trends and improve our ability to adapt and grow successfully. In our Foundry Services Group, we strive to maintain competitiveness by offering high-value added processes, high-flexibility and excellent service by tailoring existing standard processes to meet customers' design needs and porting customers' own process technologies into our fabrication facilities.\nMaterial Costs. Our cost of material consists of costs of raw materials, such as silicon wafers, chemicals, gases and tape and packaging supplies. We use processes that require specialized raw materials, such as silicon wafers, that are generally available from a limited number of suppliers. If demand increases or supplies decrease, the costs of our raw materials could increase significantly.\nGross Profit\n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt; \nNet sales were $750.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a $71.2 million, or 10.5%, increase compared to $679.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue from our Standard Products Group, which was offset in part by a decrease in revenue from our Foundry Services Group.\nAs of December 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents held by our Korean subsidiary were $109.0 million, which represents 82% of our total cash and cash equivalents of $132.4 million on a consolidated basis. We, as a holding company resident in the United States, issued our 2021 Notes. Payments under our outstanding 2021 Notes are currently funded in part by our Korean subsidiary's repayment of its existing loans from our Dutch subsidiary, with our Dutch subsidiary using such repayments in turn to repay the loans owed to our Luxembourg subsidiary, which repays loans owed to us. Our Exchangeable Notes were issued by our Luxembourg subsidiary and the proceeds from the Exchangeable Notes Offering, were transferred to our Dutch and Korean subsidiaries through intercompany loans. Therefore, we expect payments under the Exchangeable Notes to be funded in part by our Korean subsidiary's repayment of its existing or new loans from our Dutch subsidiary, with our Dutch subsidiary using such repayments in turn to repay loans owed to our Luxembourg subsidiary.\nStandard Products Group. Gross profit from our Standard Products Group segment was $85.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a $2.4 million, or 2.8%, increase from $83.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased to 26.1% compared to 21.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was mainly attributable to a higher utilization rate and a favorable impact from reduction in headcount, which was offset in part primarily by an increase in wafer price and employee costs associated with unused vacation.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses were $78.0 million, or 10.4%, of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $70.5 million, or 10.4%, of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase of $7.5 million, or 10.7%, was primarily attributable to an increase in development activities for new OLED products.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nForeign Currency Gain (Loss), Net. Net foreign currency gain for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $65.5 million compared to net foreign currency loss of $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The net foreign currency gain for the year ended December 31, 2017 was due to the appreciation in value of the Korean won relative to the US dollar during the period. The net foreign currency loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 was due to the depreciation in value of the Korean won relative to the US dollar during the period.\n \u2022 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; \nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions and our effective tax rate is affected by changes in the mix of earnings between countries with differing tax rates. Our primary foreign operations are in Korea where the statutory tax rate applicable to us was approximately 24.2% in each of 2018 and 2017. Statutory tax rates for our foreign subsidiaries except those in Luxembourg, Netherlands and Korea, were less than the US federal statutory rate of 21.0%.\nOperating Expenses\nSales of Accounts Receivable\nRestructuring and Other Gain. Restructuring and other gain of $17.0 million recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from a $16.6 million restructuring gain on the sale of the building related to the closure of our 6-inch fab and a $0.4 million gain on sale of our sensor business.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $81.8 million, or 12.0% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $83.5 million, or 12.1% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease of $1.8 million, or 2.1%, was attributable to a $2.9 million decrease in salary expense as a result of our headcount reduction and a $6.6 million decrease in professional fees mainly comprised of legal and consulting services. These decreases were offset in part primarily by a $4.2 million charge of the additional tax assessment and associated penalties and administrative fine as a result of the tax audit conducted by the KNTS which concluded in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nContractual Obligations\nStandard Products Group. Net sales from our Standard Products Group segment were $425.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a $96.3 million, or 29.3%, increase compared to $329.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue related to an improvement in mobile OLED display driver ICs due to the introduction of new OLED smartphones by Chinese manufacturers and higher demand for premium power products such as high-end MOSFETs and IGBTs primarily for TV and industrial applications. This increase was offset in part by a strategic reduction of our lower margin LCD business.\n \u2022 Adjusted Net Income (Loss) does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018:\n\n (3) Assumes constant currency exchange rate for Korean won to US dollars of 1,118.1:1, the exchange rate as of December 31, 2018. \nSecondary offering\n (b) This adjustment eliminates the charges related to the reduction of workforce through the Headcount Reduction Plan in the first half of 2017 and the Program in the second quarter of 2016. As these termination related charges are recorded as a result of implementing the company-wide headcount reduction and are not \n (c) This adjustment eliminates the impact of non-cash equity-based compensation expenses. Although we expect to incur non-cash equity-based compensation expenses in the future, these expenses do not generally require cash settlement, and, therefore, are not used by us to assess the profitability of our operations. We believe that analysts and investors will find it helpful to review our operating performance without the effects of these non-cash expenses as supplemental information. \nWe routinely make capital expenditures for fabrication facility maintenance, enhancement of our existing facilities and reinforcement of our global research and development capability. For the year ended December 31, 2017, capital expenditures for plant, property and equipment were $32.7 million, a $13.9 million, or 74.4%, increase from $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was mainly for meeting our customer demand, and supporting technology and facility improvements at our fabrication facilities.\nAs a result of the foregoing, net income decreased by $88.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. As discussed above, the decrease primarily resulted from a $90.0 million increase in foreign currency loss and a $3.5 million increase in income tax expenses, which was partially offset by an $8.2 million increase in operating income.\nAs a result, the aggregate tax and penalty assessment by the KNTS was $6.0 million, of which $3.3 million had already been accrued by us in our financial statements in connection with the Restatement filed in 2015. Such amount also included approximately $0.5 million related to employee withholding amounts and associated penalties, and to the extent any such tax obligation was that of MSK's employees. In addition, KNTS assessed an administrative fine of $2.0 million in connection with the above-described tax audit.\n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; \nGross Profit. Our overall gross profit generally fluctuates as a result of changes in overall sales volumes and in the average selling prices of our products and services. Other factors that influence our gross profit include changes in product mix, the introduction of new products and services and subsequent generations of existing products and services, shifts in the utilization of our manufacturing facilities and the yields achieved by our manufacturing operations, changes in material, labor and other manufacturing costs including outsourced manufacturing expenses, and variation in depreciation expense.\n (h) This adjustment eliminates expenses related to the repurchase of a portion of the 2021 Notes and the Exchangeable Notes in December 2018. \nWe routinely make capital expenditures for fabrication facility maintenance, enhancement of our existing facilities and reinforcement of our global research and development capability. For the year ended December 31, 2018, capital expenditures for plant, property and equipment were $33.2 million, a $0.6 million, or 1.7%, increase from $32.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2018 included a $4.3 million payment for the purchase of the water treatment facility. The remaining expenditures were related to meeting our customer demand, and supporting technology and facility improvements at our fabrication facilities.\nWater Treatment Facility Arrangement\nNet sales in Asia Pacific for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased from $391.9 million to $322.6 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, or by $69.3 million, or 17.7%, primarily due to lower level of sales of OLED display driver ICs, which was partially offset by an increase in sales of certain products from higher demand for our foundry services.\nOthers, Net. Others were comprised of gains and losses on the valuation of derivatives which were designated as hedging instruments, rental income and interest income. Others for the year ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were $2.9 million and $3.0 million, respectively.\n \u2022 we believe that reporting Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is useful to readers in evaluating our core operating results because it eliminates the effects of non-cash expenses as well as the other items we discuss below, such as foreign currency gains and losses, which are out of our control and can vary significantly from period to period.  Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is not a measure defined in accordance with US GAAP and should not be construed as an alternative to income from continuing operations, cash flows from operating activities or net income, as determined in accordance with US GAAP. We encourage you to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons we consider them appropriate. Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted Net Income (Loss) differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted Net Income (Loss), you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation. We define Adjusted Net Income (Loss) for the periods indicated as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude (i) restructuring and other gain, net, (ii) early termination charges, (iii) equity-based compensation expense, (iv) foreign currency loss (gain), net, (v) derivative valuation loss (gain), net, (vi) restatement related expenses (gain), (vii) secondary offering expense, (viii) loss on early extinguishment of long-term borrowings, net and (ix) other indemnification costs and reimbursement.\nWe believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical due to the fact that they involve a high degree of judgment and estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. We base these estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and other assumptions and information that we believe to be reasonable. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Accordingly, these estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the business environment in which we operate changes.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $21.6 million compared to interest expense of $16.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase of $5.3 million was attributable to the interest expense recorded for the Exchangeable Notes issued in January 2017.\nTax Audit\nOn January 22, 2016, we entered into a stipulation of settlement with the plaintiffs in the shareholder derivative actions, as described in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in this Report, for an aggregate payment of $3.0 million from our insurance proceeds that were received in the first quarter of 2016 and recorded in the escrow account. In October 2016, the court approved the settlement of the shareholder derivative actions for $3.0 million, which included $0.75 million awarded to plaintiffs' counsel. Upon the expiration of the appeals period, $2.25 million was disbursed from the escrow account, previously recorded as restricted cash, in December 2016. The remaining restricted cash related to insurance proceeds of $3.1 million was also released in December 2016.\nOthers, Net. Others were comprised of gains and losses on the valuation of derivatives which were designated as hedging instruments, rental income and interest income. Others for the year ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were $0.3 million and $2.9 million, respectively.\nSale of Sensor Business\nWe lease land, office space and equipment under various operating lease agreements that expire through 2034.\nGross Profit\nNet Sales. We derive virtually all of our sales (net of sales returns and allowances) from two segments: Foundry Services Group and Standard Products Group. Our product inventory is primarily located in Korea and is available for drop shipment globally. Outside of Korea, we maintain limited product inventory, and our sales representatives generally relay orders to our factories in Korea for fulfillment. We have strategically located our sales and technical support offices near concentrations of major customers. Our sales offices are located in Korea, the United States, Japan and Greater China. Our network of authorized agents and distributors is in the United States, Europe and the Asia Pacific region. Our net sales from All other consist principally of the disposal of scrap materials.\n\n Net Sales\n\n other expenses. For 2018, this adjustment eliminates the reversal of a $0.8 million accrual related to certain legal fees incurred in prior periods and reimbursed by insurers in the first quarter of 2018. For 2017, this adjustment includes the $3.0 million civil penalty imposed by the SEC and the $4.3 million of the additional tax assessment and associated penalties, primarily related to non-income-based VAT transactions in the Restatement periods, administrative fine and related legal fees. As these expenses meaningfully impacted our operating results and are not expected to represent an ongoing operating expense to us, we believe our operating performance results are more usefully compared if these expenses are excluded. \nTotal gross profit was $198.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $187.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a $10.2 million, or 5.4%, increase. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased to 26.4% compared to 27.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to a decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales from our Foundry Services Group, which was offset in part by an increase in gross profits as a percentage of net sales from our Standard Products Group.\nIntangible assets other than intellectual property include technology and customer relationships which are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from one to five years. Intellectual property assets acquired represent rights under patents, trademarks and property use rights and are amortized over their respective periods of benefit, ranging up to ten years, on a straight-line basis.\nFactors Affecting Our Results of Operations\n \u2022 Adjusted Net Income (Loss) does not reflect the costs of holding certain assets and liabilities in foreign currencies; and \n \u2022 in certain of our compensation plans as a performance measure for determining incentive compensation payments. \nFrom time to time, we may engage in exchange rate hedging activities in an effort to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. Our Korean subsidiary enters into foreign currency forward and zero cost collar contracts in order to mitigate a portion of the impact of US dollar-Korean won exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results. Obligations under these foreign currency forward and zero cost collar contracts must be cash collateralized if our exposure exceeds certain specified thresholds. These forward and zero cost collar contracts may be terminated by the counterparty in a number of circumstances, including if our total cash and cash\nWe report net sales by geographic region based on the location to which the products are billed. The following table sets forth our net sales by geographic region and the percentage of total net sales represented by each geographic region for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nThere was no tax impact from the adjustments to net income to calculate our Adjusted Net Income (Loss) for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 due to net operating loss carry-forwards available to offset taxable income and full allowance for deferred tax assets. We believe that all adjustments to net income (loss) used to calculate Adjusted Net Income (Loss) were applied consistently to the periods presented.\nResults of Operations\n expected to represent ongoing operating expenses to us, we believe our operating performance results are more usefully compared if these expenses are excluded. \nSegment Change\nWe present Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as a further supplemental measure of our performance. We prepare Adjusted Net Income (Loss) by adjusting net income (loss) to eliminate the impact of a number of non-cash expenses and other items that may be either one time or recurring that we do not consider to be indicative of our core ongoing operating performance. We believe that Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is particularly useful because it reflects the impact of our asset base and capital structure on our operating performance. We present Adjusted Net Income (Loss) for a number of reasons, including:\npurchase levels. As these vendor rebates are impacted by actual and estimated purchases for the applicable agreed upon period, we periodically assess the progress of our purchase levels and revise the estimates when necessary. We account for such rebates as a reduction of inventory until we sell the product, at which time such rebates are reflected as a reduction of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations. Vendor rebates recorded as a reduction of cost of sales were $0.4 million, $0.4 million and $4.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and recorded as a reduction of inventory were $0, $0 and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOur wide variety of analog and mixed-signal semiconductor products and manufacturing services combined with our mature technology platform allow us to address multiple high-growth end markets and to rapidly develop and introduce new products and services in response to market demands. Our design center and substantial manufacturing operations in Korea place us at the core of the global electronics device supply chain. We believe this enables us to quickly and efficiently respond to our customers' needs and allows us to better serve and capture additional demand from existing and new customers.\nWe may, from time to time, repurchase a portion of our outstanding 2021 Notes and our Exchangeable Notes through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions subject to prevailing market conditions and our available cash reserves.\nWe report net sales by geographic region based on the location to which the products are billed. The following table sets forth our net sales by geographic region and the percentage of total net sales represented by each geographic region for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nAverage Selling Prices. Average selling prices for our products tend to be highest at the time of introduction of new products which utilize the latest technology and tend to decrease over time as such products mature in the market and are replaced by next generation products. We strive to offset the impact of declining selling prices for existing products through our product development activities and by introducing new products that command selling prices above the average selling price of our existing products. In addition, we seek to manage our inventories and manufacturing capacity so as to preclude losses from product and productive capacity obsolescence.\nOn August 15, 2017, certain of our stockholders that are affiliates of Avenue Capital Management II, L.P. (the \u201cSelling Stockholders\u201d) closed an underwritten registered public offering of 4,088,978 shares of our common stock at a price per share of $11.10. We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of our common stock by the Selling Stockholders, but paid certain expenses in connection with such secondary offering pursuant to an existing contractual arrangement with the Selling Stockholders.\nRestatement\nThe following table sets forth consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nInventories. We monitor our inventory levels in light of product development changes and market expectations. We may be required to take additional charges for quantities in excess of demand, cost in excess of market value and product age. Our analysis may take into consideration historical usage, expected demand, anticipated sales price, new product development schedules, the effect new products might have on the sales of existing products, product age, customer design activity, customer concentration and other factors. These forecasts require us to estimate our ability to predict demand for current and future products and compare those estimates with our current inventory levels and inventory purchase commitments. Our forecasts for our inventory may differ from actual inventory use.\nAs a result of the Restatement, we incurred substantial external accounting, legal and other related costs associated with the Restatement and certain litigation and other regulatory investigations and actions related thereto. We recorded Restatement related costs of $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which included tax assessment, and associated penalties of $4.3 million, primarily related to non-income-based VAT transactions in the Restatement periods, compared to $7.0 million of Restatement related costs for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the three months March 31, 2018, the reversal of a $0.8 million accrual related to certain legal fees, incurred in prior periods and reimbursed by insurers in the current quarter, was recorded as a Restatement related gain.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions and our effective tax rate is affected by changes in the mix of earnings between countries with differing tax rates. Our primary foreign operations are in Korea where the statutory tax rate applicable to us was approximately 24.2% in 2017 and 2016. Statutory tax rates for all foreign subsidiaries were less than the US federal statutory rate of 35.0%.\nAs a result of the foregoing, operating income increased by $36.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. As discussed above, the increase in operating income resulted from a $31.7 million increase in gross profit, a $1.8 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses, a $1.7 million decrease in research and development expenses and a $10.5 million increase in restructuring gain, which was partially offset by a $9.1 million increase in termination related charges.\n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of issuing equity-based compensation to our management team and employees; \nAs of December 21, 2016, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell a building located in Cheongju, South Korea. The building has historically been used to house the 6-inch fab and became vacant upon the closure of the fabrication facility. As of December 31, 2015, the building was fully impaired. We received proceeds of $18.2 million, including a $1.7 million value-added tax, for the sale of the building on December 26, 2016. We recorded the $18.2 million as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2016 as we were obligated to perform certain removal construction work that was expected to be completed by the end of March 2017. During the first quarter of 2017, we completed all removal construction work necessary to transfer the title of the building, and the $18.2 million of restricted cash was fully released.\nThe following table summarizes the adjustments to net income (loss) that we make in order to calculate Adjusted Net Income (Loss) for the periods indicated:\nSelling Expenses. We sell our products worldwide through a direct sales force as well as a network of sales agents and representatives to OEMs, including major branded customers and contract manufacturers, and\n (2) Interest payments as well as $224.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes outstanding as of December 31, 2018, which bear interest at a rate of 6.625% per annum and are scheduled to mature in 2021 if not earlier redeemed. \nWe are a designer and manufacturer of analog and mixed-signal semiconductor platform solutions for communications, IoT, consumer, industrial and automotive applications. We provide technology platforms for analog, mixed-signal, power, high voltage, non-volatile memory, and RF applications. We have a proven record with about 40 years of operating history, a portfolio of approximately 3,000 registered patents and pending applications and extensive engineering and manufacturing process expertise.\nCash inflow generated by financing activities totaled $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $72.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The financing cash inflow for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to proceeds of $4.3 million in connection with the water treatment facility arrangement and $1.1 million of proceeds received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options, which was offset in part by the payment of $2.2 million for the repurchases of 2021 Notes and Exchangeable Notes in December 2018 and $1.6 million for the repurchase of our common stock in December 2018 pursuant to our stock repurchase plan. The financing cash inflow for the year ended December 31, 2017 consisted of $80.3 million of net proceeds received from the issuance of the Exchangeable\nThe following table sets forth consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2016\nWe review property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 360, \u201cProperty, Plant and Equipment\u201d. Recoverability is measured by comparing its carrying amount with the future net undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the assets and the fair value of assets using the present value of the future net cash flows generated by the respective long-lived assets.\nAs of January 17, 2017, we closed the offering (the \u201cExchangeable Notes Offering\u201d) by our Luxembourg subsidiary, MagnaChip Semiconductor S.A., of $86.25 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.00% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2021 (the \u201cExchangeable Notes\u201d), reflecting the full exercise of the initial purchasers' option to purchase additional Exchangeable Notes. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the Exchangeable Notes Offering to repurchase 1,795,444 shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program, which was authorized by our board of directors on January 10, 2017, at an aggregate cost of $11.4 million.\nPreparing financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, the\n and mixed-signal process technologies such as high voltage complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS), non-volatile memory or bipolar-CMOS-DMOS (BCD). These customers typically serve the consumer, computing, communication, industrial, automotive and IoT applications. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our Foundry Services Group business represented 43.3% of our net sales and its gross profit was $82.6 million. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our Foundry Services Group business represented, on an adjusted basis after recasting, 51.6% and 43.5% of our net sales, respectively, and its gross profit was $101.8 million and $73.1 million, respectively, as adjusted for the segment change described above. \nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nbegan to pay a portion of the $4.2 million other termination benefits under the Program, which were paid in equal monthly installments over twelve months. We recorded the $4.2 million charge related to the full amount of these other termination benefits payable under the Program during the second quarter of 2016.\n Net Sales\nProduct Warranties\nOur principal capital requirements are to fund sales and marketing, invest in research and development and capital equipment, to make debt service payments and to fund working capital needs. We calculate working capital as current assets less current liabilities.\nWe are a party to arrangements for the water treatment facilities in Cheongju and Gumi, Korea, which include 5-year and 10-year service agreements, respectively.\nNet Sales by Geographic Region\n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \nIntangible Assets\nWithin our Standard Products Group, net sales are driven by design wins in which we are selected by an electronics original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or other potential customer to supply its demand for a particular product. A customer will often have more than one supplier designed in to multi-source components for a particular product line. Once we have design wins and the products enter into mass production, we often specify the pricing of a particular product for a set period of time, with periodic discussions and renegotiations of pricing with our customers. In any given period, our net sales depend heavily upon the end-market demand for the goods in which our products are used, the inventory levels maintained by our customers and in some cases, allocation of demand for components for a particular product among selected qualified suppliers.\nAll Other. All other gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $0.2 million. All other gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 was a negative $0.4 million mainly attributable to training and transition costs related to our closed 6-inch fab employees, which was partially offset by revenue from the disposal of waste materials.\nequivalents is less than $30.0 million at the end of a fiscal quarter unless a waiver is obtained from the counterparty. We cannot assure that any hedging technique we implement will be effective. If our hedging activities are not effective, changes in currency exchange rates may have a more significant impact on our results of operations.\nDemand for our products and services is driven by overall demand for communications, IoT, consumer, industrial and automotive products and can be adversely affected by periods of weak consumer and enterprise spending or by market share losses by our customers. In order to mitigate the impact of market volatility on our business, we are diversifying our portfolio of products, customers, and target applications. We also expect that new competitors will emerge in these markets that may place increased pressure on the pricing for our products and services. While we believe we are well positioned competitively to compete in these markets and against these new competitors as a result of our long operating history, existing manufacturing capacity and our\nindirectly through distributors. Selling expenses consist primarily of the personnel costs for the members of our direct sales force, a network of sales representatives and other costs of distribution. Personnel costs include base salary, benefits and incentive compensation.\nCash outflow used in investing activities totaled $33.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $35.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $2.1 million decrease in investing activities was attributable to a $5.7 million net decrease in hedge collateral, which was partially offset by a $3.6 million net increase in guarantee deposits.\nIn January 2018, as part of our ongoing portfolio optimization effort to realign business processes and streamline our organizational structure, we transferred a portion of our non-OLED display solutions business from our Standards Products Group to our Foundry Services Group. The transferred non-OLED display business has technical and business characteristics more closely aligned with our Foundry Services business than with our Standard Products business, which resided within our Display solutions business line primarily as a result of a long standing customer relationship established many years ago. We recast comparative segment financial information to conform to this current period change.\nIn accordance with ASC 815, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are cash flow hedges are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings in the period in which the hedged item affects earnings. Ineffective portions of a derivative instrument's change in fair value are immediately recognized in earnings. Derivative instruments that do not qualify, or cease to qualify, as hedges must be adjusted to fair value and the adjustments are recorded through net income (loss).\nBoth at the inception of a hedge and on an ongoing basis, a hedge must be expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in cash flows or fair value attributable to the underlying risk being hedged. If we determine that a derivative instrument is no longer highly effective as a hedge, it discontinues hedge accounting prospectively and future changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in current earnings. We assess hedge effectiveness at the end of each quarter.\nNet sales from our Display Solutions business line were $179.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a $77.6 million, or 30.2%, decrease from $256.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenue from our mobile OLED display driver ICs stemming from a timing mismatch between the drop-off in revenue from our existing OLED products and the introduction of new OLED products, and also from a prolonged slowdown in the China smartphone market. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenue from large display products mainly due to higher demand of source drivers for ultra high definition TVs. Net sales from our Power Solutions business line were $149.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a $18.4 million, or 14.0%, increase from $131.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in sales was primarily due to premium power products and MOSFETs for TV and mobile battery applications.\n Results by segment\nOur Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $84.3 million and $27.1 million, respectively. Our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $78.7 million and $28.9 million, respectively. Our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $40.7 million and $4.5 million, respectively.\n\n (a) For the year ended December 31, 2017, this adjustment eliminates the $16.6 million restructuring gain on sale of a building in connection with the closure of our 6-inch fab and the $0.4 million gain on sale of our sensor business. For the year ended December 31, 2016, this adjustment eliminates the $7.8 million restructuring gain on sale of machinery in connection with the closure of our 6-inch fab, net of $2.3 million training and transition costs related to our 6-inch fab employees. \nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, using the first in, first out method (\u201cFIFO\u201d). If net realizable value is less than cost at the balance sheet date, the carrying amount is reduced to the realizable value, and the difference is recognized as a loss on valuation of inventories within cost of sales. Inventory reserves are established when conditions indicate that the net realizable value is less than costs due to physical deterioration, obsolescence, changes in price levels, or other causes based on individual facts and circumstances. We evaluate the sufficiency of inventory reserves and take into consideration historical usage, expected demand, anticipated sales price, new product development schedules, the effect new products might have on the sale of existing products, product age and other factors. Reserves are also established for excess inventory based on our current inventory levels and projected demand and our ability to sell those specific products. Situations that could cause these inventory reserves include a decline in business and economic conditions, decline in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decline in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and consumer requirements, or failure to estimate end customer demand properly. A reduction of these inventory reserves may be recorded if previously reserved items are subsequently sold as a result of unexpected changes to certain aforementioned situations.\nWe recorded income tax expenses of $4.6 million and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in income tax expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to taxable income generated by our Korean subsidiary combined with its ability to utilize net operating carryforwards up to 70% of the taxable income, and a decrease in our uncertain tax positions that resulted in a reduction of income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our effective tax rate was 620.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to 1.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIncome Taxes. We record our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves using an asset and liability approach whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for differences in the financial reporting bases and tax bases of our assets and liabilities. We exercise significant management judgment in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities. We assess whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets existing at the period-end will be realized in future periods. In such assessment, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent results of operations. In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize the deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would adjust the valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.\n (f) This adjustment eliminates expenses in connection with the Audit Committee's independent investigation and related restatement and litigation, primarily comprised of legal, audit and consulting fees, and certain other expenses. For 2018, this adjustment eliminates the reversal of a $0.8 million accrual related to certain legal fees incurred in prior periods and reimbursed by insurers in the first quarter of 2018. For 2017, this adjustment includes the $3.0 million civil penalty imposed by the SEC and the $4.3 million of the additional tax assessment and associated penalties, primarily related to non-income-based VAT transactions in the Restatement periods, administrative fine and related legal fees. As these expenses meaningfully impacted our operating results and are not expected to represent an ongoing operating expense to us, we believe our operating performance results are more usefully compared if these expenses are excluded. \nInterest Expense. Interest expenses were $22.3 million and $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nIn September 2017, MagnaChip Semiconductor Ltd. (\u201cMSK\u201d), our Korean operating subsidiary, was notified that the Korean National Tax Service (the \u201cKNTS\u201d) would be examining the income- and non-income-based taxes of MSK for its 2012 to 2014 tax years. The KNTS had conducted its audit, primarily focusing on non-income-based value added tax (\u201cVAT\u201d) transactions associated with the periods with respect to which we previously restated our financial statements as a result of the independent investigation commenced by our Audit Committee in January 2014 (the \u201cRestatement\u201d).\nEvents associated with the closure of our 6-inch fab and reduction of workforce\nInventories\nAll Other. All other net sales were $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively.\nCash outflow used in operating activities totaled $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $9.4 million of cash inflow provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016. The net operating cash outflow for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflects our net income of $84.9 million and non-cash adjustments of a net negative $37.7 million, which mainly consisted of depreciation and amortization, provision for severance benefits and net foreign currency gain, and a net decrease in operating assets and liabilities of $67.5 million. The decrease in operating assets and liabilities was primarily related to an increase in accounts receivable as of December 31, 2017 due to a significant decrease in accounts receivable discounting during 2017 and the payments of statutory severance to the employees that resigned from our Company.\nNet sales in Europe for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased from $41.1 million to $47.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, or by $6.7 million, or 16.4%, primarily due to an increase in sales of certain battery charger related products from a global power management IC foundry customer, which was offset in part by lower demand from a customer serving the high-end smartphone market.\nNet sales were $679.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an $8.3 million, or 1.2%, decrease compared to $688.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily attributable to a net decrease in revenue from our Standard Products Group, which was offset in part by an increase in revenue from our Foundry Services Group as described below.\nOther Income (Expense)\nAs a result of the foregoing, net income increased by $114.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. As discussed above, the increase primarily resulted from a $36.5 million increase in operating income and an $80.9 million increase in foreign currency gain, which was partially offset by a $5.3 million increase in interest expense recorded for the Exchangeable Notes issued in January 2017.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncement\nSubstantially all of our contracts are one year or less in duration. The standard payment terms with customers are generally thirty to sixty days from the time of shipment, product delivery to the customer's location or customer acceptance, depending on the terms of the related arrangement.\nLabor Costs. A significant portion of our employees are located in Korea. Under Korean labor laws, most employees and certain executive officers with one or more years of service are entitled to severance benefits upon the termination of their employment based on their length of service and rate of pay. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 98% of our employees were eligible for severance benefits.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balance was $128.6 million, a $27.0 million increase, compared to $101.6 million as of December 31, 2016. The increase resulted from a $72.7 million of cash inflow provided by financing activities, which was partially offset by a $20.3 million of cash outflow used in operating activities and a $35.4 million of cash outflow used in investing activities.\nEarly Termination Charges. Termination related charges related to the reduction of workforce through the Headcount Reduction Plan for the year ended December 31, 2017 and the Program for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $13.4 million and $4.2 million, respectively.\n \u2022 Standard Products Group: Our Standard Products Group includes our Display Solutions and Power Solutions business lines. Our Display Solutions products include source, gate drivers, timing controllers, and one-chip integrated solutions that cover a wide range of panel displays used in ultra high definition (UHD), high definition (HD), light emitting diode (LED), 3D and OLED televisions public displays, notebooks, mobile communications, entertainment devices and automotive applications. Our Display Solutions products support the industry's most advanced display technologies, such as OLEDs, and low temperature polysilicons (LTPS), as well as high-volume display technologies such as thin film transistors (TFT). Since 2007, we have designed and manufactured OLED display driver IC products. Our current portfolio of OLED solutions address a wide range of resolutions ranging from HD to Wide Quad High Definition (WQHD) for applications including smartphones, TVs, and other mobile devices. We believe we have a unique intellectual property portfolio and mixed-signal design and manufacturing expertise in the OLED industry. Our Power Solutions business line produces power management semiconductor products including discrete and integrated circuit solutions for power management in high-volume consumer applications. These products include metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs), insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs), AC-DC converters, DC-DC converters, LED drivers, switching regulators and linear regulators for a range of devices, including televisions, smartphones, mobile phones, desktop PCs, notebooks, tablet PCs, other consumer electronics, and industrial applications such as power suppliers, LED lighting, motor control and home appliances. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our Standard Products Group, which includes our Display Solutions and Power Solutions business lines, represented 56.7% of our net sales and its gross profit was $115.5 million. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our Standard Products Group business represented, on an adjusted basis after recasting, 48.4% and 56.4% of our net sales, respectively, and its gross profit was $85.9 million and $83.5 million, respectively, as adjusted for the segment change described above \nIncome Taxes\nOur Standards Products Group sells products manufactured based on our design. Our products are either standardized with an alternative use or we do not have an enforceable right to payment for the related manufacturing services completed to date. For those products, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of the product, which is generally upon product shipment, delivery at the customer's location or upon customer acceptance, depending on the terms of the arrangement.\nWe are subject to income- or non-income-based tax examinations by tax authorities of the US, Korea and multiple other foreign jurisdictions, where applicable, for all open tax years. Significant estimates and judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income- or non-income based taxes. Some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations. The ultimate amount of tax liability may be uncertain as a result. See \u201cItem 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 16. Income Taxes\u201d included elsewhere in this Report.\nYear ended December 31, 2018 compared to year ended December 31, 2017\nNet sales in the United States for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased from $35.1 million to $37.5 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, or by $2.4 million, or 6.8%, primarily due to an increase in sales of certain products from a global power management IC foundry customer.\nOverview\n (g) This adjustment eliminates expenses incurred for the secondary offering by the Selling Stockholders primarily in the third quarter of 2017. \nNet sales in the Asia Pacific for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased from $322.6 million to $380.6 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, or by $58.0 million, or 18.0%, primarily due to an increase in revenue related to increased sales to mobile OLED display driver ICs in connection with the introduction of new OLED smartphones. This increase was in part offset by a decrease in sales of certain products from a foundry customer serving the low- to mid-range mobile phone market, and a decrease in sales of certain low margin products from a global power management IC foundry customer.\nOur working capital balance as of December 31, 2017 was $192.1 million compared to $89.3 million as of December 31, 2016. The $102.9 million increase was primarily attributable to a $45.2 million increase in cash and cash equivalents, a $30.3 million increase in account receivables, a $16.0 million increase in inventory and a $16.5 million decrease in deposits received, which were partially offset by an $18.3 million decrease in restricted cash and a $14.4 million increase in account payables.\nVendor Rebates\n (i) This adjustment eliminates a $0.4 million legal expense related to the indemnification of a former employee. As the legal expense for the former employee is borne by us under a negotiated separation agreement, we do not believe that this charge is indicative of our core operating performance and has been excluded for comparative purposes. \nIssuance of Exchangeable Senior Notes and Stock Repurchase\n \u2022 we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is commonly requested and used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of the Company as an enterprise level performance measure that \nRestructuring and Other Charges(Gain), Net. Restructuring and other charges (gain), net of $17.0 million recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from a $16.6 million restructuring gain on the sale of the building related to the closure of our 6-inch fab and a $0.4 million gain on sale of our sensor business. Restructuring and other charges (gain), net of $6.5 million recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted from the sale of machinery related to the closure of our 6-inch fab, which was offset by $1.3 million of training and transition costs related to the employees at our closed 6-inch fab.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nEarly Termination Charges. Early termination charges of $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 were recorded for the termination benefits payable to the employees affected under our Headcount Reduction Plan.\nAs of April 29, 2016, 169 employees elected to resign under the terms of the Program. We paid approximately $8 million for severance benefits, which are required by law and had already been fully accrued in our financial statements, in a lump sum during the second quarter of 2016. Beginning in May 2016, we also\nWe account for transfers of financial assets under ASC 860, \u201cTransfers and Servicing,\u201d as either sales or financings. Transfers of financial assets that result in sales accounting are those in which (1) the transfer legally\n (1) Interest payments as well as $84.66 million aggregate principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes outstanding as of December 31, 2018, which bear interest at a rate of 5.0% per annum and are scheduled to mature in 2021 if not earlier converted. \nIn December 2018, we repurchased a principal amount of $0.5 million and $1.6 million of the 2021 Notes and the Exchangeable Notes, respectively. As a result, we recorded a $0.2 million net loss as early extinguishment loss on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nA substantial portion of our net foreign currency gain or loss is non-cash translation gain or loss associated with the intercompany long-term loans to our Korean subsidiary, which is denominated in US dollars, and is affected by changes in the exchange rate between the Korean won and the US dollar. As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding intercompany loan balance including accrued interest between our Korean subsidiary and our Dutch subsidiary was $666.6 million. Foreign currency translation gain or loss from intercompany balances was included in determining our consolidated net income since the intercompany balances were not considered long-term investments in nature because management intended to settle these intercompany balances at their respective maturity dates.\nNet Sales by Geographic Region\nIn January 2018, as part of our ongoing portfolio optimization effort to realign business processes and streamline our organizational structure, we transferred a portion of our non-OLED display solutions business\n (e) This adjustment eliminates the impact of gain or loss recognized in income on derivatives, which represents hedge ineffectiveness or derivatives value changes excluded from the risk being hedged. We enter into derivative transactions to mitigate foreign exchange risks. As our derivative transactions are limited to a certain portion of our expected cash flows denominated in US dollars, and we do not enter into derivative transactions for trading or speculative purposes, we do not believe that these charges or gains are indicative of our core operating performance. \nThe cash flows from derivative instruments receiving hedge accounting treatment are classified in the same categories as the hedged items in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n (g) This adjustment eliminates expenses incurred for the secondary offering by the Selling Stockholders primarily in the third quarter of 2017. \nForeign Currency Gain (Loss), Net. Net foreign currency loss for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $24.4 million compared to net foreign currency gain of $65.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net foreign currency loss for the year ended December 31, 2018 was due to the depreciation in value of the Korean won relative to the US dollar during the period. The net foreign currency gain for the year ended December 31, 2017 was due to the appreciation in value of the Korean won relative to the US dollar during the period.\nreported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and the related disclosures in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\n \u2022 for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget; \nTotal gross profit was $187.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $156.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a $31.7 million, or 20.3%, increase. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased to 27.6% compared to 22.7% for the year ended December 31,\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $72.6 million, or 9.7% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $81.8 million, or 12.0%\n \u2022 other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.  Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our US GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA only supplementally.\n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the costs of holding certain assets and liabilities in foreign currencies; and \n (5) Includes license agreements, funding obligations for the accrued severance benefits and other contractual obligations.  The indentures relating to the Exchangeable Notes and the 2021 Notes contain covenants as detailed in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 10. Long-term Borrowings\u201d in this Report. Those covenants are subject to a number of exceptions and qualifications. Certain of those restrictive covenants will terminate if the Exchangeable Notes or the 2021 Notes are rated investment grade at any time.\n \u2022 we use Adjusted Net Income (Loss) in communications with our Board of Directors concerning our consolidated financial performance without the impact of non-cash expenses and the other items as we discussed below since we believe that it is a more consistent measure of our core operating results from period to period; and \nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under US GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nStandard Products Group. Gross profit from our Standard Products Group segment was $115.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a $29.6 million, or 34.4%, increase from $85.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased to 27.1% compared to 26.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in both gross profit and gross profit margin was primarily attributable to a favorable product mix from an increase in sales of mobile OLED display driver ICs.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, our cash flows from operations and our financing activities. Our ability to manage cash and cash equivalents may be limited, as our primary cash flows are dictated by the terms of our sales and supply agreements, contractual obligations, debt instruments and legal and regulatory requirements. From time to time, we may sell accounts receivable to third parties under factoring agreements or engage in accounts receivable discounting to facilitate the collection of cash. For a description of our factoring arrangements and accounts receivable discounting, please see \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 3. Accounts Receivable\u201d included elsewhere in this Report. In addition, from time to time, we may make payments to our vendors on extended terms with their consent. As of December 31, 2018, we do not have any accounts payable on extended terms or payment deferment with our vendors.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain information related to our operations, expressed in US dollars and as a percentage of our net sales:\nIn December 2014, we announced that our Board of Directors had adopted a plan to close our 6-inch fab. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we received an $8.2 million deposit for sale of machinery in conjunction with the planned closure of our 6-inch fab. According to this plan, the 6-inch fab was closed on February 29, 2016. During the first quarter of 2016, we completed all procedures necessary to sell all machineries in our closed 6-inch fab and recognized a $7.8 million restructuring gain from the related deposit of $8.2 million, net of certain direct selling costs. On April 4, 2016, we commenced a voluntary resignation program (the \u201cProgram\u201d), which was available to certain manufacturing employees, including our 6-inch fab employees, through April 29, 2016.\nCash inflow generated by financing activities totaled $72.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $71.0 million increase was primarily was attributable to $80.3 million of net proceeds received from the issuance of the Exchangeable Notes and a $2.0 million increase in proceeds received from exercised stock options, which was partly offset by the payment of $11.4 million for the repurchase of 1,795,444 shares of our common stock in January 2017 pursuant to our stock repurchase plan.\nSegments\nisolates the transferred assets from the transferor, (2) the transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the transferred assets and no condition both constrains the transferee's right to pledge or exchange the assets and provides more than a trivial benefit to the transferor and (3) the transferor does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets. If the transfer does not meet these criteria, the transfer is accounted for as a financing. Financial assets that are treated as sales are removed from our accounts with any realized gain or loss reflected in earnings during the period of sale.\n Results by segment\nWe currently believe that we will have sufficient cash reserves from cash on hand and expected cash from operations to fund our operations as well as capital expenditures for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Long-Term Borrowings, Net. In December 2018, we repurchased a principal amount of $0.5 million and $1.6 million of the 2021 Notes and the Exchangeable Notes, respectively. In connection with these repurchases, we recognized a $0.2 million of net loss for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRecent Developments\nAll Other. All other net sales remained constant at $0.2 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nIn January 2014, our Audit Committee commenced an independent investigation that resulted in the Restatement. In March, 2014, we voluntarily reported to the SEC that our Audit Committee had determined that we incorrectly recognized revenue on certain transactions and as a result would restate our financial statements, and that our Audit Committee had commenced an independent investigation.\n \u2022 we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful for investors, among other reasons, to assess the Company's period-to-period core operating performance and to understand and assess the manner in which management analyzes operating performance. \nSee the footnotes to the table below for further information regarding these items. We present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our performance because:\nSee Note 1 \u201cBusiness, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report, for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nIn contrast to completely fabless semiconductor companies, our internal manufacturing capacity provides us with greater control over manufacturing costs and the ability to implement process and production improvements for our internally manufactured products, which can favorably impact gross profit margins. Our internal manufacturing capacity also allows for better control over delivery schedules, improved consistency over product quality and reliability and improved ability to protect intellectual property from misappropriation on these products. However, having internal manufacturing capacity exposes us to the risk of under-utilization of manufacturing capacity that results in lower gross profit margins, particularly during downturns in the semiconductor industry.\n (b) This adjustment eliminates the charges related to the reduction of workforce through the Headcount Reduction Plan in the first half of 2017 and the Program in the second quarter of 2016. As these termination related charges are recorded as a result of implementing the company-wide headcount reduction and are not expected to represent ongoing operating expenses to us, we believe our operating performance results are more usefully compared if these expenses are excluded.

</tr>\n</table>", "summary": " Here are the key points from the MD&A report:\n\n- MagnaChip Semiconductor is a designer and manufacturer of analog and mixed-signal semiconductor products. Its two business segments are Foundry Services Group and Standard Products Group. \n\n- Net sales were $750.9 million in 2018, up 10.5% from $679.7 million in 2017, primarily due to increased revenue from the Standard Products Group offset by decreased revenue from the Foundry Services Group.\n\n- Gross profit was $198.1 million (26.4% of net sales) in 2018, up from $187.9 million (27.6% of net sales) in 2017.
