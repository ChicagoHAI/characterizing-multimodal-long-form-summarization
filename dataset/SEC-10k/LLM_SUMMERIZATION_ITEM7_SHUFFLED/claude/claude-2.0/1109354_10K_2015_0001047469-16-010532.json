The impact of changes in foreign currency translation rates and divestitures in our former Chemical and Applied Markets (CAM) Division, offset by our recent acquisition of Jordan Valley Semiconductors, Ltd., caused a decline of $221.5 million, or 12.3%. Excluding these items, revenue increased 2.1%, which was driven by growth in the Bruker CALID Group, Bruker Nano Group and BEST Segment. Revenue growth in these operating segments was offset by a decline in the Bruker BioSpin Group, as discussed in further detail below within Results of Operations.\nOur gross profit margin increased to 43.6% from 42.2% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily caused by the positive impact of recent operational improvement initiatives, product pricing, outsourcing of various manufacturing activities, the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency translation rates and recent divestiture and restructuring actions. These factors are further discussed below within Results of Operations. Selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development costs during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 decreased by approximately $87.3 million from the prior year, which was caused by the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency translation rates and recent divestiture and restructuring actions.\nEarnings per share increased $0.27 to $0.60 per diluted share in the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014. The increase was attributable to operating profit improvements and a favorable effective tax rate due to the release of valuation allowances on certain U.S. deferred tax assets.\nIn the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we generated $195.0 million in free cash flow. We calculate free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities of $229.2 million less purchases of property, plant and equipment of $34.2 million. Our free cash flow was primarily driven by the higher operating results and reduction in working capital as we progress with our operational improvement initiatives. The time elapsed between the date customer orders are taken, deposits from the customers are received, and our receipt of full payments for the orders can fluctuate significantly from period to period. This cycle had a significantly positive effect on our free cash flow generation in 2015.\nAs previously disclosed, we commenced a restructuring initiative in 2015 within the Bruker BioSpin Group, which was developed as a result of a revenue decline that occurred during the second half of 2014 and continued during the first half of 2015. This initiative is intended to improve Bruker BioSpin Group's operating results. Restructuring actions are expected to result in a reduction of employee headcount within the Bruker BioSpin Group of approximately 9%. Restructuring expenses related to this initiative recorded during the year ended December 31, 2015 were $14.1 million, consisting of $2.1 million for inventory write-downs and $12.0 million of severance and exit costs. The restructuring also includes the closure and consolidation of certain Bruker BioSpin manufacturing facilities. We performed an evaluation during the year ended December 31, 2015 and determined that certain property, plant and equipment were impaired and recorded an impairment charge of $2.1 million to reduce those assets to fair value. Total restructuring and other one-time charges related to this initiative continuing into 2016 are expected to be between $3 and $5 million, which all relate to employee separation and facility exit costs. We expect to generate approximately $10 million in annualized savings when this restructuring initiative is completed by the end of the first quarter in 2016. Prior restructuring initiatives have been executed as planned and there have been no material changes to initially recorded liabilities other than payments.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we outsourced our pension plan in Switzerland to an outside insurance provider, made certain plan design changes, and remeasured the pension liability. As a result, non-cash pension expenses in 2015 increased by approximately $16.0 million, which included a one-time, non-cash settlement charge of $10.2 million recorded in the first quarter of 2015 as the plan assets and pension obligations for the retirees and other certain members of the population were transferred to an outside insurance provider. The settlement charge was recorded as a component of Other Charges, net in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income (loss).\nWe can experience quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in our operating results as a result of various factors, some of which are outside of our control, such as:\n\u2022 the timing of governmental stimulus programs and academic research budgets;\n\u2022 the time it takes between the date customer orders and deposits are received, systems are shipped and accepted by our customers and full payment is received;\n\u2022 the time it takes for customers to construct or prepare their facilities for our products; and\n\u2022 the time required to obtain governmental licenses.\nThese factors have in the past affected the amount and timing of revenue recognized on sales of our products and receipt of related payments and will continue to do so in the future. Accordingly, our operating results in any particular quarter may not necessarily be an indication of any future quarter's operating performance.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear Ended December 31, 2015

million, compared to $1,808.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Included in\nrevenue was a decrease of approximately $184.4 million from the impact of foreign currency translation caused by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus the Euro, Japanese Yen and other currencies, and a decrease of approximately $37.1 million attributable to divestitures, which was partially offset by the acquisition of Jordan Valley Semiconductors, Ltd. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation and our recent acquisitions and divestitures, revenue increased by $36.4 million, or 2.1%.\nBSI Segment revenue decreased by $175.4 million, or 10.5%, to $1,499.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $1,674.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. BEST Segment revenue decreased by $19.2 million, or 12.6%, to $133.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $152.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nPlease see the Segment Results section later in this section for additional discussion of our revenue.\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $708.6 million, resulting in a gross profit margin of 43.6%, compared to $763.3 million, resulting in a gross profit margin of 42.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2014. Included in gross profit were various charges for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs totaling $42.4 million and $44.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Excluding these charges, our gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 46.2% and 44.7%, respectively. The higher gross profit margin is primarily attributable to the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency translation rates, the increased business volume in certain product lines, the favorable impact of recent operational improvement initiatives, product pricing within the Bruker BioSpin Group, outsourcing of various manufacturing activities, and recent divestiture and restructuring actions, including, among others, those within our former CAM Division.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased to $392.2 million, or 24.2% of revenue, from $451.0 million, or 24.9% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency translation rates and divestitures within our former CAM Division.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased to $145.7 million, or 9.0% of revenue, from $174.2 million, or 9.6% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was attributable to the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency translation rates, recent divestitures and restructuring actions, primarily within our former CAM Division, lower material costs and improved efficiency of our product development processes.\nImpairment of Assets\nWe recorded an impairment charge of $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, comprised of goodwill, definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets of $0.7 million, $1.8 million and $2.1 million, respectively, related to the restructuring actions within the Bruker BioSpin Group during the year.\nWe recorded an impairment charge of $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, comprising definite-lived intangible asset and other long-lived assets of $0.9 million and $5.5 million, respectively, relating to our former CAM Division due to restructuring and divestiture actions, and an impairment charge of $5.1 million within our BEST Segment to reduce the carrying value of certain\nlong-lived assets to their fair value due to the projected cash flows of those assets not expected to be sufficient to recover their carrying value.\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, we performed our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment evaluation and concluded the fair values of each of our reporting units were significantly greater than their carrying amounts, and therefore, no additional impairment is required.\nWe will continue to monitor goodwill and long-lived intangible assets, as well as long-lived tangible assets, for possible future impairment.\nOther Charges, Net\nOther charges, net of $20.4 million recorded in 2015 are almost entirely related to the BSI Segment. The charges consisted primarily of a $10.2 million one-time, non-cash settlement charge as the plan assets and pension obligations for the retirees and other certain members of the population within our pension plan in Switzerland were transferred to an outside insurance provider, $8.1 million of restructuring costs related to closing facilities and implementing outsourcing and other restructuring initiatives and $8.9 million of costs associated with our global information technology (IT) transformation initiative, partially offset by ($7.2) million of contingent consideration reversals as it was determined that certain financial targets related to the applicable products would not meet the required thresholds for payment.\nOther charges, net of $21.2 million recorded in 2014 related to the BSI Segment. The charges consisted of $11.1 million of restructuring costs related to closing facilities and implementing outsourcing and other restructuring initiatives, $3.2 million of legal and other professional service fees associated with our internal investigation and review of our operations in China, $2.9 million of acquisition-related costs and $4.0 million of costs associated with our global IT transformation initiative.\nIn 2016, we expect to incur $6-$8 million of expense related to various outsourcing initiatives and other restructuring activities that were implemented in 2015 or will commence in 2016.\nOperating Income\nOperating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $145.7 million, resulting in an operating margin of 9.0%, compared to income from operations of $105.4 million, resulting in an operating margin of 5.8% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Operating income included restructuring costs of $29.3 million and $36.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which were related to closing facilities and implementing outsourcing and other restructuring initiatives.\nOperating income also included $40.2 million and $42.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for various charges for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs, legal and other professional service fees related to our internal investigation and review of our operations in China, impairment of long-lived assets, and costs associated with our global IT transformation initiative. Excluding the charges noted above, operating margins were 13.3% and 10.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in operating margin was caused by the improvements in gross profit margins and reduction of operating expenses as discussed above.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net\nInterest and other income (expense), net during the year ended December 31, 2015 was ($17.7) million, compared to ($4.1) million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, the major components within interest and other income (expense), net were net interest expense of $11.8 million and realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency denominated transactions of $5.5 million. The realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency denominated transactions during the year ended December 31, 2015 were primarily caused by the fluctuations of the U.S. dollar, the Euro and the Swiss Franc. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the major components within interest and other income (expense), net were net interest expense of $12.5 million, a settlement charge related to the review of our operations in China of $2.4 million and realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency transactions of $2.0 million. These expenses were partially offset by gains on the sale of product lines of $8.3 million, driven by the divestiture of product lines within the former CAM Division noted above, an insurance claim reimbursement of $2.5 million and an incentive from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts of $1.1 million.\nWe expect to incur approximately $13.5 million of interest expense in 2016.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $23.1 million compared to an income tax provision of $41.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, representing effective tax rates of 18.0% and 41.2%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to a partial release of U.S. valuation allowances previously recorded against deferred tax assets, and by changes in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions. Our valuation allowance at December 31, 2015 decreased $20.2 million as compared to December 31, 2014, including a reduction to the beginning of the year valuation allowance of $20.8 million, to account for a change in judgment with respect to the realizability of our U.S. deferred tax assets. This decrease was primarily attributable to U.S. net operating loss and foreign tax credit usage as a result of the repatriation of $235.3 million of foreign earnings to the United States during 2015 prompted by adverse interest rate conditions in Europe that were unfavorably impacting cash balances. Among the evidence supporting our conclusion with respect to the realizability of these deferred tax assets was the elimination of recent cumulative U.S. losses as well as expected future near term U.S. taxable income. Our tax rate may change over time as the amount and mix of jurisdictional income changes.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $3.3 million compared to $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the minority shareholders' proportionate share of the net income recorded by our majority-owned indirect subsidiaries.\nNet Income Attributable to Bruker Corporation\nOur net income attributable to Bruker Corporation for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $101.6 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, compared to net income of $56.7 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, for 2014. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily caused by increased operating income and a favorable effective tax rate as discussed above.\nSegment Results\nRevenue\nThe following table presents revenue, change in revenue, and revenue growth by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in millions):\nTable 12: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>Dollar Change </th> <th> </th> <th>Percentage\nChange </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BSI\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,499.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,674.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(175.4 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (10.5 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BEST\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>133.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>152.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19.2 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (12.6 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Eliminations (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.1 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(18.6 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>9.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,623.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,808.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(185.1 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (10.2 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)Represents product and service revenue between reportable segments.\nBSI Segment Revenues\nFor financial reporting purposes, we aggregate the Bruker BioSpin, Bruker CALID and Bruker Nano operating segments into the Bruker Scientific Instruments (BSI) reportable segment, which represented approximately 92% of the Company's revenues during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. This aggregation reflects these operating segments' similar economic characteristics, production processes, customer services provided, types and classes of customers, methods of distribution and regulatory environments. Our BEST Segment is our other reportable segment and represents the remainder of our revenues.\nBSI Segment revenue decreased by $175.4 million, or 10.5%, to $1,499.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $1,674.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Included in revenue was a decrease of approximately $160.9 million from the impact of foreign currency translation caused by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus the Euro, Japanese Yen and other currencies and a decrease of approximately $37.1 million attributable to the divestiture of the former CAM Division, partially offset by the acquisition of Jordan Valley, Semiconductors, Ltd. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation and our recent acquisitions and divestitures, revenue increased by $22.6 million, or 1.3%, as further discussed below.\nExcluding the effect of foreign currency translation, Bruker BioSpin Group revenue decreased $20.6 million, or 3.3%, to $602.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $622.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The Bruker BioSpin Group decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to a decline in revenue for MRI, Molecular Imaging (MI) and EPR products, which was partially offset by increased sales of NMR products predominantly in the second half of 2015. The increase in sales of NMR products of $54.2 million resulted from increased levels of new order bookings over the comparable period in 2014. In addition, the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 benefited from the recognition of a significant 21 Tesla high-field magnet sale.\nExcluding the effect of foreign currency translation and our recent acquisitions and divestitures, Bruker CALID Group revenue increased by $37.8 million, or 7.4%, to $591.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $553.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The Bruker CALID Group experienced higher revenue levels for certain mass spectrometry products (primarily MALDI-TOF and MALDI Biotyper) caused primarily by strong underlying academic, pharma, biotech and contract research markets. CBRNE products sales were higher as a result of certain large orders and newly launched explosive trace detection products sold to European airports. The increase in revenue was partially offset by a decline in sales of MIR products caused by weaker demand in end markets.\nExcluding the effect of foreign currency translation and our recent acquisitions and divestitures, Bruker Nano Group revenue increased by $5.5 million, or 1.1%, to $503.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $498.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The Bruker Nano Group experienced an increase in revenue levels in the X-ray diffraction, single crystal X-ray diffraction, and electron microscope analyzer markets, which was partially offset by a decrease in revenue caused by continued weakness in the semiconductor, data storage and industrial markets. Improvements in commercial processes, such as improved sales forecasting resulting in better production planning, improved understanding of customer site readiness and better scheduling of installation services also contributed to the sales increase.\nSystem revenue and aftermarket revenue as a percentage of total BSI Segment revenue were as follows during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in millions):\nTable 13: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Revenue </th> <th> </th> <th>Percentage of\nSegment Revenue </th> <th> </th> <th>Revenue </th> <th> </th> <th>Percentage of\nSegment Revenue </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> System revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,119.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,316.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Aftermarket revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>379.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>358.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,499.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,674.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSystem revenue in the BSI Segment included nuclear magnetic resonance systems, magnetic resonance imaging systems, electron paramagnetic imaging systems, mass spectrometry systems, gas chromatography systems, CBRNE detection systems, X-ray systems, spark-optical emission spectroscopy systems, atomic force microscopy systems, stylus and optical metrology systems, molecular spectroscopy systems and other systems. Aftermarket revenues in the BSI Segment include accessory sales, consumables, training and services.\nBEST Segment Revenues\nBEST Segment revenue decreased by $19.2 million, or 12.6%, to $133.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $152.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decline in revenue was primarily caused by the impact of changes in foreign currency translation, which was partially offset by increases resulting from the completion of the ROSATOM pilot line and the timing of certain large orders.\nSystem and wire revenue and aftermarket revenue as a percentage of total BEST Segment revenue were as follows during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in millions):\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Revenue </th> <th> </th> <th>Percentage of\nSegment Revenue </th> <th> </th> <th>Revenue </th> <th> </th> <th>Percentage of\nSegment Revenue </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> System and wire revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>129.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>148.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Aftermarket revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>133.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>152.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSystem and wire revenue in the BEST Segment includes low and high temperature superconducting wire and superconducting devices, including magnets, linear accelerators and radio frequency cavities. Aftermarket revenues in the BEST Segment consist primarily of license revenue and consumables sales.\nGross Profit and Operating Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, gross profit margin in the BSI Segment increased to 45.5% from 43.7% in the comparable period in 2014. The increase in gross profit margin percentage was primarily caused by the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency translation rates and the positive impact of higher business volume in certain product lines, recent operational improvement initiatives, increased product pricing, outsourcing of various manufacturing activities, and recent divestiture and restructuring activities. The BEST Segment gross profit margin increased to 19.5% from 18.8% for the comparable period in 2014. Higher gross margins resulted primarily from the completion of certain large projects during the year and from changes in foreign currency translation rates.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses in the BSI Segment decreased to $524.2 million, or 35.0% of segment revenue, from $604.8 million, or 36.1% of segment revenue, for the comparable period in 2014. The decrease reflected the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency and recent divestiture and restructuring actions within the former CAM Division. Selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses in the BEST Segment decreased to $13.7 million, or 10.2% of segment revenue, in 2015 compared to $20.4 million, or 13.3% of segment revenue, in 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to the reduction in operating expenses and the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency.\nOperating Income\nThe following table presents operating income and operating margins on revenue by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in millions):\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Operating\nIncome </th> <th> </th> <th>Percentage of\nSegment Revenue </th> <th> </th> <th>Operating\nIncome </th> <th> </th> <th>Percentage of\nSegment Revenue </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BSI\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>133.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>99.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BEST\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate, eliminations and other (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>145.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>105.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)Represents corporate costs and eliminations not allocated to the reportable segments.\nBSI operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $133.2 million, resulting in an operating margin of 8.9%, compared to income from operations of $99.8 million, resulting in an operating margin of 6.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2014. Income from operations included $68.4 million and $73.7 million in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, of various charges representing amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs, legal and other professional fees related to our internal investigation and review of our operations in China, restructuring and relocation costs, impairment of definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets, and costs associated with our global IT transformation initiative. Excluding these costs, operating income for BSI was $201.6 million and $173.5 million, resulting in operating margins of 13.4% and 10.4%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Increases in operating margins were primarily caused by higher gross margin levels and lower operating expenses as discussed above.\nBEST operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $11.5 million, resulting in an operating margin of 8.6%, compared to operating income of $3.4 million, resulting in an operating margin of 2.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in operating margin is primarily the result of the increased gross margins as a result of the completion of certain large orders during the year.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to

2013. Included in revenue was a decrease of approximately $25.4 million from the impact of foreign currency translation caused by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus the Japanese Yen, Russian Ruble and other currencies, and an increase of approximately $2.9 million attributable to recent acquisitions and divestitures. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation and our recent acquisitions and divestitures, revenue decreased by $8.0 million, or 0.4%.\nBSI Segment revenue decreased by $34.9 million, or 2.0%, to $1,674.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $1,709.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. BEST Segment revenue increased by $5.5 million, or 3.7%, to $152.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $147.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nPlease see the Segment Results section later in this section for additional discussion of our revenue.\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $763.3 million, resulting in a gross profit margin of 42.2%, compared to $805.2 million, resulting in a gross profit margin of 43.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2013. Included in gross profit were various charges for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs totaling $44.4 million and $27.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Excluding these charges, our gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 44.7% and 45.3%, respectively. The lower gross profit margin was primarily driven by the negative effects of foreign currency translation rates, including the impact of the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus the Japanese Yen, as our Yen denominated revenues substantially exceeded our Yen denominated expenses. In addition, 2013 gross profit margin benefited from license revenue recognized on the sale of technology in the BEST Segment, which had no cost of revenue. These effects were partially offset by favorable changes in the mix of products sold during 2014, including a 21 Tesla high-field magnet that benefited from higher gross profit margins.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased to $451.0 million, or 24.9% of revenue, from $437.9 million, or 23.8% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to: increased sales and marketing spending, particularly in our former LSC Division for our MALDI Biotyper product; the hiring of new senior management; general and administrative spending related to certain investments including financial reporting system improvements and strategic advisory services; higher allowance for doubtful accounts including amounts associated with certain distributor arrangements in Asia; and expenses relating to recent acquisitions. The increases were partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency translation rates.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased to $174.2 million, or 9.6% of revenue, from $190.5 million, or 10.4% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in research and development expenses was attributable to our efforts to improve the efficiency of our product development process.\nImpairment of Assets\nThe Company recorded an impairment charge of $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, comprising definite-lived intangible asset and other long-lived assets of $0.9 million and $5.5 million, respectively, relating to our former CAM Division caused by restructuring and divestiture actions, and an impairment charge of $5.1 million within our BEST Segment to reduce the carrying value of certain long-lived assets to their fair value caused by the projected cash flows of those assets not expected to be sufficient to recover their carrying value.\nAt December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company performed its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment evaluation by performing a qualitative assessment and concluded that it is\nmore-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting units are greater than their carrying amount, and therefore, no additional impairment is required.\nNo impairment losses were recorded related to definite-lived intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2013.\nOther Charges, Net\nOther charges, net of $21.2 million recorded in 2014 related to the BSI Segment. The charges consisted of $11.1 million of restructuring costs related to closing facilities and implementing outsourcing and other restructuring initiatives, $3.2 million of legal and other professional service fees associated with our internal investigation and review of our operations in China, $2.9 million of acquisition-related costs and $4.0 million of costs associated with the initial stages of a global IT transformation initiative.\nOther charges, net of $28.6 million recorded in 2013 related primarily to the BSI Segment. The charges consist of $18.2 million of restructuring costs, including $15.9 million within the BSI Segment and $2.3 million within the BEST Segment, related to closing facilities and implementing outsourcing and other restructuring initiatives, $6.1 million of legal and other professional service fees associated with our internal investigation and review of our operations in China, $3.6 million of acquisition-related costs and $0.7 million related to two factory relocations within the BEST Segment.\nOperating Income\nOperating income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $105.4 million, resulting in an operating margin of 5.8%, compared to income from operations of $148.2 million, resulting in an operating margin of 8.1% for the year ended December 31, 2013. Operating income included restructuring costs of $36.1 million and $25.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, related to closing facilities and implementing outsourcing and other restructuring initiatives.\nOperating income also included $42.9 million and $32.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, for various charges for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs, legal and other professional service fees related to our internal investigation and review of our operations in China, impairment of long-lived assets and costs associated with a global information technology transformation initiative. Excluding the charges noted above, operating margins were 10.2% and 11.2% for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decline in operating margin was driven by the negative effect caused by changes in foreign currency translation rates.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net\nInterest and other income (expense), net during the year ended December 31, 2014 was ($4.1) million, compared to ($23.6) million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, the major components within interest and other income (expense), net were net interest expense of $12.5 million, a settlement charge related to the review of our operations in China of $2.4 million and realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency transactions of $2.0 million. These expenses were partially offset by gains on the sale of product lines of $8.3 million driven by the divestiture of product lines within the former CAM Division noted above, an insurance claim reimbursement of $2.5 million, and an incentive from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts of $1.1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2013, the major components within interest and other income (expense), net were net interest expense of $12.4 million and realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency transactions of $10.4 million.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $41.7 million compared to an income tax provision of $42.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, representing effective tax rates of 41.2% and 34.3%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily caused by unbenefited losses associated with the actions at our former CAM Division. That impact was offset slightly by changes in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions. Our income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 reflects amounts for non-U.S. entities only as we maintained a full valuation allowance against all U.S. deferred tax assets, including our U.S. net operating losses and tax credits, until evidence existed that it is more likely than not that the loss carryforward and credit amounts will be utilized to offset U.S. taxable income.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $2.9 million compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the minority shareholders' proportionate share of the net income recorded by our majority-owned indirect subsidiaries.\nNet Income Attributable to Bruker Corporation\nOur net income attributable to Bruker Corporation for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $56.7 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, compared to net income of $80.1 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, for 2013. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily caused by lower gross margin levels and a higher effective tax rate, partially offset by gains on the sale of product lines in 2014.\nSegment Results\nRevenue\nThe following table presents revenue, change in revenue and revenue growth by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in millions):\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> <th>Dollar Change </th> <th> </th> <th>Percentage\nChange </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BSI\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,674.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,709.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(34.9 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (2.0 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BEST\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>152.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>147.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Eliminations (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(18.6 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(17.5 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.1 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,808.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,839.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(30.5 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (1.7 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)Represents product and service revenue between reportable segments.\nBSI Segment Revenues\nBSI Segment revenue decreased by $34.9 million, or 2.0%, to $1,674.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $1,709.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Included in revenue was a decrease of approximately $25.5 million from the impact of foreign currency translation caused by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus the Japanese Yen, Russian Ruble and other currencies, and an increase of approximately $2.9 million attributable to recent acquisitions and divestitures. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation and our recent acquisitions and divestitures, revenue decreased by $12.3 million, or 0.7%.\nBruker BioSpin Group revenue decreased $1.6 million, or 0.3%, to $622.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $624.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Bruker BioSpin Group revenue reflected lower sales caused by reduced orders of NMR systems from governmental and academic research customers, partially offset by the recognition of revenue on the sale of a 21 Tesla high-field magnet and higher sales of MRI, MI and EPR products.\nBruker CALID Group revenue decreased by $27.9 million, or 4.8%, to $553.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $581.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in revenue was driven by declines in the former CAM Division, in part due to the divestiture and restructuring actions during the third and fourth quarters of 2014, and delays in obtaining export licenses related to certain CBRNE orders. These declines were partially offset by increased sales of the MALDI Biotyper and MIR and NIR product lines.\nBruker Nano Group revenue decreased by $5.4 million, or 1.1%, to $498.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $503.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The principal drivers of this decline were: continued weakness in end market demand for semiconductor, data storage and microelectronics products; the pricing advantage our Japanese based competitors have resulting from the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar and Euro against the Japanese Yen; and reduced demand from customers in Russia as a result of the geopolitical uncertainty in the region. These declines were partially offset by revenue generated from the recently acquired line of fluorescence microscopy products.\nSystem revenue and aftermarket revenue as a percentage of total BSI Segment revenue were as follows during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in millions):\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Revenue </th> <th> </th> <th>Percentage of\nSegment\nRevenue </th> <th> </th> <th>Revenue </th> <th> </th> <th>Percentage of\nSegment\nRevenue </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> System revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,316.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,385.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Aftermarket revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>358.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>324.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,674.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,709.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSystem revenue in the BSI Segment includes nuclear magnetic resonance systems, magnetic resonance imaging systems, electron paramagnetic imaging systems, mass spectrometry systems, gas chromatography systems, CBRNE detection systems, X-ray systems, spark-optical emission spectroscopy systems, atomic force microscopy systems, stylus and optical metrology systems, molecular spectroscopy systems, fluorescent microscopy and other systems. Aftermarket revenues in the BSI Segment include accessory sales, consumables, training and services.\nBEST Segment Revenues\nBEST Segment revenue increased by $5.5 million, or 3.7%, to $152.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $147.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to higher sales of cavity devices, which more than offset the 2013 license revenue recognized on the sale of technology.\nSystem and wire revenue and aftermarket revenue as a percentage of total BEST Segment revenue were as follows during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in millions):\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Revenue </th> <th> </th> <th>Percentage of\nSegment\nRevenue </th> <th> </th> <th>Revenue </th> <th> </th> <th>Percentage of\nSegment\nRevenue </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> System and wire revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>148.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>137.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Aftermarket and other revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>152.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>147.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSystem and wire revenue in the BEST Segment includes low and high temperature superconducting wire and superconducting devices, including magnets, linear accelerators and radio frequency cavities. Aftermarket revenues in the BEST Segment consist primarily of license revenue and consumables sales.\nGross Profit and Operating Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, gross profit margin in the BSI Segment decreased to 43.7% from 45.3% in the comparable period in 2013. Lower gross profit margins resulted primarily from restructuring charges recorded during the year ended December 31, 2014 related to closing facilities and implementing outsourcing and other restructuring initiatives, and the negative effect of foreign currency translation rates, including the impact of the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus the Japanese Yen. These declines were partially offset by an increase caused by changes in the mix of products sold, including a 21 Tesla high-field magnet that benefited from higher gross margins. The BEST Segment gross profit margin decreased to 18.8% from 21.5% for the comparable period in 2013. Lower gross margins resulted primarily from license revenue recognized in 2013 on the sale of technology which had no cost of revenue.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses in the BSI Segment decreased to $604.8 million, or 36.1% of segment revenue, from $609.1 million, or 35.6% of segment revenue, for the comparable period in 2013. The decrease in dollars reflects lower research and development expense attributable to our efforts to improve the efficiency of our product development process. This decrease was offset by: higher sales and marketing spending, particularly for our MALDI Biotyper product; the hiring of new senior management; general and administrative spending related to certain investments including financial reporting system improvement and strategic advisory services; higher allowance for doubtful accounts including amounts associated with certain distributor arrangements in Asia; and expenses caused by recent acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by the effect of changes in foreign currency translation rates. The increase as a percentage of revenue was caused by lower revenue levels in 2014. Selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses in the BEST Segment remained relatively consistent at $20.4 million, or 13.3% of segment revenue, in 2014 compared to $19.3 million, or 13.1% of segment revenue, in 2013.\nOperating Income\nThe following table presents operating income and operating margins on revenue by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in millions):\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Operating\nIncome </th> <th> </th> <th>Percentage of\nSegment\nRevenue </th> <th> </th> <th>Operating\nIncome </th> <th> </th> <th>Percentage of\nSegment\nRevenue </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BSI\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>99.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>138.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BEST\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>9.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate, eliminations and other (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.2 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>105.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>148.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)Represents corporate costs and eliminations not allocated to the reportable segments.\nBSI operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $99.8 million, resulting in an operating margin of 6.0%, compared to income from operations of $138.9 million, resulting in an operating margin of 8.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2013. Income from operations included $73.7 million and $54.1 million in the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, of various charges representing amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs, legal and other professional fees related to our internal investigation and review of our operations in China, restructuring and relocation costs, impairment of definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets and costs associated with a global IT transformation initiative. Excluding these costs, operating income for BSI was $173.5 million and $193.0 million, resulting in operating margins of 10.4% and 11.3%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. Operating income, excluding these costs, decreased as a result of the negative effect of changes in foreign currency translation rates, including the impact the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus the Japanese Yen as our Yen denominated revenues substantially exceeded our Yen denominated expenses, lower gross margin levels and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in research and development expenses.\nBEST operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $3.4 million, resulting in an operating margin of 2.2%, compared to operating income of $9.5 million, resulting in an operating margin of 6.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decline in operating margin was the result of license revenue recognized in 2013 on the sale of technology which had no cost of revenue that did not recur, and impairment charges of $5.1 million recorded in 2014 to reduce the carrying value of certain long-lived assets to their estimated fair value.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe currently anticipate that our existing cash and credit facilities will be sufficient to support our operating and investing needs for at least the next twelve months. Our future cash requirements could be affected by acquisitions that we may make, repurchases of our common stock, or the payment of dividends in the future. Historically, we have financed our growth and liquidity needs through cash flow generation and a combination of debt financings and issuances of common stock. In the future, there are no assurances that additional financing alternatives will be available to us, if required, or if available, will be obtained on terms favorable to us.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $229.2 million, resulting primarily from consolidated net income adjusted for non-cash items of $182.9 million, and a decrease in working capital of $46.3 million. The decrease in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily caused by improved efficiency in accounts receivable\ncollections and an increase in income taxes payable caused, in part by, additional withholding taxes on repatriated funds. The time elapsed between the date customer orders are taken, deposits from the customers are received, and our receipt of full payments for the orders can fluctuate significantly from period to period. This cycle had a significantly positive effect on our free cash flow generation in 2015.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by operating activities was $114.3 million, which resulted primarily from consolidated net income adjusted for non-cash items of $153.6 million, partially offset by an increase in working capital of $39.3 million. The increase in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in customer advances as the timing between receipt of customer acceptances, such as obtaining acceptance during the year on a 21 Tesla high-field magnet in the Bruker BioSpin Group and completion of certain orders in the BEST Segment which had relatively large customer advances, and advance payments on new orders received, varied. In addition, there was an increase in accounts receivable caused by higher shipment levels towards the end of the fourth quarter of 2014. These uses of cash were partially offset by cash generated through an increase in accounts payable driven by improved vendor payment practices.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $102.4 million, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $201.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. Cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily caused by purchases, net of maturities, of short-term investments of $40.7 million, capital expenditures of $34.2 million and cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $28.6 million. Cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily caused by purchases, net of maturities, of short-term investments of $192.6 million and capital expenditures of $33.8 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of product lines of $25.3 million.\nWe expect capital expenditures in 2016 to amount to approximately $50 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in financing activities was $168.0 million, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $6.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. Cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily caused by the repayment of the revolving line of credit from the proceeds of the repatriation of certain non U.S. cash, net of additional proceeds of $87.5 million, and repurchases of common stock of $90.0 million, partially offset by the issuance of common stock in connection with stock option exercises of $10.8 million. Cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily caused by proceeds of $7.9 million from the issuance of common stock in connection with stock option exercises, partially offset by repayment of debt of $0.8 million.\nIn May 2015, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program (the \"Anti-Dilutive Repurchase Program\") under which we were authorized to repurchase our common stock in amounts intended to approximately offset, on an annual basis, the dilutive effect of shares that are, or may be, issued pursuant to option or restricted stock awards under our 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan. A total of 1,245,000 shares were repurchased at an aggregate cost of $24.9 million prior to the suspension of the Anti-Dilutive Repurchase Program in November 2015, as discussed below.\nIn November 2015, our Board of Directors suspended the Anti-Dilutive Repurchase Program until January 1, 2017 and approved an additional share repurchase program (the \"Repurchase Program\") under which repurchases of common stock in the amount of up to $225 million may occur from time to time, in amounts, at prices, and at such times as we deem appropriate, subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other considerations. A total of 2,837,042 shares were repurchased at an aggregate cost of $65.0 million as of December 31, 2015 under this Repurchase Program. The Repurchase Program will continue in 2016 and we intend to fund any additional repurchases from cash on hand, future cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nThe repurchased shares are reflected within Treasury stock in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015.\nDuring 2015, we repatriated $235.3 million of foreign earnings to the United States prompted by adverse interest rate conditions in Europe that were unfavorably impacting cash balances. No incremental U.S. income tax was incurred as the majority of the repatriation was comprised of previously taxed income and we had sufficient U.S. net operating losses and tax credits to offset any remaining tax liability. We used $129.5 million of the repatriated funds to repay our outstanding balance on the revolving credit line under the Amended Credit Agreement.\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at December 31, 2015 and 2014 totaled $468.3 million and $497.5 million, respectively, of which $420.9 million and $460.7 million, respectively, related to cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside of the U.S. in our foreign subsidiaries, most significantly in the Netherlands and Switzerland.\nWe regularly evaluate our assertion that our foreign earnings are indefinitely reinvested. If the cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries are needed to fund operations in the U.S., or we otherwise elect to repatriate the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries in the form of dividends or otherwise, or if the shares of the subsidiaries were sold or transferred, we would likely be subject to additional U.S. income taxes, net of the impact of any available tax credits, which could result in a higher effective tax rate in the future. Based on our current plans and anticipated cash needs to fund our U.S. operations, it is our current intent to indefinitely reinvest all unremitted foreign earnings, that have not been previously taxed by the U.S., in our foreign subsidiaries.\nIn May 2011, we entered into an amendment to, and restatement of, our then existing credit agreement, referred to as the Amended Credit Agreement. The Amended Credit Agreement provided a maximum commitment on our revolving credit line of $250.0 million and a maturity date of May 2016. Borrowings under the revolving credit line of the Amended Credit Agreement accrued interest, at our option, at either (a) the greater of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (iii) adjusted LIBOR plus 1.00% or (b) LIBOR, plus margins ranging from 0.80% to 1.65%. There was also a facility fee ranging from 0.20% to 0.35%. The Amended Credit Agreement was repaid in full in October 2015, as noted above.\nOn October 27, 2015, we entered into a new revolving credit agreement, referred to as the 2015 Credit Agreement, and terminated the Amended Credit Agreement. The 2015 Credit Agreement provides a maximum commitment on the Company's revolving credit line of $500 million and a maturity date of October 2020. Borrowings under the revolving credit line of the 2015 Credit Agreement accrue interest, at the Company's option, at either (a) the greater of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (iii) adjusted LIBOR plus 1.00%, plus margins ranging from 0.00% to 0.30% or (b) LIBOR, plus margins ranging from 0.90% to 1.30%. There is also a facility fee ranging from 0.10% to 0.20%.\nBorrowings under the 2015 Credit Agreement are secured by guarantees from certain material subsidiaries, as defined in the 2015 Credit Agreement. The 2015 Credit Agreement also requires the Company to maintain certain financial ratios related to maximum leverage and minimum interest coverage (as defined in the 2015 Credit Agreement). Specifically, the Company's leverage ratio cannot exceed 3.5 and the Company's interest coverage ratio cannot be less than 2.5. In addition to the financial ratios, the 2015 Credit Agreement contains negative covenants, including among others, restrictions on liens, indebtedness of the Company and its subsidiaries, asset sales, dividends and transactions with affiliates. Failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the terms of the 2015 Credit Agreement, which could permit acceleration of the debt and require the Company to prepay the debt before its scheduled due date.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the covenants of the 2015 Credit Agreement. Our leverage ratio (as defined in the 2015 Credit Agreement) was 1.0 and our interest coverage ratio (as defined in the 2015 Credit Agreement) was 14.9.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had outstanding debt totaling $266.7 million, consisting of $240.0 million outstanding under the Note Purchase Agreement described below, $25.0 million outstanding under the revolving loan component of the 2015 Credit Agreement described above and $1.7 million under capital lease obligations and other loans. At December 31, 2014, we had outstanding debt totaling $355.0 million, consisting of $240.0 million outstanding under the Note Purchase Agreement described below, $112.5 million outstanding under the revolving loan component of the Amended Credit Agreement described above and $2.5 million under capital lease obligations and other loans.\nThe following is a summary of the maximum commitments and net amounts available to the Company as of December 31, 2015 (dollars in millions):\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Weighted\nAverage\nInterest Rate </th> <th> </th> <th>Total Amount\nCommitted\nby Lenders </th> <th> </th> <th>Outstanding\nBorrowings </th> <th> </th> <th>Outstanding\nLetters\nof Credit </th> <th> </th> <th>Total Amount\nAvailable </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2015 Credit Agreement\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>500.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>25.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>474.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other lines of credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>234.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>136.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revolving loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>734.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>25.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>137.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>571.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther lines of credit are with various financial institutions located primarily in Germany and Switzerland. The Company's other revolving lines of credit are unsecured and are typically due upon demand with interest payable monthly.\nIn January 2012, we entered into a note purchase agreement, referred to as the Note Purchase Agreement, with a group of accredited institutional investors. Under the Note Purchase Agreement we issued and sold $240.0 million of senior notes, which consist of the following:\n\u2022 $20.0 million 3.16% Series 2012A senior notes due January 18, 2017;\n\u2022 $15.0 million 3.74% Series 2012A senior notes due January 18, 2019;\n\u2022 $105.0 million 4.31% Series 2012A senior notes due January 18, 2022; and\n\u2022 $100.0 million 4.46% Series 2012A senior notes due January 18, 2024.\nUnder the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, we may issue and sell additional senior notes up to an aggregate principal amount of $600 million, subject to certain conditions. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on January 18 and July 18 of each year. The Senior Notes are unsecured obligations of us and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries. The Senior Notes rank pari passu in right of repayment with our other senior unsecured indebtedness. We may prepay some or all of the Senior Notes at any time in an amount not less than 10% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes to be prepaid, at a price equal to the sum of (a) 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and (b) the applicable make-whole amount, upon not less than 30 and no more than 60 days written notice to the holders of the Senior Notes. In the event of a change in control of the Company, as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement, we may be required to prepay the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nThe Note Purchase Agreement contains affirmative covenants, including, without limitation, maintenance of corporate existence, compliance with laws, maintenance of insurance and properties, payment of taxes, addition of subsidiary guarantors and furnishing notices and other information. The Note Purchase Agreement also contains certain restrictive covenants that restrict our ability to, among\nother things, incur liens, transfer or sell assets, engage in certain mergers and consolidations and enter into transactions with affiliates. The Note Purchase Agreement also includes customary representations and warranties and events of default. In the case of an event of default arising from specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency, all outstanding Senior Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. In the case of payment events of defaults, any holder of Senior Notes affected thereby may declare all Senior Notes held by it due and payable immediately. In the case of any other event of default, a majority of the holders of the Senior Notes may declare all the Senior Notes to be due and payable immediately. Pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, so long as any Senior Notes are outstanding we will not permit (i) our leverage ratio, as determined pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, as of the end of any fiscal quarter to exceed 3.50 to 1.00, (ii) our interest coverage ratio as determined pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement as of the end of any fiscal quarter for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to be less than 2.50 to 1 or (iii) priority debt at any time to exceed 25% of consolidated net worth, as determined pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the covenants of the Note Purchase Agreement. Our leverage ratio (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) was 1.0 and our interest coverage ratio (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) was 14.9.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $3.0 million of net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce state taxable income; approximately $42.4 million of German Trade Tax net operating losses that are carried forward indefinitely; and $42.9 million of other foreign net operating losses that are expected to expire at various times beginning in 2018. We also had U.S. federal tax credits of approximately $27.8 million available to offset future tax liabilities that expire at various dates, which include research and development tax credits of $14.0 million expiring at various times through 2034, foreign tax credits of $13.8 million expiring at various times through 2024, and state research and development tax credits of $7.1 million. Utilization of these credits and state net operating losses may be subject to annual limitations due to the ownership percentage change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code Section 382 and similar state provisions. In the event of a deemed change in control under Internal Revenue Code Section 382, an annual limitation on the utilization of net operating losses and credits may result in the expiration of all or a portion of the net operating loss and credit carryforwards.\nUncertain tax contingencies are positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return that may result in additional payments to tax authorities. The total amount of uncertain tax contingencies is included in the \"1-3 Years\" column of the table below as we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of potential future payments. If a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires, then additional payments will not be necessary.\nThe following table summarizes maturities for our significant financial obligations as of December 31, 2015 (dollars in millions):\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>Contractual Obligations\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Total </th> <th> </th> <th>Less than\n1 Year </th> <th> </th> <th>1-3 Years </th> <th> </th> <th>4-5 Years </th> <th> </th> <th>More than\n5 Years </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revolving lines of credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>25.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>25.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other long-term debt, including current portion\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>241.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>205.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payable on long-term debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unconditional purchase commitments (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>109.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition-related contingent consideration\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pension liabilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Uncertain tax contingencies\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>526.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>108.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>72.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>77.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>268.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Unconditional purchase commitments include agreements to purchase goods, services, or fixed assets that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase commitments exclude agreements that are cancellable at any time without penalty.\nOn February 22, 2016, we announced the establishment of a dividend policy and the declaration by our Board of Directors of an initial quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.04 per share of our issued and outstanding common stock. The dividend will be paid on March 24, 2016 to stockholders of record as of March 4, 2016. Under the dividend policy, we will target a cash dividend to our stockholders in the amount of $0.16 per share per annum, payable in equal quarterly installments. Subsequent dividend declarations and the establishment of record and payment dates for such future dividend payments, if any, are subject our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the dividend policy is in the best interests of our stockholders. The dividend policy may be suspended or cancelled at the discretion of our Board of Directors at any time.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to: revenue recognition; the expensing and capitalization of software development costs; stock-based compensation expense; restructuring and other related charges; income taxes, including the recoverability of deferred tax assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; inventory reductions for excess and obsolete inventories; estimated fair values of long-lived assets used to measure the recoverability of long-lived assets; intangible assets and goodwill; expected future cash flows used to measure the recoverability of intangible assets and long-lived assets; warranty costs; derivative financial instruments; and contingent liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience, current market and economic conditions, industry trends, and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and those that require the most estimation and subjective judgment.\nRevenue recognition. We recognize revenue from system sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, title and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer, and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Title and risk of loss transfers based upon customer acceptance for a system that has been delivered to the customer and installed at a customer facility or, for certain systems, upon shipping terms. For systems that include customer-specific acceptance criteria, we are required to assess when we can demonstrate the acceptance criteria has been met, which generally is upon customer acceptance and evidence of installation.\nWhen products are sold through an independent distributor or a strategic distribution partner who assumes responsibility for installation, we recognize the system sale when the product has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred to the distributor. Our distributors do not have price protection rights or rights of return; however, our products are typically warranted to be free from defect for a period of one year. Revenue is deferred until cash is received when collectability is not reasonably assured or when the price is not fixed or determinable.\nFor transactions that include multiple elements, arrangement consideration is allocated to each element using the fair value hierarchy as required by ASU No. 2009-13. We limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services, future performance obligations, or subject to customer-specific return or refund privileges.\nWe determine the fair value of products and services based upon vendor specific objective evidence (\"VSOE\"). We determine VSOE based on normal selling pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold on a stand-alone basis. In determining VSOE, our policy requires a substantial majority of selling prices for a product or service to be within a reasonably narrow range. We also consider the class of customer, method of distribution and the geographies into which products and services are being sold when determining VSOE.\nIf VSOE cannot be established, we attempt to establish the selling price based on third-party evidence (\"TPE\"). VSOE cannot be established in instances where a product or service has not been sold separately, stand-alone sales are too infrequent or product pricing is not within a sufficiently narrow range. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately.\nWhen we cannot determine VSOE or TPE, we use estimated selling price (\"ESP\") in our allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would typically transact a stand-alone sale of the product or service. ESP is determined by considering a number of factors including our pricing policies, internal costs and gross profit objectives, method of distribution, market research and information, recent technological trends, competitive landscape and geographies. We analyze the selling prices used in our allocation of arrangement consideration, at a minimum, on an annual basis. Selling prices will be analyzed more frequently if a significant change in our business occurs or other factors necessitate more frequent analysis, or if we experience significant variances in our selling prices.\nRevenue from accessories and parts is recognized upon shipment. Service revenue is recognized as the services are performed or ratably over the contractual obligation and includes maintenance contracts, extended warranty, training, application support and on-demand services.\nWe also have contracts for which we apply the percentage-of-completion model and completed contract model of revenue recognition. Application of the percentage-of-completion method requires us to make reasonable estimates of the extent of progress toward completion of the contract and the total costs we will incur under the contract and losses are recorded immediately when we estimate that contracts will ultimately result in a loss. Changes in our estimates could affect the timing of revenue recognition.\nIncome taxes. The determination of income tax expense requires us to make certain estimates and judgments concerning the annual effective tax rate, the calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the forecasted profitability of our subsidiaries in certain geographic jurisdictions, as well as the deductions, carryforwards and credits that are available to reduce taxable income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial statement and tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates in effect for the year in which these temporary differences are expected to be settled. We estimate the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and we provide a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that we believe will more likely than not go unused. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used for which a valuation allowance has been provided, we reverse the related valuation allowance. If our actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction differs from estimates, additional allowances or reversals of a valuation allowance may be necessary. In addition, we only recognize benefits for tax positions that we believe are more likely than not of being sustained upon review by a taxing authority with knowledge of all relevant information. We reevaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and any changes to these positions as a result of tax audits, tax laws or other facts and circumstances could result in additional charges or credits to operations. The expiration of statutes of limitations affecting estimates made for uncertain tax positions can cause higher earnings.\nInventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with costs determined by the first-in, first-out method for a majority of subsidiaries and by average cost for certain other subsidiaries. We record provisions to account for excess and obsolete inventory to reflect the expected non-saleable or non-refundable inventory based on an evaluation of slow moving products or products no longer offered for sale. Inventories also include demonstration units located in our demonstration laboratories or installed at the sites of potential customers. We consider our demonstration units to be available for sale. We reduce the carrying value of demonstration inventories for differences between cost and estimated net realizable value, taking into consideration usage in the preceding twelve months, expected demand, technological obsolescence and other information including the physical condition of the unit. If ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand, additional write-downs may be required, resulting in additional charges to operations.\nGoodwill, other intangible assets and other long-lived assets. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is the operating segment or one level below an operating segment. Under U.S. GAAP, we have the option of performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary before performing a two-step quantitative assessment. The qualitative assessment requires significant judgments about macro-economic conditions including the entity's operating environment; its industry and other market considerations; entity-specific events related to financial performance or loss of key personnel; and other events that could impact the reporting unit. If, as a result of our qualitative assessment, it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. If a quantitative impairment test is performed, the first step involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. We generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of\nboth the market approach and the income approach methodologies. The income approach valuation methodology includes discounted cash flow estimates. Estimating the fair value of the reporting units requires significant judgment about the future cash flows. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment. In the second step of the goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. At December 31, 2015, we performed our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment evaluation using a quantitative impairment test and concluded the fair values of each of our reporting units were significantly greater than their carrying amounts, and therefore, no additional impairment was required.\nWe also review definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets when indications of potential impairment exist. Should the fair value of our long-lived assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines or other indicators of an impairment, a charge to operations for impairment may be necessary.\nEmployee benefit plan assumptions. Substantially all of our employees in Switzerland, France and Japan, as well as certain employees in Germany, are covered by defined benefit pension plans. Retirement benefits are generally earned based on years of service and compensation during active employment. Retirement plan costs are a significant cost of doing business. They represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and, therefore, are subject to estimation. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees' average expected future service based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions. To estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations, we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of U.S. GAAP. Two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. Other important assumptions include, expected future salary increases, expected future increases to benefit payments, expected retirement dates, employee turnover, retiree mortality rates and portfolio composition. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually.\nThe discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date which is December 31. For 2015 and 2014, the discount rates were determined on the basis of the yield on corporate bonds with a rating of AA or AAA and the projected benefit obligation cash flows. Lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense. If we changed our discount rates by 1 percent, the impact would be approximately $4.5 million on annual pension expense.\nThe expected long-term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on various asset categories of plan assets. Plan assets are valued at fair value. We apply the expected rate of return to a market-related value of assets, which stabilizes variability in assets to which the expected return is applied. If we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent, the impact would be approximately $1.0 million on annual pension expense. For 2015, actual return on assets was below expectations, which increased the next year's pension cost, net of contributions during the year, as well as decreased the funded status at December 31, 2015.\nThe net periodic benefit costs recorded in operations were $21.7 million, $5.4 million, and $8.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The net periodic benefit costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes a one-time, non-cash settlement loss of $10.2 million as we outsourced our pension plan in Switzerland to an outside insurance provider, transferred certain plan assets and pension obligations for retirees and other certain members of the population, made certain plan design changes and re-measured the liability.\nWe use a corridor approach to amortize actuarial gains and losses. Under this approach, net actuarial gains or losses in excess of ten percent of the larger of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortized over the average remaining service of active participants who are expected to receive benefits under the plans.\nAt December 31, 2015 we expect to contribute $5.6 million to our existing defined benefit pension plans in 2016.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nIn November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which eliminates the current requirement to present deferred tax assets and liabilities as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Instead, entities will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We elected to early adopt this standard prospectively and all deferred taxes are shown as noncurrent in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments. ASU 2015-16 eliminates the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. Instead, an acquirer will recognize a measurement-period adjustment during the period in which it determines the amount of the adjustment, including the effect on earnings of any amounts it would have recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2015-16 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. The new guidance eliminates the measurement of inventory at market value, and inventory will now be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The ASU defines net realizable value as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. No other changes were made to the current guidance on inventory measurement. ASU No. 2015-11 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted and should be applied prospectively. We are evaluating the provisions of this statement and have not determined what impact the adoption of ASU No. 2015-11 will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The new guidance changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in the balance sheet to a reduction of the related debt liability instead of classifying as an asset. The income statement presentation of debt issuance costs is unchanged. ASU No. 2015-03 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those years. Early application is permitted and the guidance is applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements, excluding debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements from the scope of ASU No. 2015-03. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 605. The new guidance was the result of a joint project between the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and to develop common\nrevenue standards for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. The core principle of the new guidance is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU No. 2014-09 was originally effective prospectively for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years. Early application was not permitted. In August 2015, the FASB elected to defer the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 by one year to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early application permitted as of the original effective date.

The new guidance eliminates the measurement of inventory at market value, and inventory will now be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The ASU defines net realizable value as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. No other changes were made to the current guidance on inventory measurement. ASU No. 2015-11 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted and should be applied prospectively.

The principal drivers of this decline were: continued weakness in end market demand for semiconductor, data storage and microelectronics products; the pricing advantage our Japanese based competitors have resulting from the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar and Euro against the Japanese Yen; and reduced demand from customers in Russia as a result of the geopolitical uncertainty in the region. These declines were partially offset by revenue generated from the recently acquired line of fluorescence microscopy products.\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

ended December 31, 2014, representing effective tax rates of 18.0% and 41.2%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to a partial release of U.S. valuation allowances previously recorded against deferred tax assets, and by changes in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions. Our valuation allowance at December 31, 2015 decreased $20.2 million as compared to December 31, 2014, including a reduction to the beginning of the year valuation allowance of $20.8 million, to account for a change in judgment with respect to the realizability of our U.S. deferred tax assets. This decrease was primarily attributable to U.S. net operating loss and foreign tax credit usage as a result of the repatriation of $235.3 million of foreign earnings to the United States during 2015 prompted by adverse interest rate conditions in Europe that were unfavorably impacting cash balances. Among the evidence supporting our conclusion with respect to the realizability of these deferred tax assets was the elimination of recent cumulative U.S. losses as well as expected future near term U.S. taxable income. Our tax rate may change over time as the amount and mix of jurisdictional income changes.\nWhen products are sold through an independent distributor or a strategic distribution partner who assumes responsibility for installation, we recognize the system sale when the product has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred to the distributor. Our distributors do not have price protection rights or rights of return; however, our products are typically warranted to be free from defect for a period of one year. Revenue is deferred until cash is received when collectability is not reasonably assured or when the price is not fixed or determinable.\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

2015 Credit Agreement are secured by guarantees from certain material subsidiaries, as defined in the 2015 Credit Agreement. The 2015 Credit Agreement also requires the Company to maintain certain financial ratios related to maximum leverage and minimum interest coverage (as defined in the 2015 Credit Agreement). Specifically, the Company's leverage ratio cannot exceed 3.5 and the Company's interest coverage ratio cannot be less than 2.5. In addition to the financial ratios, the 2015 Credit Agreement contains negative covenants, including among others, restrictions on liens, indebtedness of the Company and its subsidiaries, asset sales, dividends and transactions with affiliates. Failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the terms of the 2015 Credit Agreement, which could permit acceleration of the debt and require the Company to prepay the debt before its scheduled due date.\nThe Company recorded an impairment charge of $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, comprising definite-lived intangible

resulting in a gross profit margin of 42.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2014. Included in gross profit were various charges for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs totaling $42.4 million and $44.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Excluding these charges, our gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 46.2% and 44.7%, respectively. The higher gross profit margin is primarily attributable to the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency translation rates, the increased business volume in certain product lines, the favorable impact of recent operational improvement initiatives, product pricing within the Bruker BioSpin Group, outsourcing of various manufacturing activities, and recent divestiture and restructuring actions, including, among others, those within our former CAM Division.\nThe following table presents our results for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in millions, except per share data):\nBEST Segment Revenues\nGoodwill, other intangible assets and other long-lived assets. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is the operating segment or one level below an operating segment. Under U.S. GAAP, we have the option of performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary before performing a two-step quantitative assessment. The qualitative assessment requires significant judgments about macro-economic conditions including the entity's operating environment; its industry and other market considerations; entity-specific events related to financial performance or loss of key personnel; and other events that could impact the reporting unit. If, as a result of our qualitative assessment, it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. If a quantitative impairment test is performed, the first step involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. We generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of\nRevenue\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Weighted\nAverage\nInterest Rate </th> <th> </th> <th>Total Amount\nCommitted\nby Lenders </th> <th> </th> <th>Outstanding\nBorrowings </th> <th> </th> <th>Outstanding\nLetters\nof Credit </th> <th> </th> <th>Total Amount\nAvailable </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2015 Credit Agreement\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>500.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>25.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>474.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other lines of credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>234.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>136.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revolving loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>734.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>25.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>137.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>571.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to: revenue recognition; the expensing and capitalization of software development costs; stock-based compensation expense; restructuring and other related charges; income taxes, including the recoverability of deferred tax assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; inventory reductions for excess and obsolete inventories; estimated fair values of long-lived assets used to measure the recoverability of long-lived assets; intangible assets and goodwill; expected future cash flows used to measure the recoverability of intangible assets and long-lived assets; warranty costs; derivative financial instruments; and contingent liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience, current market and economic conditions, industry trends, and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nOperating Income\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Operating\nIncome </th> <th> </th> <th>Percentage of\nSegment\nRevenue </th> <th> </th> <th>Operating\nIncome </th> <th> </th> <th>Percentage of\nSegment\nRevenue </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BSI\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>99.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>138.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BEST\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>9.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate, eliminations and other (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.2 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>105.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>148.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date which is December 31. For 2015 and 2014, the discount rates were determined on the basis of the yield on corporate bonds with a rating of AA or AAA and the projected benefit obligation cash flows. Lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense. If we changed our discount rates by 1 percent, the impact would be approximately $4.5 million on annual pension expense.\nThe following table summarizes maturities for our significant financial obligations as of December 31, 2015 (dollars in millions):\nOur research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased to $145.7 million, or 9.0% of revenue, from $174.2 million, or 9.6% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2014.

We recognize revenue from system sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, title and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer, and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Title and risk of loss transfers based upon customer acceptance for a system that has been delivered to the customer and installed at a customer facility or, for certain systems, upon shipping terms. For systems that include customer-specific acceptance criteria, we are required to assess when we can demonstrate the acceptance criteria has been met, which generally is upon customer acceptance and

The decrease in research and development expenses was attributable to our efforts to improve the efficiency of our product development process.\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at December 31, 2015 and 2014 totaled $468.3 million and $497.5 million, respectively, of which $420.9 million and $460.7 million, respectively, related to cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside of the U.S. in our foreign subsidiaries, most significantly in the Netherlands and Switzerland.\nBSI Segment revenue decreased by $175.4 million, or 10.5%, to $1,499.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $1,674.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Included in revenue was a decrease of approximately $160.9 million from the impact of foreign currency translation caused by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus the Euro, Japanese Yen and other currencies and a decrease of approximately $37.1 million attributable to the divestiture of the former CAM Division, partially offset by the acquisition of Jordan Valley, Semiconductors, Ltd. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation and our recent acquisitions and divestitures, revenue increased by $22.6 million, or 1.3%, as further discussed below.\nThe following table presents our results for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in millions, except per share data):\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nSystem revenue in the BSI Segment includes nuclear magnetic resonance systems, magnetic resonance imaging systems, electron paramagnetic imaging systems, mass spectrometry systems, gas chromatography systems, CBRNE detection systems, X-ray systems, spark-optical emission spectroscopy systems, atomic force microscopy systems, stylus and optical metrology systems, molecular spectroscopy systems, fluorescent microscopy and other systems. Aftermarket revenues in the BSI Segment include accessory sales, consumables, training and services.\nIn the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we generated $195.0 million in free cash flow. We calculate free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities of $229.2 million less purchases of property, plant and equipment of $34.2 million. Our free cash flow was primarily driven by the higher operating results and reduction in working capital as we progress with our operational improvement initiatives. The time elapsed between the date customer orders are taken, deposits from the customers are received, and our receipt of full payments for the orders can fluctuate significantly from period to period. This cycle had a significantly positive effect on our free cash flow generation in 2015.\nOur gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $763.3 million, resulting in a gross profit margin of 42.2%, compared to $805.2 million, resulting in a gross profit margin of 43.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2013. Included in gross profit were various charges for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs totaling $44.4 million and $27.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Excluding these charges, our gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 44.7% and 45.3%, respectively. The lower gross profit margin was primarily driven by the negative effects of foreign currency translation rates, including the impact of the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus the Japanese Yen, as our Yen denominated revenues substantially exceeded our Yen denominated expenses. In addition, 2013 gross profit margin benefited from license revenue recognized on the sale of technology in the BEST Segment, which had no cost of revenue. These effects were partially offset by favorable changes in the mix of products sold during 2014, including a 21 Tesla high-field magnet that benefited from higher gross profit margins.\n\u2022 Recent Accounting Pronouncements. This section provides a summary of recent accounting pronouncements and discusses their potential impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nBruker CALID Group revenue decreased by $27.9 million, or 4.8%, to $553.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $581.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in revenue was driven by declines in the former CAM Division, in part due to the divestiture and restructuring actions during the third and fourth quarters of 2014, and delays in obtaining export licenses related to certain CBRNE orders. These declines were partially offset by increased sales of the MALDI Biotyper and MIR and NIR product lines.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\n\nThe net periodic benefit costs recorded in operations were $21.7 million, $5.4 million, and $8.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The net periodic benefit costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes a one-time, non-cash settlement loss of $10.2 million as we outsourced our pension plan in Switzerland to an outside insurance provider, transferred certain plan assets and pension obligations for retirees and other certain members of the population, made certain plan design changes and re-measured the liability.\n(a)Represents corporate costs and eliminations not allocated to the reportable segments.\n(a)Represents product and service revenue between reportable segments.\nBEST Segment Revenues\nOther lines of credit are with various financial institutions located primarily in Germany and Switzerland. The Company's other revolving lines of credit are unsecured and are typically due upon demand with interest payable monthly.\n\u2022 $20.0 million 3.16% Series 2012A senior notes due January 18, 2017;\nSelling, General and Administrative\nImpairment of Assets\nAt December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company performed its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment evaluation by performing a qualitative assessment and concluded that it is\n(a)Represents product and service revenue between reportable segments.\nGross Profit\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nBSI Segment Revenues\nOperating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $145.7 million, resulting in an operating margin of 9.0%, compared to income from operations of $105.4 million, resulting in an operating margin of 5.8% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Operating income included restructuring costs of $29.3 million and $36.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which were related to closing facilities and implementing outsourcing and other restructuring initiatives.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nRevenue from accessories and parts is recognized upon shipment. Service revenue is recognized as the services are performed or ratably over the contractual obligation and includes maintenance contracts, extended warranty, training, application support and on-demand services.\nTRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES\nInterest and other income (expense), net during the year ended December 31, 2015 was ($17.7) million, compared to ($4.1) million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nWe will continue to monitor goodwill and long-lived intangible assets, as well as long-lived tangible assets, for possible future impairment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, gross profit margin in the BSI Segment increased to 45.5% from 43.7% in the comparable period in 2014. The increase in gross profit margin percentage was primarily caused by the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency translation rates and the positive impact of higher business volume in certain product lines, recent operational improvement initiatives, increased product pricing, outsourcing of various manufacturing activities, and recent divestiture and restructuring activities. The BEST Segment gross profit margin increased to 19.5% from 18.8% for the comparable period in 2014. Higher gross margins resulted primarily from the completion of certain large projects during the year and from changes in foreign currency translation rates.\n\nOperating income also included $42.9 million and $32.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, for various charges for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs, legal and other professional service fees related to our internal investigation and review of our operations in China, impairment of long-lived assets and costs associated with a global information technology transformation initiative. Excluding the charges noted above, operating margins were 10.2% and 11.2% for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decline in operating margin was driven by the negative effect caused by changes in foreign currency translation rates.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the covenants of the Note Purchase Agreement. Our leverage ratio (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) was 1.0 and our interest coverage ratio (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) was 14.9.\n\nNo impairment losses were recorded related to definite-lived intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2013.\nSegment Results\nSystem and wire revenue and aftermarket revenue as a percentage of total BEST Segment revenue were as follows during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in millions):\nmore-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting units are greater than their carrying amount, and therefore, no additional impairment is required.\nThe following table presents revenue, change in revenue and revenue growth by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in millions):\nThe following table presents revenue, change in revenue, and revenue growth by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in millions):\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our revenue decreased by $185.1 million, or 10.2%, to $1,623.8 million, compared to $1,808.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Included in\n\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased to $451.0 million, or 24.9% of revenue, from $437.9 million, or 23.8% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to: increased sales and marketing spending, particularly in our former LSC Division for our MALDI Biotyper product; the hiring of new senior management; general and administrative spending related to certain investments including financial reporting system improvements and strategic advisory services; higher allowance for doubtful accounts including amounts associated with certain distributor arrangements in Asia; and expenses relating to recent acquisitions. The increases were partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency translation rates.\n\nInventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with costs determined by the first-in, first-out method for a majority of subsidiaries and by average cost for certain other subsidiaries. We record provisions to account for excess and obsolete inventory to reflect the expected non-saleable or non-refundable inventory based on an evaluation of slow moving products or products no longer offered for sale. Inventories also include demonstration units located in our demonstration laboratories or installed at the sites of potential customers. We consider our demonstration units to be available for sale. We reduce the carrying value of demonstration inventories for differences between cost and estimated net realizable value, taking into consideration usage in the preceding twelve months, expected demand, technological obsolescence and other information including the physical condition of the unit. If ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand, additional write-downs may be required, resulting in additional charges to operations.\nSegment Results\nBEST Segment revenue increased by $5.5 million, or 3.7%, to $152.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $147.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to higher sales of cavity devices, which more than offset the 2013 license revenue recognized on the sale of technology.\ncollections and an increase in income taxes payable caused, in part by, additional withholding taxes on repatriated funds. The time elapsed between the date customer orders are taken, deposits from the customers are received, and our receipt of full payments for the orders can fluctuate significantly from period to period. This cycle had a significantly positive effect on our free cash flow generation in 2015.\nDuring 2015, we repatriated $235.3 million of foreign earnings to the United States prompted by adverse interest rate conditions in Europe that were unfavorably impacting cash balances. No incremental U.S. income tax was incurred as the majority of the repatriation was comprised of previously taxed income and we had sufficient U.S. net operating losses and tax credits to offset any remaining tax liability. We used $129.5 million of the repatriated funds to repay our outstanding balance on the revolving credit line under the Amended Credit Agreement.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $2.9 million compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the minority shareholders' proportionate share of the net income recorded by our majority-owned indirect subsidiaries.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $3.0 million of net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce state taxable income; approximately $42.4 million of German Trade Tax net operating losses that are carried forward indefinitely; and $42.9 million of other foreign net operating losses that are expected to expire at various times beginning in 2018. We also had U.S. federal tax credits of approximately $27.8 million available to offset future tax liabilities that expire at various dates, which include research and development tax credits of $14.0 million expiring at various times through 2034, foreign tax credits of $13.8 million expiring at various times through 2024, and state research and development tax credits of $7.1 million. Utilization of these credits and state net operating losses may be subject to annual limitations due to the ownership percentage change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code Section 382 and similar state provisions. In the event of a deemed change in control under Internal Revenue Code Section 382, an annual limitation on the utilization of net operating losses and credits may result in the expiration of all or a portion of the net operating loss and credit carryforwards.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we incurred expenses of $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, to a financial services firm in which one of the former members of our Board of Directors is a partner.\nIncome taxes. The determination of income tax expense requires us to make certain estimates and judgments concerning the annual effective tax rate, the calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the forecasted profitability of our subsidiaries in certain geographic jurisdictions, as well as the deductions, carryforwards and credits that are available to reduce taxable income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial statement and tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates in effect for the year in which these temporary differences are expected to be settled. We estimate the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and we provide a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that we believe will more likely than not go unused. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used for which a valuation allowance has been provided, we reverse the related valuation allowance. If our actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction differs from estimates, additional allowances or reversals of a valuation allowance may be necessary. In addition, we only recognize benefits for tax positions that we believe are more likely than not of being sustained upon review by a taxing authority with knowledge of all relevant information. We reevaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and any changes to these positions as a result of tax audits, tax laws or other facts and circumstances could result in additional charges or credits to operations. The expiration of statutes of limitations affecting estimates made for uncertain tax positions can cause higher earnings.\n\nThe Note Purchase Agreement contains affirmative covenants, including, without limitation, maintenance of corporate existence, compliance with laws, maintenance of insurance and properties, payment of taxes, addition of subsidiary guarantors and furnishing notices and other information. The Note Purchase Agreement also contains certain restrictive covenants that restrict our ability to, among\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $102.4 million, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $201.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. Cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily caused by purchases, net of maturities, of short-term investments of $40.7 million, capital expenditures of $34.2 million and cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $28.6 million. Cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily caused by purchases, net of maturities, of short-term investments of $192.6 million and capital expenditures of $33.8 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of product lines of $25.3 million.\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A, describes the principal factors affecting the results of our operations, financial condition and changes in financial condition, as well as our critical accounting policies and estimates. Our MD&A is organized as follows:\nSystem and wire revenue and aftermarket revenue as a percentage of total BEST Segment revenue were as follows during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in millions):\nOur net income attributable to Bruker Corporation for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $56.7 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, compared to net income of $80.1 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, for 2013. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily caused by lower gross margin levels and a higher effective tax rate, partially offset by gains on the sale of product lines in 2014.\nBSI Segment revenue decreased by $34.9 million, or 2.0%, to $1,674.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $1,709.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Included in revenue was a decrease of approximately $25.5 million from the impact of foreign currency translation caused by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus the Japanese Yen, Russian Ruble and other currencies, and an increase of approximately $2.9 million attributable to recent acquisitions and divestitures. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation and our recent acquisitions and divestitures, revenue decreased by $12.3 million, or 0.7%.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, the major components within interest and other income (expense), net were net interest expense of $11.8 million and realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency denominated transactions of $5.5 million. The realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency denominated transactions during the year ended December 31, 2015 were primarily caused by the fluctuations of the U.S. dollar, the Euro and the Swiss Franc. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the major components within interest and other income (expense), net were net interest expense of $12.5 million, a settlement charge related to the review of our operations in China of $2.4 million and realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency transactions of $2.0 million. These expenses were partially offset by gains on the sale of product lines of $8.3 million, driven by the divestiture of product lines within the former CAM Division noted above, an insurance claim reimbursement of $2.5 million and an incentive from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts of $1.1 million.\nboth the market approach and the income approach methodologies. The income approach valuation methodology includes discounted cash flow estimates. Estimating the fair value of the reporting units requires significant judgment about the future cash flows. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment. In the second step of the goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. At December 31, 2015, we performed our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment evaluation using a quantitative impairment test and concluded the fair values of each of our reporting units were significantly greater than their carrying amounts, and therefore, no additional impairment was required.\n\u2022 $105.0 million 4.31% Series 2012A senior notes due January 18, 2022; and\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The new guidance changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in the balance sheet to a reduction of the related debt liability instead of classifying as an asset. The income statement presentation of debt issuance costs is unchanged. ASU No. 2015-03 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those years. Early application is permitted and the guidance is applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements, excluding debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements from the scope of ASU No. 2015-03. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet.\nOur gross profit margin increased to 43.6% from 42.2% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily caused by the positive impact of recent operational improvement initiatives, product pricing, outsourcing of various manufacturing activities, the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency translation rates and recent divestiture and restructuring actions. These factors are further discussed below within Results of Operations. Selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development costs during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 decreased by approximately $87.3 million from the prior year, which was caused by the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency translation rates and recent divestiture and restructuring actions.\nResearch and Development\nSystem and wire revenue in the BEST Segment includes low and high temperature superconducting wire and superconducting devices, including magnets, linear accelerators and radio frequency cavities. Aftermarket revenues in the BEST Segment consist primarily of license revenue and consumables sales.\nOn February 22, 2016, we announced the establishment of a dividend policy and the declaration by our Board of Directors of an initial quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.04 per share of our issued and outstanding common stock. The dividend will be paid on March 24, 2016 to stockholders of record as of March 4, 2016. Under the dividend policy, we will target a cash dividend to our stockholders in the amount of $0.16 per share per annum, payable in equal quarterly installments. Subsequent dividend declarations and the establishment of record and payment dates for such future dividend payments, if any, are subject our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the dividend policy is in the best interests of our stockholders. The dividend policy may be suspended or cancelled at the discretion of our Board of Directors at any time.\nOperating income also included $40.2 million and $42.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for various charges for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs, legal and other professional service fees related to our internal investigation and review of our operations in China, impairment of long-lived assets, and costs associated with our global IT transformation initiative. Excluding the charges noted above, operating margins were 13.3% and 10.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in operating margin was caused by the improvements in gross profit margins and reduction of operating expenses as discussed above.\nIn May 2011, we entered into an amendment to, and restatement of, our then existing credit agreement, referred to as the Amended Credit Agreement. The Amended Credit Agreement provided a maximum commitment on our revolving credit line of $250.0 million and a maturity date of May 2016. Borrowings under the revolving credit line of the Amended Credit Agreement accrued interest, at our option, at either (a) the greater of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (iii) adjusted LIBOR plus 1.00% or (b) LIBOR, plus margins ranging from 0.80% to 1.65%. There was also a facility fee ranging from 0.20% to 0.35%. The Amended Credit Agreement was repaid in full in October 2015, as noted above.\n\u2022 Overview. This section provides a general description of our business, a brief discussion of our reportable segments, significant recent developments in our business and other opportunities, and challenges and risks that may impact our business in the future.\nBSI Segment revenue decreased by $34.9 million, or 2.0%, to $1,674.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $1,709.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. BEST Segment revenue increased by $5.5 million, or 3.7%, to $152.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $147.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nGross Profit\n\u2022 the time it takes for customers to construct or prepare their facilities for our products; and\nPlease see the Segment Results section later in this section for additional discussion of our revenue.\nBEST operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $11.5 million, resulting in an operating margin of 8.6%, compared to operating income of $3.4 million, resulting in an operating margin of 2.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in operating margin is primarily the result of the increased gross margins as a result of the completion of certain large orders during the year.\nAt December 31, 2015 we expect to contribute $5.6 million to our existing defined benefit pension plans in 2016.\nOn October 27, 2015, we entered into a new revolving credit agreement, referred to as the 2015 Credit Agreement, and terminated the Amended Credit Agreement. The 2015 Credit Agreement provides a maximum commitment on the Company's revolving credit line of $500 million and a maturity date of October 2020. Borrowings under the revolving credit line of the 2015 Credit Agreement accrue interest, at the Company's option, at either (a) the greater of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (iii) adjusted LIBOR plus 1.00%, plus margins ranging from 0.00% to 0.30% or (b) LIBOR, plus margins ranging from 0.90% to 1.30%. There is also a facility fee ranging from 0.10% to 0.20%.\nExcluding the effect of foreign currency translation and our recent acquisitions and divestitures, Bruker CALID Group revenue increased by $37.8 million, or 7.4%, to $591.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $553.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The Bruker CALID Group experienced higher revenue levels for certain mass spectrometry products (primarily MALDI-TOF and MALDI Biotyper) caused primarily by strong underlying academic, pharma, biotech and contract research markets. CBRNE products sales were higher as a result of certain large orders and newly launched explosive trace detection products sold to European airports. The increase in revenue was partially offset by a decline in sales of MIR products caused by weaker demand in end markets.\nWe also review definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets when indications of potential impairment exist. Should the fair value of our long-lived assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines or other indicators of an impairment, a charge to operations for impairment may be necessary.\nOVERVIEW\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, our revenue decreased by $30.5 million, or 1.7%, to $1,808.9 million, compared to $1,839.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Included in revenue was a decrease of approximately $25.4 million from the impact of foreign currency translation caused by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus the Japanese Yen, Russian Ruble and other currencies, and an increase of approximately $2.9 million attributable to recent acquisitions and divestitures. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation and our recent acquisitions and divestitures, revenue decreased by $8.0 million, or 0.4%.\nrevenue was a decrease of approximately $184.4 million from the impact of foreign currency translation caused by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus the Euro, Japanese Yen and other currencies, and a decrease of approximately $37.1 million attributable to divestitures, which was partially offset by the acquisition of Jordan Valley Semiconductors, Ltd. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation and our recent acquisitions and divestitures, revenue increased by $36.4 million, or 2.1%.\nIn May 2015, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program (the \"Anti-Dilutive Repurchase Program\") under which we were authorized to repurchase our common stock in amounts intended to approximately offset, on an annual basis, the dilutive effect of shares that are, or may be, issued pursuant to option or restricted stock awards under our 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan. A total of 1,245,000 shares were repurchased at an aggregate cost of $24.9 million prior to the suspension of the Anti-Dilutive Repurchase Program in November 2015, as discussed below.\nBSI operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $133.2 million, resulting in an operating margin of 8.9%, compared to income from operations of $99.8 million, resulting in an operating margin of 6.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2014. Income from operations included $68.4 million and $73.7 million in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, of various charges representing amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs, legal and other professional fees related to our internal investigation and review of our operations in China, restructuring and relocation costs, impairment of definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets, and costs associated with our global IT transformation initiative. Excluding these costs, operating income for BSI was $201.6 million and $173.5 million, resulting in operating margins of 13.4% and 10.4%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Increases in operating margins were primarily caused by higher gross margin levels and lower operating expenses as discussed above.\nThe following table presents operating income and operating margins on revenue by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in millions):\nIf VSOE cannot be established, we attempt to establish the selling price based on third-party evidence (\"TPE\"). VSOE cannot be established in instances where a product or service has not been sold separately, stand-alone sales are too infrequent or product pricing is not within a sufficiently narrow range. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately.\nNet Income Attributable to Bruker Corporation\nWe currently anticipate that our existing cash and credit facilities will be sufficient to support our operating and investing needs for at least the next twelve months. Our future cash requirements could be affected by acquisitions that we may make, repurchases of our common stock, or the payment of dividends in the future. Historically, we have financed our growth and liquidity needs through cash flow generation and a combination of debt financings and issuances of common stock. In the future, there are no assurances that additional financing alternatives will be available to us, if required, or if available, will be obtained on terms favorable to us.\nWe can experience quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in our operating results as a result of various factors, some of which are outside of our control, such as:\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nIn 2016, we expect to incur $6-$8 million of expense related to various outsourcing initiatives and other restructuring activities that were implemented in 2015 or will commence in 2016.\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, we performed our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment evaluation and concluded the fair values of each of our reporting units were significantly greater than their carrying amounts, and therefore, no additional impairment is required.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and those that require the most estimation and subjective judgment.\nOther charges, net of $20.4 million recorded in 2015 are almost entirely related to the BSI Segment. The charges consisted primarily of a $10.2 million one-time, non-cash settlement charge as the plan assets and pension obligations for the retirees and other certain members of the population within our pension plan in Switzerland were transferred to an outside insurance provider, $8.1 million of restructuring costs related to closing facilities and implementing outsourcing and other restructuring initiatives and $8.9 million of costs associated with our global information technology (IT) transformation initiative, partially offset by ($7.2) million of contingent consideration reversals as it was determined that certain financial targets related to the applicable products would not meet the required thresholds for payment.\nSystem and wire revenue in the BEST Segment includes low and high temperature superconducting wire and superconducting devices, including magnets, linear accelerators and radio frequency cavities. Aftermarket revenues in the BEST Segment consist primarily of license revenue and consumables sales.\nBruker BioSpin Group revenue decreased $1.6 million, or 0.3%, to $622.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $624.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Bruker BioSpin Group revenue reflected lower sales caused by reduced orders of NMR systems from governmental and academic research customers, partially offset by the recognition of revenue on the sale of a 21 Tesla high-field magnet and higher sales of MRI, MI and EPR products.\nOur net income attributable to Bruker Corporation for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $101.6 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, compared to net income of $56.7 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, for 2014. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily caused by increased operating income and a favorable effective tax rate as discussed above.\nOther charges, net of $21.2 million recorded in 2014 related to the BSI Segment. The charges consisted of $11.1 million of restructuring costs related to closing facilities and implementing outsourcing and other restructuring initiatives, $3.2 million of legal and other professional service fees associated with our internal investigation and review of our operations in China, $2.9 million of acquisition-related costs and $4.0 million of costs associated with our global IT transformation initiative.\nExcluding the effect of foreign currency translation, Bruker BioSpin Group revenue decreased $20.6 million, or 3.3%, to $602.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $622.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The Bruker BioSpin Group decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to a decline in revenue for MRI, Molecular Imaging (MI) and EPR products, which was partially offset by increased sales of NMR products predominantly in the second half of 2015. The increase in sales of NMR products of $54.2 million resulted from increased levels of new order bookings over the comparable period in 2014. In addition, the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 benefited from the recognition of a significant 21 Tesla high-field magnet sale.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, gross profit margin in the BSI Segment decreased to 43.7% from 45.3% in the comparable period in 2013. Lower gross profit margins resulted primarily from restructuring charges recorded during the year ended December 31, 2014 related to closing facilities and implementing outsourcing and other restructuring initiatives, and the negative effect of foreign currency translation rates, including the impact of the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus the Japanese Yen. These declines were partially offset by an increase caused by changes in the mix of products sold, including a 21 Tesla high-field magnet that benefited from higher gross margins. The BEST Segment gross profit margin decreased to 18.8% from 21.5% for the comparable period in 2013. Lower gross margins resulted primarily from license revenue recognized in 2013 on the sale of technology which had no cost of revenue.\nUncertain tax contingencies are positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return that may result in additional payments to tax authorities. The total amount of uncertain tax contingencies is included in the \"1-3 Years\" column of the table below as we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of potential future payments. If a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires, then additional payments will not be necessary.\nSystem revenue and aftermarket revenue as a percentage of total BSI Segment revenue were as follows during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in millions):\nWe determine the fair value of products and services based upon vendor specific objective evidence (\"VSOE\"). We determine VSOE based on normal selling pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold on a stand-alone basis. In determining VSOE, our policy requires a substantial majority of selling prices for a product or service to be within a reasonably narrow range. We also consider the class of customer, method of distribution and the geographies into which products and services are being sold when determining VSOE.\nrevenue standards for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. The core principle of the new guidance is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU No. 2014-09 was originally effective prospectively for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years. Early application was not permitted. In August 2015, the FASB elected to defer the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 by one year to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early application permitted as of the original effective date. We are currently assessing the impact the adoption of this standard may have on our consolidated financial statements.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\n(a)Represents corporate costs and eliminations not allocated to the reportable segments.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, our revenue decreased by $185.1 million, or 10.2%, to $1,623.8 million, compared to $1,808.9 million for the comparable period in 2014. The impact of changes in foreign currency translation rates and divestitures in our former Chemical and Applied Markets (CAM) Division, offset by our recent acquisition of Jordan Valley Semiconductors, Ltd., caused a decline of $221.5 million, or 12.3%. Excluding these items, revenue increased 2.1%, which was driven by growth in the Bruker CALID Group, Bruker Nano Group and BEST Segment. Revenue growth in these operating segments was offset by a decline in the Bruker BioSpin Group, as discussed in further detail below within Results of Operations.\nSystem revenue in the BSI Segment included nuclear magnetic resonance systems, magnetic resonance imaging systems, electron paramagnetic imaging systems, mass spectrometry systems, gas chromatography systems, CBRNE detection systems, X-ray systems, spark-optical emission spectroscopy systems, atomic force microscopy systems, stylus and optical metrology systems, molecular spectroscopy systems and other systems. Aftermarket revenues in the BSI Segment include accessory sales, consumables, training and services.\n(1)Unconditional purchase commitments include agreements to purchase goods, services, or fixed assets that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase commitments exclude agreements that are cancellable at any time without penalty.\nOther Charges, Net\nWe also have contracts for which we apply the percentage-of-completion model and completed contract model of revenue recognition. Application of the percentage-of-completion method requires us to make reasonable estimates of the extent of progress toward completion of the contract and the total costs we will incur under the contract and losses are recorded immediately when we estimate that contracts will ultimately result in a loss. Changes in our estimates could affect the timing of revenue recognition.\nWe use a corridor approach to amortize actuarial gains and losses. Under this approach, net actuarial gains or losses in excess of ten percent of the larger of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortized over the average remaining service of active participants who are expected to receive benefits under the plans.\nThe expected long-term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on various asset categories of plan assets. Plan assets are valued at fair value. We apply the expected rate of return to a market-related value of assets, which stabilizes variability in assets to which the expected return is applied. If we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent, the impact would be approximately $1.0 million on annual pension expense. For 2015, actual return on assets was below expectations, which increased the next year's pension cost, net of contributions during the year, as well as decreased the funded status at December 31, 2015.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we incurred expenses of $2.4 million and $5.3 million, respectively, to a law firm in which one of the former members of our Board of Directors is a partner.\nThe following is a summary of the maximum commitments and net amounts available to the Company as of December 31, 2015 (dollars in millions):\nAs previously disclosed, we commenced a restructuring initiative in 2015 within the Bruker BioSpin Group, which was developed as a result of a revenue decline that occurred during the second half of 2014 and continued during the first half of 2015. This initiative is intended to improve Bruker BioSpin Group's operating results. Restructuring actions are expected to result in a reduction of employee headcount within the Bruker BioSpin Group of approximately 9%. Restructuring expenses related to this initiative recorded during the year ended December 31, 2015 were $14.1 million, consisting of $2.1 million for inventory write-downs and $12.0 million of severance and exit costs. The restructuring also includes the closure and consolidation of certain Bruker BioSpin manufacturing facilities. We performed an evaluation during the year ended December 31, 2015 and determined that certain property, plant and equipment were impaired and recorded an impairment charge of $2.1 million to reduce those assets to fair value. Total restructuring and other one-time charges related to this initiative continuing into 2016 are expected to be between $3 and $5 million, which all relate to employee separation and facility exit costs. We expect to generate approximately $10 million in annualized savings when this restructuring initiative is completed by the end of the first quarter in 2016. Prior restructuring initiatives have been executed as planned and there have been no material changes to initially recorded liabilities other than payments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses in the BSI Segment decreased to $604.8 million, or 36.1% of segment revenue, from $609.1 million, or 35.6% of segment revenue, for the comparable period in 2013. The decrease in dollars reflects lower research and development expense attributable to our efforts to improve the efficiency of our product development process. This decrease was offset by: higher sales and marketing spending, particularly for our MALDI Biotyper product; the hiring of new senior management; general and administrative spending related to certain investments including financial reporting system improvement and strategic advisory services; higher allowance for doubtful accounts including amounts associated with certain distributor arrangements in Asia; and expenses caused by recent acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by the effect of changes in foreign currency translation rates. The increase as a percentage of revenue was caused by lower revenue levels in 2014. Selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses in the BEST Segment remained relatively consistent at $20.4 million, or 13.3% of segment revenue, in 2014 compared to $19.3 million, or 13.1% of segment revenue, in 2013.\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded revenue of $0.7 million and $1.9 million, respectively, and incurred expenses of $0.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, arising from commercial transactions with a life sciences company in which a member of our Board of Directors, who joined the Board of Directors in 2014, is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\nNet Income Attributable to Bruker Corporation\n\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased to $392.2 million, or 24.2% of revenue, from $451.0 million, or 24.9% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency translation rates and divestitures within our former CAM Division.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net\nConsolidated Results\nWe lease certain office space from certain of our principal shareholders, including a director and executive officer and another member of our Board of Directors, and members of their immediate families, which have expiration dates ranging from 2016 to 2020. Total rent expense under these leases was $1.8 million, $2.0 million and $2.6 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we outsourced our pension plan in Switzerland to an outside insurance provider, made certain plan design changes, and remeasured the pension liability. As a result, non-cash pension expenses in 2015 increased by approximately $16.0 million, which included a one-time, non-cash settlement charge of $10.2 million recorded in the first quarter of 2015 as the plan assets and pension obligations for the retirees and other certain members of the population were transferred to an outside insurance provider. The settlement charge was recorded as a component of Other Charges, net in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income (loss).\nAt December 31, 2015, we had outstanding debt totaling $266.7 million, consisting of $240.0 million outstanding under the Note Purchase Agreement described below, $25.0 million outstanding under the revolving loan component of the 2015 Credit Agreement described above and $1.7 million under capital lease obligations and other loans. At December 31, 2014, we had outstanding debt totaling $355.0 million, consisting of $240.0 million outstanding under the Note Purchase Agreement described below, $112.5 million outstanding under the revolving loan component of the Amended Credit Agreement described above and $2.5 million under capital lease obligations and other loans.\nThe following table presents operating income and operating margins on revenue by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in millions):\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments. ASU 2015-16 eliminates the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. Instead, an acquirer will recognize a measurement-period adjustment during the period in which it determines the amount of the adjustment, including the effect on earnings of any amounts it would have recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2015-16 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nBSI operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $99.8 million, resulting in an operating margin of 6.0%, compared to income from operations of $138.9 million, resulting in an operating margin of 8.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2013. Income from operations included $73.7 million and $54.1 million in the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, of various charges representing amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs, legal and other professional fees related to our internal investigation and review of our operations in China, restructuring and relocation costs, impairment of definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets and costs associated with a global IT transformation initiative. Excluding these costs, operating income for BSI was $173.5 million and $193.0 million, resulting in operating margins of 10.4% and 11.3%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. Operating income, excluding these costs, decreased as a result of the negative effect of changes in foreign currency translation rates, including the impact the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus the Japanese Yen as our Yen denominated revenues substantially exceeded our Yen denominated expenses, lower gross margin levels and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in research and development expenses.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 605. The new guidance was the result of a joint project between the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and to develop common\nWhen we cannot determine VSOE or TPE, we use estimated selling price (\"ESP\") in our allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would typically transact a stand-alone sale of the product or service. ESP is determined by considering a number of factors including our pricing policies, internal costs and gross profit objectives, method of distribution, market research and information, recent technological trends, competitive landscape and geographies. We analyze the selling prices used in our allocation of arrangement consideration, at a minimum, on an annual basis. Selling prices will be analyzed more frequently if a significant change in our business occurs or other factors necessitate more frequent analysis, or if we experience significant variances in our selling prices.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in financing activities was $168.0 million, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $6.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. Cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily caused by the repayment of the revolving line of credit from the proceeds of the repatriation of certain non U.S. cash, net of additional proceeds of $87.5 million, and repurchases of common stock of $90.0 million, partially offset by the issuance of common stock in connection with stock option exercises of $10.8 million. Cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily caused by proceeds of $7.9 million from the issuance of common stock in connection with stock option exercises, partially offset by repayment of debt of $0.8 million.\nOperating Income\nRevenue\nOperating Income\nITEM 7 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn January 2012, we entered into a note purchase agreement, referred to as the Note Purchase Agreement, with a group of accredited institutional investors. Under the Note Purchase Agreement we issued and sold $240.0 million of senior notes, which consist of the following:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded revenue of $0.5 million from commercial transactions with a thermal analysis company in which a member of our Board of Directors serves as a consultant.\nSystem revenue and aftermarket revenue as a percentage of total BSI Segment revenue were as follows during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in millions):\nOperating income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $105.4 million, resulting in an operating margin of 5.8%, compared to income from operations of $148.2 million, resulting in an operating margin of 8.1% for the year ended December 31, 2013. Operating income included restructuring costs of $36.1 million and $25.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, related to closing facilities and implementing outsourcing and other restructuring initiatives.\nOther charges, net of $21.2 million recorded in 2014 related to the BSI Segment. The charges consisted of $11.1 million of restructuring costs related to closing facilities and implementing outsourcing and other restructuring initiatives, $3.2 million of legal and other professional service fees associated with our internal investigation and review of our operations in China, $2.9 million of acquisition-related costs and $4.0 million of costs associated with the initial stages of a global IT transformation initiative.\nPlease see the Segment Results section later in this section for additional discussion of our revenue.\n\nlong-lived assets to their fair value due to the projected cash flows of those assets not expected to be sufficient to recover their carrying value.\nWe expect to incur approximately $13.5 million of interest expense in 2016.\nResearch and Development\n\u2022 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. This section discusses the accounting estimates that are considered important to our financial condition and results of operations and require us to exercise subjective or complex judgments in their application. All of our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $229.2 million, resulting primarily from consolidated net income adjusted for non-cash items of $182.9 million, and a decrease in working capital of $46.3 million. The decrease in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily caused by improved efficiency in accounts receivable\nInterest and other income (expense), net during the year ended December 31, 2014 was ($4.1) million, compared to ($23.6) million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nOther charges, net of $28.6 million recorded in 2013 related primarily to the BSI Segment. The charges consist of $18.2 million of restructuring costs, including $15.9 million within the BSI Segment and $2.3 million within the BEST Segment, related to closing facilities and implementing outsourcing and other restructuring initiatives, $6.1 million of legal and other professional service fees associated with our internal investigation and review of our operations in China, $3.6 million of acquisition-related costs and $0.7 million related to two factory relocations within the BEST Segment.\nFor transactions that include multiple elements, arrangement consideration is allocated to each element using the fair value hierarchy as required by ASU No. 2009-13. We limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services, future performance obligations, or subject to customer-specific return or refund privileges.\nWe are organized into four operating segments: the Bruker BioSpin Group, the Bruker CALID Group, the Bruker Nano Group and the Bruker Energy & Supercon Technologies (BEST) Segment.\nImpairment of Assets\nBEST Segment revenue decreased by $19.2 million, or 12.6%, to $133.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $152.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decline in revenue was primarily caused by the impact of changes in foreign currency translation, which was partially offset by increases resulting from the completion of the ROSATOM pilot line and the timing of certain large orders.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFor financial reporting purposes, we aggregate the Bruker BioSpin, Bruker CALID and Bruker Nano operating segments into the Bruker Scientific Instruments (BSI) reportable segment, which represented approximately 92% of the Company's revenues during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. This aggregation reflects these operating segments' similar economic characteristics, production processes, customer services provided, types and classes of customers, methods of distribution and regulatory environments. Our BEST Segment is our other reportable segment and represents the remainder of our revenues.\n\u2022 $15.0 million 3.74% Series 2012A senior notes due January 18, 2019;\nUnder the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, we may issue and sell additional senior notes up to an aggregate principal amount of $600 million, subject to certain conditions. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on January 18 and July 18 of each year. The Senior Notes are unsecured obligations of us and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries. The Senior Notes rank pari passu in right of repayment with our other senior unsecured indebtedness. We may prepay some or all of the Senior Notes at any time in an amount not less than 10% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes to be prepaid, at a price equal to the sum of (a) 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and (b) the applicable make-whole amount, upon not less than 30 and no more than 60 days written notice to the holders of the Senior Notes. In the event of a change in control of the Company, as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement, we may be required to prepay the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses in the BSI Segment decreased to $524.2 million, or 35.0% of segment revenue, from $604.8 million, or 36.1% of segment revenue, for the comparable period in 2014. The decrease reflected the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency and recent divestiture and restructuring actions within the former CAM Division. Selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses in the BEST Segment decreased to $13.7 million, or 10.2% of segment revenue, in 2015 compared to $20.4 million, or 13.3% of segment revenue, in 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to the reduction in operating expenses and the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency.\nWe recorded an impairment charge of $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, comprising definite-lived intangible asset and other long-lived assets of $0.9 million and $5.5 million, respectively, relating to our former CAM Division due to restructuring and divestiture actions, and an impairment charge of $5.1 million within our BEST Segment to reduce the carrying value of certain\n\u2022 the time it takes between the date customer orders and deposits are received, systems are shipped and accepted by our customers and full payment is received;\nEarnings per share increased $0.27 to $0.60 per diluted share in the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014. The increase was attributable to operating profit improvements and a favorable effective tax rate due to the release of valuation allowances on certain U.S. deferred tax assets.\nWe regularly evaluate our assertion that our foreign earnings are indefinitely reinvested. If the cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries are needed to fund operations in the U.S., or we otherwise elect to repatriate the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries in the form of dividends or otherwise, or if the shares of the subsidiaries were sold or transferred, we would likely be subject to additional U.S. income taxes, net of the impact of any available tax credits, which could result in a higher effective tax rate in the future. Based on our current plans and anticipated cash needs to fund our U.S. operations, it is our current intent to indefinitely reinvest all unremitted foreign earnings, that have not been previously taxed by the U.S., in our foreign subsidiaries.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nother things, incur liens, transfer or sell assets, engage in certain mergers and consolidations and enter into transactions with affiliates. The Note Purchase Agreement also includes customary representations and warranties and events of default. In the case of an event of default arising from specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency, all outstanding Senior Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. In the case of payment events of defaults, any holder of Senior Notes affected thereby may declare all Senior Notes held by it due and payable immediately. In the case of any other event of default, a majority of the holders of the Senior Notes may declare all the Senior Notes to be due and payable immediately. Pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, so long as any Senior Notes are outstanding we will not permit (i) our leverage ratio, as determined pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, as of the end of any fiscal quarter to exceed 3.50 to 1.00, (ii) our interest coverage ratio as determined pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement as of the end of any fiscal quarter for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to be less than 2.50 to 1 or (iii) priority debt at any time to exceed 25% of consolidated net worth, as determined pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement.\nThese factors have in the past affected the amount and timing of revenue recognized on sales of our products and receipt of related payments and will continue to do so in the future. Accordingly, our operating results in any particular quarter may not necessarily be an indication of any future quarter's operating performance.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by operating activities was $114.3 million, which resulted primarily from consolidated net income adjusted for non-cash items of $153.6 million, partially offset by an increase in working capital of $39.3 million. The increase in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in customer advances as the timing between receipt of customer acceptances, such as obtaining acceptance during the year on a 21 Tesla high-field magnet in the Bruker BioSpin Group and completion of certain orders in the BEST Segment which had relatively large customer advances, and advance payments on new orders received, varied. In addition, there was an increase in accounts receivable caused by higher shipment levels towards the end of the fourth quarter of 2014. These uses of cash were partially offset by cash generated through an increase in accounts payable driven by improved vendor payment practices.\nIn November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which eliminates the current requirement to present deferred tax assets and liabilities as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Instead, entities will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We elected to early adopt this standard prospectively and all deferred taxes are shown as noncurrent in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nConsolidated Results\nExcluding the effect of foreign currency translation and our recent acquisitions and divestitures, Bruker Nano Group revenue increased by $5.5 million, or 1.1%, to $503.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $498.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The Bruker Nano Group experienced an increase in revenue levels in the X-ray diffraction, single crystal X-ray diffraction, and electron microscope analyzer markets, which was partially offset by a decrease in revenue caused by continued weakness in the semiconductor, data storage and industrial markets. Improvements in commercial processes, such as improved sales forecasting resulting in better production planning, improved understanding of customer site readiness and better scheduling of installation services also contributed to the sales increase.\n\n\u2022 Transactions with Related Parties. This section summarizes transactions with related parties.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nEmployee benefit plan assumptions. Substantially all of our employees in Switzerland, France and Japan, as well as certain employees in Germany, are covered by defined benefit pension plans. Retirement benefits are generally earned based on years of service and compensation during active employment. Retirement plan costs are a significant cost of doing business. They represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and, therefore, are subject to estimation. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees' average expected future service based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions. To estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations, we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of U.S. GAAP. Two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. Other important assumptions include, expected future salary increases, expected future increases to benefit payments, expected retirement dates, employee turnover, retiree mortality rates and portfolio composition. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually.\nOperating Income\nOther Charges, Net\nGross Profit and Operating Expenses\nGross Profit and Operating Expenses\nRevenue\nThe income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $41.7 million compared to an income tax provision of $42.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, representing effective tax rates of 41.2% and 34.3%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily caused by unbenefited losses associated with the actions at our former CAM Division. That impact was offset slightly by changes in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions. Our income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 reflects amounts for non-U.S. entities only as we maintained a full valuation allowance against all U.S. deferred tax assets, including our U.S. net operating losses and tax credits, until evidence existed that it is more likely than not that the loss carryforward and credit amounts will be utilized to offset U.S. taxable income.\nRevenue\nWe expect capital expenditures in 2016 to amount to approximately $50 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, the major components within interest and other income (expense), net were net interest expense of $12.5 million, a settlement charge related to the review of our operations in China of $2.4 million and realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency transactions of $2.0 million. These expenses were partially offset by gains on the sale of product lines of $8.3 million driven by the divestiture of product lines within the former CAM Division noted above, an insurance claim reimbursement of $2.5 million, and an incentive from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts of $1.1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2013, the major components within interest and other income (expense), net were net interest expense of $12.4 million and realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency transactions of $10.4 million.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the covenants of the 2015 Credit Agreement. Our leverage ratio (as defined in the 2015 Credit Agreement) was 1.0 and our interest coverage ratio (as defined in the 2015 Credit Agreement) was 14.9.\nBEST operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $3.4 million, resulting in an operating margin of 2.2%, compared to operating income of $9.5 million, resulting in an operating margin of 6.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decline in operating margin was the result of license revenue recognized in 2013 on the sale of technology which had no cost of revenue that did not recur, and impairment charges of $5.1 million recorded in 2014 to reduce the carrying value of certain long-lived assets to their estimated fair value.\n\u2022 $100.0 million 4.46% Series 2012A senior notes due January 18, 2024.\n\u2022 the time required to obtain governmental licenses.\nIn November 2015, our Board of Directors suspended the Anti-Dilutive Repurchase Program until January 1, 2017 and approved an additional share repurchase program (the \"Repurchase Program\") under which repurchases of common stock in the amount of up to $225 million may occur from time to time, in amounts, at prices, and at such times as we deem appropriate, subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other considerations. A total of 2,837,042 shares were repurchased at an aggregate cost of $65.0 million as of December 31, 2015 under this Repurchase Program. The Repurchase Program will continue in 2016 and we intend to fund any additional repurchases from cash on hand, future cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\n\u2022 the timing of governmental stimulus programs and academic research budgets;\n\u2022 Liquidity and Capital Resources. This section provides an analysis of our liquidity and cash flow and a discussion of our outstanding debt and commitments.", "item_7_text": "BSI Segment revenue decreased by $175.4 million, or 10.5%, to $1,499.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $1,674.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. BEST Segment revenue decreased by $19.2 million, or 12.6%, to $133.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $152.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\n\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. The new guidance eliminates the measurement of inventory at market value, and inventory will now be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The ASU defines net realizable value as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. No other changes were made to the current guidance on inventory measurement. ASU No. 2015-11 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted and should be applied prospectively. We are evaluating the provisions of this statement and have not determined what impact the adoption of ASU No. 2015-11 will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $3.3 million compared to $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the minority shareholders' proportionate share of the net income recorded by our majority-owned indirect subsidiaries.\nBruker Nano Group revenue decreased by $5.4 million, or 1.1%, to $498.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $503.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The principal drivers of this decline were: continued weakness in end market demand for semiconductor, data storage and microelectronics products; the pricing advantage our Japanese based competitors have resulting from the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar and Euro against the Japanese Yen; and reduced demand from customers in Russia as a result of the geopolitical uncertainty in the region. These declines were partially offset by revenue generated from the recently acquired line of fluorescence microscopy products.\nWe recorded an impairment charge of $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, comprised of goodwill, definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets of $0.7 million, $1.8 million and $2.1 million, respectively, related to the restructuring actions within the Bruker BioSpin Group during the year.\nThe income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $23.1 million compared to an income tax provision of $41.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, representing effective tax rates of 18.0% and 41.2%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to a partial release of U.S. valuation allowances previously recorded against deferred tax assets, and by changes in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions. Our valuation allowance at December 31, 2015 decreased $20.2 million as compared to December 31, 2014, including a reduction to the beginning of the year valuation allowance of $20.8 million, to account for a change in judgment with respect to the realizability of our U.S. deferred tax assets. This decrease was primarily attributable to U.S. net operating loss and foreign tax credit usage as a result of the repatriation of $235.3 million of foreign earnings to the United States during 2015 prompted by adverse interest rate conditions in Europe that were unfavorably impacting cash balances. Among the evidence supporting our conclusion with respect to the realizability of these deferred tax assets was the elimination of recent cumulative U.S. losses as well as expected future near term U.S. taxable income. Our tax rate may change over time as the amount and mix of jurisdictional income changes.\nWhen products are sold through an independent distributor or a strategic distribution partner who assumes responsibility for installation, we recognize the system sale when the product has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred to the distributor. Our distributors do not have price protection rights or rights of return; however, our products are typically warranted to be free from defect for a period of one year. Revenue is deferred until cash is received when collectability is not reasonably assured or when the price is not fixed or determinable.\nBorrowings under the 2015 Credit Agreement are secured by guarantees from certain material subsidiaries, as defined in the 2015 Credit Agreement. The 2015 Credit Agreement also requires the Company to maintain certain financial ratios related to maximum leverage and minimum interest coverage (as defined in the 2015 Credit Agreement). Specifically, the Company's leverage ratio cannot exceed 3.5 and the Company's interest coverage ratio cannot be less than 2.5. In addition to the financial ratios, the 2015 Credit Agreement contains negative covenants, including among others, restrictions on liens, indebtedness of the Company and its subsidiaries, asset sales, dividends and transactions with affiliates. Failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the terms of the 2015 Credit Agreement, which could permit acceleration of the debt and require the Company to prepay the debt before its scheduled due date.\nThe Company recorded an impairment charge of $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, comprising definite-lived intangible asset and other long-lived assets of $0.9 million and $5.5 million, respectively, relating to our former CAM Division caused by restructuring and divestiture actions, and an impairment charge of $5.1 million within our BEST Segment to reduce the carrying value of certain long-lived assets to their fair value caused by the projected cash flows of those assets not expected to be sufficient to recover their carrying value.\nBSI Segment Revenues\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we recorded revenue of $0.9 million and $0.1 million, respectively, from commercial transactions with a life science supply company in which a member of our Board of Directors is Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and another member of our Board of Directors was formerly a director.\nOur gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $708.6 million, resulting in a gross profit margin of 43.6%, compared to $763.3 million, resulting in a gross profit margin of 42.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2014. Included in gross profit were various charges for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs totaling $42.4 million and $44.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Excluding these charges, our gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 46.2% and 44.7%, respectively. The higher gross profit margin is primarily attributable to the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency translation rates, the increased business volume in certain product lines, the favorable impact of recent operational improvement initiatives, product pricing within the Bruker BioSpin Group, outsourcing of various manufacturing activities, and recent divestiture and restructuring actions, including, among others, those within our former CAM Division.\nThe following table presents our results for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in millions, except per share data):\nBEST Segment Revenues\nGoodwill, other intangible assets and other long-lived assets. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is the operating segment or one level below an operating segment. Under U.S. GAAP, we have the option of performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary before performing a two-step quantitative assessment. The qualitative assessment requires significant judgments about macro-economic conditions including the entity's operating environment; its industry and other market considerations; entity-specific events related to financial performance or loss of key personnel; and other events that could impact the reporting unit. If, as a result of our qualitative assessment, it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. If a quantitative impairment test is performed, the first step involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. We generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of\nRevenue\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to: revenue recognition; the expensing and capitalization of software development costs; stock-based compensation expense; restructuring and other related charges; income taxes, including the recoverability of deferred tax assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; inventory reductions for excess and obsolete inventories; estimated fair values of long-lived assets used to measure the recoverability of long-lived assets; intangible assets and goodwill; expected future cash flows used to measure the recoverability of intangible assets and long-lived assets; warranty costs; derivative financial instruments; and contingent liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience, current market and economic conditions, industry trends, and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nOperating Income\nThe discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date which is December 31. For 2015 and 2014, the discount rates were determined on the basis of the yield on corporate bonds with a rating of AA or AAA and the projected benefit obligation cash flows. Lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense. If we changed our discount rates by 1 percent, the impact would be approximately $4.5 million on annual pension expense.\nThe following table summarizes maturities for our significant financial obligations as of December 31, 2015 (dollars in millions):\nOur research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased to $145.7 million, or 9.0% of revenue, from $174.2 million, or 9.6% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was attributable to the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency translation rates, recent divestitures and restructuring actions, primarily within our former CAM Division, lower material costs and improved efficiency of our product development processes.\nThe repurchased shares are reflected within Treasury stock in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015.\nRevenue recognition. We recognize revenue from system sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, title and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer, and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Title and risk of loss transfers based upon customer acceptance for a system that has been delivered to the customer and installed at a customer facility or, for certain systems, upon shipping terms. For systems that include customer-specific acceptance criteria, we are required to assess when we can demonstrate the acceptance criteria has been met, which generally is upon customer acceptance and evidence of installation.\nSelling, General and Administrative\n\u2022 Results of Operations. This section provides our analysis of the significant line items on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 and for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nOur research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased to $174.2 million, or 9.6% of revenue, from $190.5 million, or 10.4% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in research and development expenses was attributable to our efforts to improve the efficiency of our product development process.\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at December 31, 2015 and 2014 totaled $468.3 million and $497.5 million, respectively, of which $420.9 million and $460.7 million, respectively, related to cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside of the U.S. in our foreign subsidiaries, most significantly in the Netherlands and Switzerland.\nBSI Segment revenue decreased by $175.4 million, or 10.5%, to $1,499.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $1,674.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Included in revenue was a decrease of approximately $160.9 million from the impact of foreign currency translation caused by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus the Euro, Japanese Yen and other currencies and a decrease of approximately $37.1 million attributable to the divestiture of the former CAM Division, partially offset by the acquisition of Jordan Valley, Semiconductors, Ltd. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation and our recent acquisitions and divestitures, revenue increased by $22.6 million, or 1.3%, as further discussed below.\nThe following table presents our results for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in millions, except per share data):\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nSystem revenue in the BSI Segment includes nuclear magnetic resonance systems, magnetic resonance imaging systems, electron paramagnetic imaging systems, mass spectrometry systems, gas chromatography systems, CBRNE detection systems, X-ray systems, spark-optical emission spectroscopy systems, atomic force microscopy systems, stylus and optical metrology systems, molecular spectroscopy systems, fluorescent microscopy and other systems. Aftermarket revenues in the BSI Segment include accessory sales, consumables, training and services.\nIn the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we generated $195.0 million in free cash flow. We calculate free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities of $229.2 million less purchases of property, plant and equipment of $34.2 million. Our free cash flow was primarily driven by the higher operating results and reduction in working capital as we progress with our operational improvement initiatives. The time elapsed between the date customer orders are taken, deposits from the customers are received, and our receipt of full payments for the orders can fluctuate significantly from period to period. This cycle had a significantly positive effect on our free cash flow generation in 2015.\nOur gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $763.3 million, resulting in a gross profit margin of 42.2%, compared to $805.2 million, resulting in a gross profit margin of 43.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2013. Included in gross profit were various charges for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs totaling $44.4 million and $27.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Excluding these charges, our gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 44.7% and 45.3%, respectively. The lower gross profit margin was primarily driven by the negative effects of foreign currency translation rates, including the impact of the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus the Japanese Yen, as our Yen denominated revenues substantially exceeded our Yen denominated expenses. In addition, 2013 gross profit margin benefited from license revenue recognized on the sale of technology in the BEST Segment, which had no cost of revenue. These effects were partially offset by favorable changes in the mix of products sold during 2014, including a 21 Tesla high-field magnet that benefited from higher gross profit margins.\n\u2022 Recent Accounting Pronouncements. This section provides a summary of recent accounting pronouncements and discusses their potential impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nBruker CALID Group revenue decreased by $27.9 million, or 4.8%, to $553.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $581.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in revenue was driven by declines in the former CAM Division, in part due to the divestiture and restructuring actions during the third and fourth quarters of 2014, and delays in obtaining export licenses related to certain CBRNE orders. These declines were partially offset by increased sales of the MALDI Biotyper and MIR and NIR product lines.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\n\nThe net periodic benefit costs recorded in operations were $21.7 million, $5.4 million, and $8.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The net periodic benefit costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes a one-time, non-cash settlement loss of $10.2 million as we outsourced our pension plan in Switzerland to an outside insurance provider, transferred certain plan assets and pension obligations for retirees and other certain members of the population, made certain plan design changes and re-measured the liability.\n(a)Represents corporate costs and eliminations not allocated to the reportable segments.\n(a)Represents product and service revenue between reportable segments.\nBEST Segment Revenues\nOther lines of credit are with various financial institutions located primarily in Germany and Switzerland. The Company's other revolving lines of credit are unsecured and are typically due upon demand with interest payable monthly.\n\u2022 $20.0 million 3.16% Series 2012A senior notes due January 18, 2017;\nSelling, General and Administrative\nImpairment of Assets\nAt December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company performed its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment evaluation by performing a qualitative assessment and concluded that it is\n(a)Represents product and service revenue between reportable segments.\nGross Profit\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nBSI Segment Revenues\nOperating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $145.7 million, resulting in an operating margin of 9.0%, compared to income from operations of $105.4 million, resulting in an operating margin of 5.8% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Operating income included restructuring costs of $29.3 million and $36.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which were related to closing facilities and implementing outsourcing and other restructuring initiatives.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nRevenue from accessories and parts is recognized upon shipment. Service revenue is recognized as the services are performed or ratably over the contractual obligation and includes maintenance contracts, extended warranty, training, application support and on-demand services.\nTRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES\nInterest and other income (expense), net during the year ended December 31, 2015 was ($17.7) million, compared to ($4.1) million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nWe will continue to monitor goodwill and long-lived intangible assets, as well as long-lived tangible assets, for possible future impairment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, gross profit margin in the BSI Segment increased to 45.5% from 43.7% in the comparable period in 2014. The increase in gross profit margin percentage was primarily caused by the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency translation rates and the positive impact of higher business volume in certain product lines, recent operational improvement initiatives, increased product pricing, outsourcing of various manufacturing activities, and recent divestiture and restructuring activities. The BEST Segment gross profit margin increased to 19.5% from 18.8% for the comparable period in 2014. Higher gross margins resulted primarily from the completion of certain large projects during the year and from changes in foreign currency translation rates.\n\nOperating income also included $42.9 million and $32.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, for various charges for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs, legal and other professional service fees related to our internal investigation and review of our operations in China, impairment of long-lived assets and costs associated with a global information technology transformation initiative. Excluding the charges noted above, operating margins were 10.2% and 11.2% for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decline in operating margin was driven by the negative effect caused by changes in foreign currency translation rates.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the covenants of the Note Purchase Agreement. Our leverage ratio (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) was 1.0 and our interest coverage ratio (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) was 14.9.\n\nNo impairment losses were recorded related to definite-lived intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2013.\nSegment Results\nSystem and wire revenue and aftermarket revenue as a percentage of total BEST Segment revenue were as follows during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in millions):\nmore-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting units are greater than their carrying amount, and therefore, no additional impairment is required.\nThe following table presents revenue, change in revenue and revenue growth by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in millions):\nThe following table presents revenue, change in revenue, and revenue growth by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in millions):\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our revenue decreased by $185.1 million, or 10.2%, to $1,623.8 million, compared to $1,808.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Included in\n\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased to $451.0 million, or 24.9% of revenue, from $437.9 million, or 23.8% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to: increased sales and marketing spending, particularly in our former LSC Division for our MALDI Biotyper product; the hiring of new senior management; general and administrative spending related to certain investments including financial reporting system improvements and strategic advisory services; higher allowance for doubtful accounts including amounts associated with certain distributor arrangements in Asia; and expenses relating to recent acquisitions. The increases were partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency translation rates.\n\nInventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with costs determined by the first-in, first-out method for a majority of subsidiaries and by average cost for certain other subsidiaries. We record provisions to account for excess and obsolete inventory to reflect the expected non-saleable or non-refundable inventory based on an evaluation of slow moving products or products no longer offered for sale. Inventories also include demonstration units located in our demonstration laboratories or installed at the sites of potential customers. We consider our demonstration units to be available for sale. We reduce the carrying value of demonstration inventories for differences between cost and estimated net realizable value, taking into consideration usage in the preceding twelve months, expected demand, technological obsolescence and other information including the physical condition of the unit. If ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand, additional write-downs may be required, resulting in additional charges to operations.\nSegment Results\nBEST Segment revenue increased by $5.5 million, or 3.7%, to $152.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $147.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to higher sales of cavity devices, which more than offset the 2013 license revenue recognized on the sale of technology.\ncollections and an increase in income taxes payable caused, in part by, additional withholding taxes on repatriated funds. The time elapsed between the date customer orders are taken, deposits from the customers are received, and our receipt of full payments for the orders can fluctuate significantly from period to period. This cycle had a significantly positive effect on our free cash flow generation in 2015.\nDuring 2015, we repatriated $235.3 million of foreign earnings to the United States prompted by adverse interest rate conditions in Europe that were unfavorably impacting cash balances. No incremental U.S. income tax was incurred as the majority of the repatriation was comprised of previously taxed income and we had sufficient U.S. net operating losses and tax credits to offset any remaining tax liability. We used $129.5 million of the repatriated funds to repay our outstanding balance on the revolving credit line under the Amended Credit Agreement.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $2.9 million compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the minority shareholders' proportionate share of the net income recorded by our majority-owned indirect subsidiaries.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $3.0 million of net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce state taxable income; approximately $42.4 million of German Trade Tax net operating losses that are carried forward indefinitely; and $42.9 million of other foreign net operating losses that are expected to expire at various times beginning in 2018. We also had U.S. federal tax credits of approximately $27.8 million available to offset future tax liabilities that expire at various dates, which include research and development tax credits of $14.0 million expiring at various times through 2034, foreign tax credits of $13.8 million expiring at various times through 2024, and state research and development tax credits of $7.1 million. Utilization of these credits and state net operating losses may be subject to annual limitations due to the ownership percentage change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code Section 382 and similar state provisions. In the event of a deemed change in control under Internal Revenue Code Section 382, an annual limitation on the utilization of net operating losses and credits may result in the expiration of all or a portion of the net operating loss and credit carryforwards.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we incurred expenses of $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, to a financial services firm in which one of the former members of our Board of Directors is a partner.\nIncome taxes. The determination of income tax expense requires us to make certain estimates and judgments concerning the annual effective tax rate, the calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the forecasted profitability of our subsidiaries in certain geographic jurisdictions, as well as the deductions, carryforwards and credits that are available to reduce taxable income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial statement and tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates in effect for the year in which these temporary differences are expected to be settled. We estimate the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and we provide a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that we believe will more likely than not go unused. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used for which a valuation allowance has been provided, we reverse the related valuation allowance. If our actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction differs from estimates, additional allowances or reversals of a valuation allowance may be necessary. In addition, we only recognize benefits for tax positions that we believe are more likely than not of being sustained upon review by a taxing authority with knowledge of all relevant information. We reevaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and any changes to these positions as a result of tax audits, tax laws or other facts and circumstances could result in additional charges or credits to operations. The expiration of statutes of limitations affecting estimates made for uncertain tax positions can cause higher earnings.\n\nThe Note Purchase Agreement contains affirmative covenants, including, without limitation, maintenance of corporate existence, compliance with laws, maintenance of insurance and properties, payment of taxes, addition of subsidiary guarantors and furnishing notices and other information. The Note Purchase Agreement also contains certain restrictive covenants that restrict our ability to, among\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $102.4 million, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $201.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. Cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily caused by purchases, net of maturities, of short-term investments of $40.7 million, capital expenditures of $34.2 million and cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $28.6 million. Cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily caused by purchases, net of maturities, of short-term investments of $192.6 million and capital expenditures of $33.8 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of product lines of $25.3 million.\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A, describes the principal factors affecting the results of our operations, financial condition and changes in financial condition, as well as our critical accounting policies and estimates. Our MD&A is organized as follows:\nSystem and wire revenue and aftermarket revenue as a percentage of total BEST Segment revenue were as follows during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in millions):\nOur net income attributable to Bruker Corporation for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $56.7 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, compared to net income of $80.1 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, for 2013. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily caused by lower gross margin levels and a higher effective tax rate, partially offset by gains on the sale of product lines in 2014.\nBSI Segment revenue decreased by $34.9 million, or 2.0%, to $1,674.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $1,709.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Included in revenue was a decrease of approximately $25.5 million from the impact of foreign currency translation caused by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus the Japanese Yen, Russian Ruble and other currencies, and an increase of approximately $2.9 million attributable to recent acquisitions and divestitures. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation and our recent acquisitions and divestitures, revenue decreased by $12.3 million, or 0.7%.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, the major components within interest and other income (expense), net were net interest expense of $11.8 million and realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency denominated transactions of $5.5 million. The realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency denominated transactions during the year ended December 31, 2015 were primarily caused by the fluctuations of the U.S. dollar, the Euro and the Swiss Franc. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the major components within interest and other income (expense), net were net interest expense of $12.5 million, a settlement charge related to the review of our operations in China of $2.4 million and realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency transactions of $2.0 million. These expenses were partially offset by gains on the sale of product lines of $8.3 million, driven by the divestiture of product lines within the former CAM Division noted above, an insurance claim reimbursement of $2.5 million and an incentive from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts of $1.1 million.\nboth the market approach and the income approach methodologies. The income approach valuation methodology includes discounted cash flow estimates. Estimating the fair value of the reporting units requires significant judgment about the future cash flows. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment. In the second step of the goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. At December 31, 2015, we performed our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment evaluation using a quantitative impairment test and concluded the fair values of each of our reporting units were significantly greater than their carrying amounts, and therefore, no additional impairment was required.\n\u2022 $105.0 million 4.31% Series 2012A senior notes due January 18, 2022; and\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The new guidance changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in the balance sheet to a reduction of the related debt liability instead of classifying as an asset. The income statement presentation of debt issuance costs is unchanged. ASU No. 2015-03 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those years. Early application is permitted and the guidance is applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements, excluding debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements from the scope of ASU No. 2015-03. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet.\nOur gross profit margin increased to 43.6% from 42.2% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily caused by the positive impact of recent operational improvement initiatives, product pricing, outsourcing of various manufacturing activities, the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency translation rates and recent divestiture and restructuring actions. These factors are further discussed below within Results of Operations. Selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development costs during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 decreased by approximately $87.3 million from the prior year, which was caused by the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency translation rates and recent divestiture and restructuring actions.\nResearch and Development\nSystem and wire revenue in the BEST Segment includes low and high temperature superconducting wire and superconducting devices, including magnets, linear accelerators and radio frequency cavities. Aftermarket revenues in the BEST Segment consist primarily of license revenue and consumables sales.\nOn February 22, 2016, we announced the establishment of a dividend policy and the declaration by our Board of Directors of an initial quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.04 per share of our issued and outstanding common stock. The dividend will be paid on March 24, 2016 to stockholders of record as of March 4, 2016. Under the dividend policy, we will target a cash dividend to our stockholders in the amount of $0.16 per share per annum, payable in equal quarterly installments. Subsequent dividend declarations and the establishment of record and payment dates for such future dividend payments, if any, are subject our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the dividend policy is in the best interests of our stockholders. The dividend policy may be suspended or cancelled at the discretion of our Board of Directors at any time.\nOperating income also included $40.2 million and $42.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for various charges for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs, legal and other professional service fees related to our internal investigation and review of our operations in China, impairment of long-lived assets, and costs associated with our global IT transformation initiative. Excluding the charges noted above, operating margins were 13.3% and 10.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in operating margin was caused by the improvements in gross profit margins and reduction of operating expenses as discussed above.\nIn May 2011, we entered into an amendment to, and restatement of, our then existing credit agreement, referred to as the Amended Credit Agreement. The Amended Credit Agreement provided a maximum commitment on our revolving credit line of $250.0 million and a maturity date of May 2016. Borrowings under the revolving credit line of the Amended Credit Agreement accrued interest, at our option, at either (a) the greater of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (iii) adjusted LIBOR plus 1.00% or (b) LIBOR, plus margins ranging from 0.80% to 1.65%. There was also a facility fee ranging from 0.20% to 0.35%. The Amended Credit Agreement was repaid in full in October 2015, as noted above.\n\u2022 Overview. This section provides a general description of our business, a brief discussion of our reportable segments, significant recent developments in our business and other opportunities, and challenges and risks that may impact our business in the future.\nBSI Segment revenue decreased by $34.9 million, or 2.0%, to $1,674.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $1,709.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. BEST Segment revenue increased by $5.5 million, or 3.7%, to $152.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $147.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nGross Profit\n\u2022 the time it takes for customers to construct or prepare their facilities for our products; and\nPlease see the Segment Results section later in this section for additional discussion of our revenue.\nBEST operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $11.5 million, resulting in an operating margin of 8.6%, compared to operating income of $3.4 million, resulting in an operating margin of 2.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in operating margin is primarily the result of the increased gross margins as a result of the completion of certain large orders during the year.\nAt December 31, 2015 we expect to contribute $5.6 million to our existing defined benefit pension plans in 2016.\nOn October 27, 2015, we entered into a new revolving credit agreement, referred to as the 2015 Credit Agreement, and terminated the Amended Credit Agreement. The 2015 Credit Agreement provides a maximum commitment on the Company's revolving credit line of $500 million and a maturity date of October 2020. Borrowings under the revolving credit line of the 2015 Credit Agreement accrue interest, at the Company's option, at either (a) the greater of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (iii) adjusted LIBOR plus 1.00%, plus margins ranging from 0.00% to 0.30% or (b) LIBOR, plus margins ranging from 0.90% to 1.30%. There is also a facility fee ranging from 0.10% to 0.20%.\nExcluding the effect of foreign currency translation and our recent acquisitions and divestitures, Bruker CALID Group revenue increased by $37.8 million, or 7.4%, to $591.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $553.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The Bruker CALID Group experienced higher revenue levels for certain mass spectrometry products (primarily MALDI-TOF and MALDI Biotyper) caused primarily by strong underlying academic, pharma, biotech and contract research markets. CBRNE products sales were higher as a result of certain large orders and newly launched explosive trace detection products sold to European airports. The increase in revenue was partially offset by a decline in sales of MIR products caused by weaker demand in end markets.\nWe also review definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets when indications of potential impairment exist. Should the fair value of our long-lived assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines or other indicators of an impairment, a charge to operations for impairment may be necessary.\nOVERVIEW\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, our revenue decreased by $30.5 million, or 1.7%, to $1,808.9 million, compared to $1,839.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Included in revenue was a decrease of approximately $25.4 million from the impact of foreign currency translation caused by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus the Japanese Yen, Russian Ruble and other currencies, and an increase of approximately $2.9 million attributable to recent acquisitions and divestitures. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation and our recent acquisitions and divestitures, revenue decreased by $8.0 million, or 0.4%.\nrevenue was a decrease of approximately $184.4 million from the impact of foreign currency translation caused by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus the Euro, Japanese Yen and other currencies, and a decrease of approximately $37.1 million attributable to divestitures, which was partially offset by the acquisition of Jordan Valley Semiconductors, Ltd. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation and our recent acquisitions and divestitures, revenue increased by $36.4 million, or 2.1%.\nIn May 2015, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program (the \"Anti-Dilutive Repurchase Program\") under which we were authorized to repurchase our common stock in amounts intended to approximately offset, on an annual basis, the dilutive effect of shares that are, or may be, issued pursuant to option or restricted stock awards under our 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan. A total of 1,245,000 shares were repurchased at an aggregate cost of $24.9 million prior to the suspension of the Anti-Dilutive Repurchase Program in November 2015, as discussed below.\nBSI operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $133.2 million, resulting in an operating margin of 8.9%, compared to income from operations of $99.8 million, resulting in an operating margin of 6.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2014. Income from operations included $68.4 million and $73.7 million in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, of various charges representing amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs, legal and other professional fees related to our internal investigation and review of our operations in China, restructuring and relocation costs, impairment of definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets, and costs associated with our global IT transformation initiative. Excluding these costs, operating income for BSI was $201.6 million and $173.5 million, resulting in operating margins of 13.4% and 10.4%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Increases in operating margins were primarily caused by higher gross margin levels and lower operating expenses as discussed above.\nThe following table presents operating income and operating margins on revenue by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in millions):\nIf VSOE cannot be established, we attempt to establish the selling price based on third-party evidence (\"TPE\"). VSOE cannot be established in instances where a product or service has not been sold separately, stand-alone sales are too infrequent or product pricing is not within a sufficiently narrow range. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately.\nNet Income Attributable to Bruker Corporation\nWe currently anticipate that our existing cash and credit facilities will be sufficient to support our operating and investing needs for at least the next twelve months. Our future cash requirements could be affected by acquisitions that we may make, repurchases of our common stock, or the payment of dividends in the future. Historically, we have financed our growth and liquidity needs through cash flow generation and a combination of debt financings and issuances of common stock. In the future, there are no assurances that additional financing alternatives will be available to us, if required, or if available, will be obtained on terms favorable to us.\nWe can experience quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in our operating results as a result of various factors, some of which are outside of our control, such as:\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nIn 2016, we expect to incur $6-$8 million of expense related to various outsourcing initiatives and other restructuring activities that were implemented in 2015 or will commence in 2016.\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, we performed our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment evaluation and concluded the fair values of each of our reporting units were significantly greater than their carrying amounts, and therefore, no additional impairment is required.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and those that require the most estimation and subjective judgment.\nOther charges, net of $20.4 million recorded in 2015 are almost entirely related to the BSI Segment. The charges consisted primarily of a $10.2 million one-time, non-cash settlement charge as the plan assets and pension obligations for the retirees and other certain members of the population within our pension plan in Switzerland were transferred to an outside insurance provider, $8.1 million of restructuring costs related to closing facilities and implementing outsourcing and other restructuring initiatives and $8.9 million of costs associated with our global information technology (IT) transformation initiative, partially offset by ($7.2) million of contingent consideration reversals as it was determined that certain financial targets related to the applicable products would not meet the required thresholds for payment.\nSystem and wire revenue in the BEST Segment includes low and high temperature superconducting wire and superconducting devices, including magnets, linear accelerators and radio frequency cavities. Aftermarket revenues in the BEST Segment consist primarily of license revenue and consumables sales.\nBruker BioSpin Group revenue decreased $1.6 million, or 0.3%, to $622.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $624.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Bruker BioSpin Group revenue reflected lower sales caused by reduced orders of NMR systems from governmental and academic research customers, partially offset by the recognition of revenue on the sale of a 21 Tesla high-field magnet and higher sales of MRI, MI and EPR products.\nOur net income attributable to Bruker Corporation for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $101.6 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, compared to net income of $56.7 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, for 2014. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily caused by increased operating income and a favorable effective tax rate as discussed above.\nOther charges, net of $21.2 million recorded in 2014 related to the BSI Segment. The charges consisted of $11.1 million of restructuring costs related to closing facilities and implementing outsourcing and other restructuring initiatives, $3.2 million of legal and other professional service fees associated with our internal investigation and review of our operations in China, $2.9 million of acquisition-related costs and $4.0 million of costs associated with our global IT transformation initiative.\nExcluding the effect of foreign currency translation, Bruker BioSpin Group revenue decreased $20.6 million, or 3.3%, to $602.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $622.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The Bruker BioSpin Group decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to a decline in revenue for MRI, Molecular Imaging (MI) and EPR products, which was partially offset by increased sales of NMR products predominantly in the second half of 2015. The increase in sales of NMR products of $54.2 million resulted from increased levels of new order bookings over the comparable period in 2014. In addition, the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 benefited from the recognition of a significant 21 Tesla high-field magnet sale.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, gross profit margin in the BSI Segment decreased to 43.7% from 45.3% in the comparable period in 2013. Lower gross profit margins resulted primarily from restructuring charges recorded during the year ended December 31, 2014 related to closing facilities and implementing outsourcing and other restructuring initiatives, and the negative effect of foreign currency translation rates, including the impact of the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus the Japanese Yen. These declines were partially offset by an increase caused by changes in the mix of products sold, including a 21 Tesla high-field magnet that benefited from higher gross margins. The BEST Segment gross profit margin decreased to 18.8% from 21.5% for the comparable period in 2013. Lower gross margins resulted primarily from license revenue recognized in 2013 on the sale of technology which had no cost of revenue.\nUncertain tax contingencies are positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return that may result in additional payments to tax authorities. The total amount of uncertain tax contingencies is included in the \"1-3 Years\" column of the table below as we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of potential future payments. If a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires, then additional payments will not be necessary.\nSystem revenue and aftermarket revenue as a percentage of total BSI Segment revenue were as follows during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in millions):\nWe determine the fair value of products and services based upon vendor specific objective evidence (\"VSOE\"). We determine VSOE based on normal selling pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold on a stand-alone basis. In determining VSOE, our policy requires a substantial majority of selling prices for a product or service to be within a reasonably narrow range. We also consider the class of customer, method of distribution and the geographies into which products and services are being sold when determining VSOE.\nrevenue standards for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. The core principle of the new guidance is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU No. 2014-09 was originally effective prospectively for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years. Early application was not permitted. In August 2015, the FASB elected to defer the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 by one year to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early application permitted as of the original effective date. We are currently assessing the impact the adoption of this standard may have on our consolidated financial statements.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\n(a)Represents corporate costs and eliminations not allocated to the reportable segments.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, our revenue decreased by $185.1 million, or 10.2%, to $1,623.8 million, compared to $1,808.9 million for the comparable period in 2014. The impact of changes in foreign currency translation rates and divestitures in our former Chemical and Applied Markets (CAM) Division, offset by our recent acquisition of Jordan Valley Semiconductors, Ltd., caused a decline of $221.5 million, or 12.3%. Excluding these items, revenue increased 2.1%, which was driven by growth in the Bruker CALID Group, Bruker Nano Group and BEST Segment. Revenue growth in these operating segments was offset by a decline in the Bruker BioSpin Group, as discussed in further detail below within Results of Operations.\nSystem revenue in the BSI Segment included nuclear magnetic resonance systems, magnetic resonance imaging systems, electron paramagnetic imaging systems, mass spectrometry systems, gas chromatography systems, CBRNE detection systems, X-ray systems, spark-optical emission spectroscopy systems, atomic force microscopy systems, stylus and optical metrology systems, molecular spectroscopy systems and other systems. Aftermarket revenues in the BSI Segment include accessory sales, consumables, training and services.\n(1)Unconditional purchase commitments include agreements to purchase goods, services, or fixed assets that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase commitments exclude agreements that are cancellable at any time without penalty.\nOther Charges, Net\nWe also have contracts for which we apply the percentage-of-completion model and completed contract model of revenue recognition. Application of the percentage-of-completion method requires us to make reasonable estimates of the extent of progress toward completion of the contract and the total costs we will incur under the contract and losses are recorded immediately when we estimate that contracts will ultimately result in a loss. Changes in our estimates could affect the timing of revenue recognition.\nWe use a corridor approach to amortize actuarial gains and losses. Under this approach, net actuarial gains or losses in excess of ten percent of the larger of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortized over the average remaining service of active participants who are expected to receive benefits under the plans.\nThe expected long-term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on various asset categories of plan assets. Plan assets are valued at fair value. We apply the expected rate of return to a market-related value of assets, which stabilizes variability in assets to which the expected return is applied. If we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent, the impact would be approximately $1.0 million on annual pension expense. For 2015, actual return on assets was below expectations, which increased the next year's pension cost, net of contributions during the year, as well as decreased the funded status at December 31, 2015.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we incurred expenses of $2.4 million and $5.3 million, respectively, to a law firm in which one of the former members of our Board of Directors is a partner.\nThe following is a summary of the maximum commitments and net amounts available to the Company as of December 31, 2015 (dollars in millions):\nAs previously disclosed, we commenced a restructuring initiative in 2015 within the Bruker BioSpin Group, which was developed as a result of a revenue decline that occurred during the second half of 2014 and continued during the first half of 2015. This initiative is intended to improve Bruker BioSpin Group's operating results. Restructuring actions are expected to result in a reduction of employee headcount within the Bruker BioSpin Group of approximately 9%. Restructuring expenses related to this initiative recorded during the year ended December 31, 2015 were $14.1 million, consisting of $2.1 million for inventory write-downs and $12.0 million of severance and exit costs. The restructuring also includes the closure and consolidation of certain Bruker BioSpin manufacturing facilities. We performed an evaluation during the year ended December 31, 2015 and determined that certain property, plant and equipment were impaired and recorded an impairment charge of $2.1 million to reduce those assets to fair value. Total restructuring and other one-time charges related to this initiative continuing into 2016 are expected to be between $3 and $5 million, which all relate to employee separation and facility exit costs. We expect to generate approximately $10 million in annualized savings when this restructuring initiative is completed by the end of the first quarter in 2016. Prior restructuring initiatives have been executed as planned and there have been no material changes to initially recorded liabilities other than payments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses in the BSI Segment decreased to $604.8 million, or 36.1% of segment revenue, from $609.1 million, or 35.6% of segment revenue, for the comparable period in 2013. The decrease in dollars reflects lower research and development expense attributable to our efforts to improve the efficiency of our product development process. This decrease was offset by: higher sales and marketing spending, particularly for our MALDI Biotyper product; the hiring of new senior management; general and administrative spending related to certain investments including financial reporting system improvement and strategic advisory services; higher allowance for doubtful accounts including amounts associated with certain distributor arrangements in Asia; and expenses caused by recent acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by the effect of changes in foreign currency translation rates. The increase as a percentage of revenue was caused by lower revenue levels in 2014. Selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses in the BEST Segment remained relatively consistent at $20.4 million, or 13.3% of segment revenue, in 2014 compared to $19.3 million, or 13.1% of segment revenue, in 2013.\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded revenue of $0.7 million and $1.9 million, respectively, and incurred expenses of $0.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, arising from commercial transactions with a life sciences company in which a member of our Board of Directors, who joined the Board of Directors in 2014, is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\nNet Income Attributable to Bruker Corporation\n\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased to $392.2 million, or 24.2% of revenue, from $451.0 million, or 24.9% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency translation rates and divestitures within our former CAM Division.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net\nConsolidated Results\nWe lease certain office space from certain of our principal shareholders, including a director and executive officer and another member of our Board of Directors, and members of their immediate families, which have expiration dates ranging from 2016 to 2020. Total rent expense under these leases was $1.8 million, $2.0 million and $2.6 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we outsourced our pension plan in Switzerland to an outside insurance provider, made certain plan design changes, and remeasured the pension liability. As a result, non-cash pension expenses in 2015 increased by approximately $16.0 million, which included a one-time, non-cash settlement charge of $10.2 million recorded in the first quarter of 2015 as the plan assets and pension obligations for the retirees and other certain members of the population were transferred to an outside insurance provider. The settlement charge was recorded as a component of Other Charges, net in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income (loss).\nAt December 31, 2015, we had outstanding debt totaling $266.7 million, consisting of $240.0 million outstanding under the Note Purchase Agreement described below, $25.0 million outstanding under the revolving loan component of the 2015 Credit Agreement described above and $1.7 million under capital lease obligations and other loans. At December 31, 2014, we had outstanding debt totaling $355.0 million, consisting of $240.0 million outstanding under the Note Purchase Agreement described below, $112.5 million outstanding under the revolving loan component of the Amended Credit Agreement described above and $2.5 million under capital lease obligations and other loans.\nThe following table presents operating income and operating margins on revenue by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in millions):\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments. ASU 2015-16 eliminates the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. Instead, an acquirer will recognize a measurement-period adjustment during the period in which it determines the amount of the adjustment, including the effect on earnings of any amounts it would have recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2015-16 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nBSI operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $99.8 million, resulting in an operating margin of 6.0%, compared to income from operations of $138.9 million, resulting in an operating margin of 8.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2013. Income from operations included $73.7 million and $54.1 million in the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, of various charges representing amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs, legal and other professional fees related to our internal investigation and review of our operations in China, restructuring and relocation costs, impairment of definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets and costs associated with a global IT transformation initiative. Excluding these costs, operating income for BSI was $173.5 million and $193.0 million, resulting in operating margins of 10.4% and 11.3%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. Operating income, excluding these costs, decreased as a result of the negative effect of changes in foreign currency translation rates, including the impact the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus the Japanese Yen as our Yen denominated revenues substantially exceeded our Yen denominated expenses, lower gross margin levels and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in research and development expenses.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 605. The new guidance was the result of a joint project between the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and to develop common\nWhen we cannot determine VSOE or TPE, we use estimated selling price (\"ESP\") in our allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would typically transact a stand-alone sale of the product or service. ESP is determined by considering a number of factors including our pricing policies, internal costs and gross profit objectives, method of distribution, market research and information, recent technological trends, competitive landscape and geographies. We analyze the selling prices used in our allocation of arrangement consideration, at a minimum, on an annual basis. Selling prices will be analyzed more frequently if a significant change in our business occurs or other factors necessitate more frequent analysis, or if we experience significant variances in our selling prices.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in financing activities was $168.0 million, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $6.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. Cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily caused by the repayment of the revolving line of credit from the proceeds of the repatriation of certain non U.S. cash, net of additional proceeds of $87.5 million, and repurchases of common stock of $90.0 million, partially offset by the issuance of common stock in connection with stock option exercises of $10.8 million. Cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily caused by proceeds of $7.9 million from the issuance of common stock in connection with stock option exercises, partially offset by repayment of debt of $0.8 million.\nOperating Income\nRevenue\nOperating Income\nITEM 7 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn January 2012, we entered into a note purchase agreement, referred to as the Note Purchase Agreement, with a group of accredited institutional investors. Under the Note Purchase Agreement we issued and sold $240.0 million of senior notes, which consist of the following:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded revenue of $0.5 million from commercial transactions with a thermal analysis company in which a member of our Board of Directors serves as a consultant.\nSystem revenue and aftermarket revenue as a percentage of total BSI Segment revenue were as follows during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in millions):\nOperating income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $105.4 million, resulting in an operating margin of 5.8%, compared to income from operations of $148.2 million, resulting in an operating margin of 8.1% for the year ended December 31, 2013. Operating income included restructuring costs of $36.1 million and $25.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, related to closing facilities and implementing outsourcing and other restructuring initiatives.\nOther charges, net of $21.2 million recorded in 2014 related to the BSI Segment. The charges consisted of $11.1 million of restructuring costs related to closing facilities and implementing outsourcing and other restructuring initiatives, $3.2 million of legal and other professional service fees associated with our internal investigation and review of our operations in China, $2.9 million of acquisition-related costs and $4.0 million of costs associated with the initial stages of a global IT transformation initiative.\nPlease see the Segment Results section later in this section for additional discussion of our revenue.\n\nlong-lived assets to their fair value due to the projected cash flows of those assets not expected to be sufficient to recover their carrying value.\nWe expect to incur approximately $13.5 million of interest expense in 2016.\nResearch and Development\n\u2022 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. This section discusses the accounting estimates that are considered important to our financial condition and results of operations and require us to exercise subjective or complex judgments in their application. All of our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $229.2 million, resulting primarily from consolidated net income adjusted for non-cash items of $182.9 million, and a decrease in working capital of $46.3 million. The decrease in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily caused by improved efficiency in accounts receivable\nInterest and other income (expense), net during the year ended December 31, 2014 was ($4.1) million, compared to ($23.6) million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nOther charges, net of $28.6 million recorded in 2013 related primarily to the BSI Segment. The charges consist of $18.2 million of restructuring costs, including $15.9 million within the BSI Segment and $2.3 million within the BEST Segment, related to closing facilities and implementing outsourcing and other restructuring initiatives, $6.1 million of legal and other professional service fees associated with our internal investigation and review of our operations in China, $3.6 million of acquisition-related costs and $0.7 million related to two factory relocations within the BEST Segment.\nFor transactions that include multiple elements, arrangement consideration is allocated to each element using the fair value hierarchy as required by ASU No. 2009-13. We limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services, future performance obligations, or subject to customer-specific return or refund privileges.\nWe are organized into four operating segments: the Bruker BioSpin Group, the Bruker CALID Group, the Bruker Nano Group and the Bruker Energy & Supercon Technologies (BEST) Segment.\nImpairment of Assets\nBEST Segment revenue decreased by $19.2 million, or 12.6%, to $133.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $152.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decline in revenue was primarily caused by the impact of changes in foreign currency translation, which was partially offset by increases resulting from the completion of the ROSATOM pilot line and the timing of certain large orders.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFor financial reporting purposes, we aggregate the Bruker BioSpin, Bruker CALID and Bruker Nano operating segments into the Bruker Scientific Instruments (BSI) reportable segment, which represented approximately 92% of the Company's revenues during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. This aggregation reflects these operating segments' similar economic characteristics, production processes, customer services provided, types and classes of customers, methods of distribution and regulatory environments. Our BEST Segment is our other reportable segment and represents the remainder of our revenues.\n\u2022 $15.0 million 3.74% Series 2012A senior notes due January 18, 2019;\nUnder the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, we may issue and sell additional senior notes up to an aggregate principal amount of $600 million, subject to certain conditions. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on January 18 and July 18 of each year. The Senior Notes are unsecured obligations of us and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries. The Senior Notes rank pari passu in right of repayment with our other senior unsecured indebtedness. We may prepay some or all of the Senior Notes at any time in an amount not less than 10% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes to be prepaid, at a price equal to the sum of (a) 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and (b) the applicable make-whole amount, upon not less than 30 and no more than 60 days written notice to the holders of the Senior Notes. In the event of a change in control of the Company, as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement, we may be required to prepay the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses in the BSI Segment decreased to $524.2 million, or 35.0% of segment revenue, from $604.8 million, or 36.1% of segment revenue, for the comparable period in 2014. The decrease reflected the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency and recent divestiture and restructuring actions within the former CAM Division. Selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses in the BEST Segment decreased to $13.7 million, or 10.2% of segment revenue, in 2015 compared to $20.4 million, or 13.3% of segment revenue, in 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to the reduction in operating expenses and the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency.\nWe recorded an impairment charge of $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, comprising definite-lived intangible asset and other long-lived assets of $0.9 million and $5.5 million, respectively, relating to our former CAM Division due to restructuring and divestiture actions, and an impairment charge of $5.1 million within our BEST Segment to reduce the carrying value of certain\n\u2022 the time it takes between the date customer orders and deposits are received, systems are shipped and accepted by our customers and full payment is received;\nEarnings per share increased $0.27 to $0.60 per diluted share in the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014. The increase was attributable to operating profit improvements and a favorable effective tax rate due to the release of valuation allowances on certain U.S. deferred tax assets.\nWe regularly evaluate our assertion that our foreign earnings are indefinitely reinvested. If the cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries are needed to fund operations in the U.S., or we otherwise elect to repatriate the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries in the form of dividends or otherwise, or if the shares of the subsidiaries were sold or transferred, we would likely be subject to additional U.S. income taxes, net of the impact of any available tax credits, which could result in a higher effective tax rate in the future. Based on our current plans and anticipated cash needs to fund our U.S. operations, it is our current intent to indefinitely reinvest all unremitted foreign earnings, that have not been previously taxed by the U.S., in our foreign subsidiaries.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nother things, incur liens, transfer or sell assets, engage in certain mergers and consolidations and enter into transactions with affiliates. The Note Purchase Agreement also includes customary representations and warranties and events of default. In the case of an event of default arising from specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency, all outstanding Senior Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. In the case of payment events of defaults, any holder of Senior Notes affected thereby may declare all Senior Notes held by it due and payable immediately. In the case of any other event of default, a majority of the holders of the Senior Notes may declare all the Senior Notes to be due and payable immediately. Pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, so long as any Senior Notes are outstanding we will not permit (i) our leverage ratio, as determined pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, as of the end of any fiscal quarter to exceed 3.50 to 1.00, (ii) our interest coverage ratio as determined pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement as of the end of any fiscal quarter for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to be less than 2.50 to 1 or (iii) priority debt at any time to exceed 25% of consolidated net worth, as determined pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement.\nThese factors have in the past affected the amount and timing of revenue recognized on sales of our products and receipt of related payments and will continue to do so in the future. Accordingly, our operating results in any particular quarter may not necessarily be an indication of any future quarter's operating performance.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by operating activities was $114.3 million, which resulted primarily from consolidated net income adjusted for non-cash items of $153.6 million, partially offset by an increase in working capital of $39.3 million. The increase in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in customer advances as the timing between receipt of customer acceptances, such as obtaining acceptance during the year on a 21 Tesla high-field magnet in the Bruker BioSpin Group and completion of certain orders in the BEST Segment which had relatively large customer advances, and advance payments on new orders received, varied. In addition, there was an increase in accounts receivable caused by higher shipment levels towards the end of the fourth quarter of 2014. These uses of cash were partially offset by cash generated through an increase in accounts payable driven by improved vendor payment practices.\nIn November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which eliminates the current requirement to present deferred tax assets and liabilities as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Instead, entities will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We elected to early adopt this standard prospectively and all deferred taxes are shown as noncurrent in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nConsolidated Results\nExcluding the effect of foreign currency translation and our recent acquisitions and divestitures, Bruker Nano Group revenue increased by $5.5 million, or 1.1%, to $503.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $498.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The Bruker Nano Group experienced an increase in revenue levels in the X-ray diffraction, single crystal X-ray diffraction, and electron microscope analyzer markets, which was partially offset by a decrease in revenue caused by continued weakness in the semiconductor, data storage and industrial markets. Improvements in commercial processes, such as improved sales forecasting resulting in better production planning, improved understanding of customer site readiness and better scheduling of installation services also contributed to the sales increase.\n\n\u2022 Transactions with Related Parties. This section summarizes transactions with related parties.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nEmployee benefit plan assumptions. Substantially all of our employees in Switzerland, France and Japan, as well as certain employees in Germany, are covered by defined benefit pension plans. Retirement benefits are generally earned based on years of service and compensation during active employment. Retirement plan costs are a significant cost of doing business. They represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and, therefore, are subject to estimation. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees' average expected future service based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions. To estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations, we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of U.S. GAAP. Two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. Other important assumptions include, expected future salary increases, expected future increases to benefit payments, expected retirement dates, employee turnover, retiree mortality rates and portfolio composition. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually.\nOperating Income\nOther Charges, Net\nGross Profit and Operating Expenses\nGross Profit and Operating Expenses\nRevenue\nThe income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $41.7 million compared to an income tax provision of $42.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, representing effective tax rates of 41.2% and 34.3%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily caused by unbenefited losses associated with the actions at our former CAM Division. That impact was offset slightly by changes in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions. Our income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 reflects amounts for non-U.S. entities only as we maintained a full valuation allowance against all U.S. deferred tax assets, including our U.S. net operating losses and tax credits, until evidence existed that it is more likely than not that the loss carryforward and credit amounts will be utilized to offset U.S. taxable income.\nRevenue\nWe expect capital expenditures in 2016 to amount to approximately $50 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, the major components within interest and other income (expense), net were net interest expense of $12.5 million, a settlement charge related to the review of our operations in China of $2.4 million and realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency transactions of $2.0 million. These expenses were partially offset by gains on the sale of product lines of $8.3 million driven by the divestiture of product lines within the former CAM Division noted above, an insurance claim reimbursement of $2.5 million, and an incentive from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts of $1.1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2013, the major components within interest and other income (expense), net were net interest expense of $12.4 million and realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency transactions of $10.4 million.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the covenants of the 2015 Credit Agreement. Our leverage ratio (as defined in the 2015 Credit Agreement) was 1.0 and our interest coverage ratio (as defined in the 2015 Credit Agreement) was 14.9.\nBEST operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $3.4 million, resulting in an operating margin of 2.2%, compared to operating income of $9.5 million, resulting in an operating margin of 6.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decline in operating margin was the result of license revenue recognized in 2013 on the sale of technology which had no cost of revenue that did not recur, and impairment charges of $5.1 million recorded in 2014 to reduce the carrying value of certain long-lived assets to their estimated fair value.\n\u2022 $100.0 million 4.46% Series 2012A senior notes due January 18, 2024.\n\u2022 the time required to obtain governmental licenses.\nIn November 2015, our Board of Directors suspended the Anti-Dilutive Repurchase Program until January 1, 2017 and approved an additional share repurchase program (the \"Repurchase Program\") under which repurchases of common stock in the amount of up to $225 million may occur from time to time, in amounts, at prices, and at such times as we deem appropriate, subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other considerations. A total of 2,837,042 shares were repurchased at an aggregate cost of $65.0 million as of December 31, 2015 under this Repurchase Program. The Repurchase Program will continue in 2016 and we intend to fund any additional repurchases from cash on hand, future cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\n\u2022 the timing of governmental stimulus programs and academic research budgets;\n\u2022 Liquidity and Capital Resources.
