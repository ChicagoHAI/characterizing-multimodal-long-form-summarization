Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many important factors, including those set forth in Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements. As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires, references to we,\u201d us,\u201d our,\u201d the Company\u201d and Precision\u201d refer to Precision BioSciences, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.\nOverview\nWe are a life sciences company dedicated to improving life through the application of our pioneering, proprietary ARCUS genome editing platform. We leverage ARCUS in the development of our product candidates, which are designed to treat human diseases and create healthy and sustainable food and agricultural solutions. We are actively developing product candidates in three innovative areas: allogeneic CAR T cell immunotherapy, in vivo gene correction, and food. We are currently conducting a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of PBCAR0191 in adult patients with relapsed or refractory, or R/R, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or NHL, or R/R B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or B-ALL. PBCAR0191 is our first gene-edited allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, T cell therapy candidate targeting CD19 and is being developed in collaboration with Servier pursuant to the Servier Agreement. We have received orphan drug designation for PBCAR0191 from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA\u201d), for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL. In August 2020, the FDA granted Fast Track Designation for PBCAR0191 for the treatment of B-ALL. The NHL cohort will include patients with mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL\u201d), an aggressive subtype of NHL, for which we have received orphan drug designation from the FDA. Made from donor-derived T cells modified using our ARCUS genome editing technology, PBCAR0191 recognizes the well characterized tumor cell surface protein CD19, an important and validated target in several B-cell cancers, and is designed to avoid graft-versus-host disease, or GvHD, a significant complication associated with donor-derived, cell-based therapies. We believe that this trial, which is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of PBCAR0191 at increasing dose levels, as well as to evaluate anti-tumor activity, is the first U.S.-based clinical trial to evaluate an allogeneic CAR T therapy for R/R NHL. Furthermore, we believe that our proprietary, one-step engineering process for producing allogeneic CAR T cells with a potentially optimized cell phenotype, at large scale in a cost-effective manner, will enable us to overcome the fundamental clinical and manufacturing challenges that have limited the CAR T field to date. We expect to report updated interim data for the PBCAR0191 study in mid-year 2021.\nIn April 2020, we commenced patient dosing in a Phase 1/2a clinical trial with our second allogeneic CAR T cell therapy product candidate, PBCAR20A. PBCAR20A is wholly owned by us and targets the validated tumor cell surface target CD20. It is being investigated in R/R NHL, including those with R/R chronic lymphocytic leukemia, CLL, or R/R small lymphocytic lymphoma, or SLL. A subset of the NHL patients will have the diagnosis of MCL and we have received orphan drug designation for PBCAR20A from the FDA for the treatment of this disease. Based on the safety profile observed to date with PBCAR0191, the FDA allowed us to commence dosing with PBCAR20A directly at 1 x 106 cells/kg. The study has continued to escalate through dose level two (3 x 106 cells/kg), and, in February 2021, we commenced patient dosing at dose level 3 (480 x 106 cell fixed dose) with a max dose of 6 x 106 cells/kg. We expect to report interim data for the PBCAR20A study in 2021.\nIn June 2020, we commenced patient dosing in a Phase 1/2a clinical trial with our third allogenic CAR T cell therapy product candidate, PBCAR269A. The starting dose of PBCAR269A is 6 x 105 cells/kg. PBCAR269A is wholly owned by us and is designed to target the validated tumor cell surface target BCMA. It is being investigated in subjects with R/R multiple myeloma and we have received orphan drug designation and Fast Track Designation from the FDA for this indication. In September 2020, we announced that we entered into a clinical trial collaboration with SpringWorks, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing medicines for patients with severe rare diseases and cancer. Pursuant to the collaboration, PBCAR269A will be evaluated in combination with nirogacestat, SpringWorks' investigational GSI, in patients with R/R multiple myeloma, which is expected to commence in the first half of 2021. In February 2021, we commenced patient dosing at the highest dose cohort, dose level 3 of 6 x 106 cells/kg and we expect to report interim data on the PBCAR269A trial in 2021.\nAdditionally, in June 2020, Elo, our wholly-owned subsidiary, established a strategic partnership with the Dole and entered into a Research, Development, and Commercialization Agreement with Dole, with the aim to co-develop banana varieties resistant to Foc TR4, utilizing proprietary computational biology workflows and the ARCUS genome editing platform. The disease caused by Foc TR4, commonly known as Fusarium wilt, threatens the continued cultivation of the world's most popular variety of banana called Cavendish, which is of considerable economic significance as this variety is used to produce export bananas for key markets around the globe and Dole is one of the largest producers in the industry. Fungicides, or other traditional means of disease control have failed as the pandemic continues to spread across vital banana growing economies.\nIn September 2020, we regained full clinical development and commercialization rights, and all data we generated for the in vivo chronic HBV program developed under our 2018 collaboration agreement with Gilead Sciences. We are exploring partnership or alternative opportunities to enable the continued development of ARCUS-based HBV therapies.\nIn October 2020, we announced the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's PTAB issued judgements in our favor in two patent interference proceedings that challenged nine U.S. patents we owned. The patents, which issued in 2018, relate to allogeneic CAR T cells produced by inserting a gene encoding a CAR into the TRAC locus, as well as methods of using those cells for cancer immunotherapy. In the interference proceedings, a third party argued that it had invented the technology in 2012. The PTAB, however, found that the third-party patent application did not satisfy the written description requirement and rejected these claims while maintaining the claims in all nine of our patents.\nIn November 2020, we announced a research collaboration and exclusive license agreement with Lilly to utilize ARCUS for the research and development of potential in vivo therapies for genetic disorders, with an initial focus on DMD and two other undisclosed gene targets. Under the agreement, Lilly has the right to nominate up to three additional gene targets for genetic disorders over the first four years of the Development and License Agreement, which may be extended to six years upon Lilly's election and payment of an extension fee.\nIn December 2020, we announced interim clinical results from our Phase 1/2a study of PBCAR0191 as a treatment of R/R NHL and R/R B-ALL. As of the November 16, 2020 cutoff, 27 patients including 16 patients with aggressive NHL and 11 patients with aggressive B-ALL were enrolled and evaluated. In this dose escalation and dose expansion study, PBCAR0191 had an acceptable safety profile with no cases of graft versus host disease, no cases of Grade \u2265 3 cytokine release syndrome, and no cases of Grade \u2265 3 neurotoxicity. PBCAR0191 demonstrated longest durability of response to 11 months in B-ALL. PBCAR0191 with eLD resulted in objective response rate of 83% (5/6) in NHL and B-ALL as compared to 33% (3/9) in NHL with sLD.\nAdditionally, in December 2020, researchers at Elo in collaboration with Alan Chambers, Ph.D., and the Tropical Research and Education Center at the University of Florida published a paper in Nature Food, reporting a chromosome-scale, phased Vanilla planifolia genome, which revealed sequence variants for genes that may impact the vanillin pathway, and therefore influence bean quality, including its productivity, flower anatomy, and disease resistance.\nIn January 2021, we announced that the FDA has accepted our IND application for PBCAR19B, our next-generation, stealth cell, CD19 allogenic CAR T candidate for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, and we expect to begin the Phase 1 study by mid-2021. Additionally, in January 2021, we announced that we received a Notice of Allowance from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for a patent application covering PBCAR19B. The allowed composition claims of this patent application encompass genetically-modified human T cells comprising the PBCAR19B construct, which is inserted within the T cell receptor alpha constant locus. Once issued, patents arising from this patent family will have standard expiration dates in April 2040. In preclinical studies, PBCAR19B has shown to delay both T cell and natural killer cell mediated allogeneic rejection in vitro and may improve the persistence of allogeneic CAR T cells.\nWe expect to advance a program targeting the rare genetic disease PH1 as our lead wholly owned in vivo gene correction program. PH1 affects approximately 1-3 people per million in the United States and is caused by loss of function mutations in the AGXT gene, leading to the accumulation of calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys. Patients suffer from painful kidney stones which may ultimately lead to renal failure. Using ARCUS, we are developing a potential therapeutic approach to PH1 that involves knocking out a gene called HAO1 which acts upstream of AGXT. Suppressing HAO1 has been shown in preclinical models by us to prevent the formation of calcium oxalate. We therefore believe that a one-time administration of an ARCUS nuclease targeting HAO1 may be a viable strategy for a durable treatment of PH1 patients. Pre-clinical research has continued to progress, and we expect to provide an update on this program in the first half of 2021.\nIn January 2021, we disclosed our intention to spinout our wholly owned subsidiary, Elo. We are continuing to explore our strategic options, and the timing of any such sale, spinout or other treatment of Elo remains uncertain.\nSince our formation in 2006, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing ARCUS, conducting research and development activities, recruiting skilled personnel, developing manufacturing processes, establishing our intellectual property portfolio and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from upfront payments from collaboration and licensing agreements, our IPO, and private placements of convertible preferred stock and convertible debt.\nOn April 1, 2019, we completed our IPO of 9,085,000 shares of common stock, including the underwriters' full exercise of their option to purchase an additional 1,185,000 additional shares of common stock, at an offering price of $16.00 per share, for net proceeds of approximately $130.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us. As of December 31, 2020, we have generated approximately $492.5 million from third parties to date.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses and have not generated any revenue from the sale of products. Our ability to generate any product revenue or product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates or the product candidates of our collaborators for which we may receive milestone payments or royalties. Our net losses were $109.0 million and $92.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $286.1 million.\nWe expect our operating expenses to increase substantially in connection with the expansion of our product development programs and capabilities. We will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for one of our product candidates or the product candidates of our collaborators for which we may receive milestone payments or royalties. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our commercialization capability to support product sales, marketing and distribution. In addition, we expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.\nAs a result of these anticipated expenditures, we will need additional financing to support our continuing operations. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public equity, debt financings or other sources, which may include current and new collaborations with third parties. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our inability to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. We cannot assure you that we will ever generate significant revenue to achieve profitability.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of therapeutic and agricultural products, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate revenue from product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be required to raise additional capital on terms that are unfavorable to us or we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.\nWe currently conduct our operations through two reportable segments: Therapeutics and Food. Our Therapeutics segment is focused on allogeneic CAR T immunotherapy and in vivo gene correction. Our Food segment focuses on applying ARCUS to develop food and nutrition products through collaboration agreements with consumer-facing companies.\nImpact of COVID-19 Pandemic\nWe are closely monitoring how the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect our employees, business, preclinical studies and clinical trials. The Company has taken steps in line with guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC\u201d) and the State of North Carolina to protect the health and safety of its employees and the community. We have implemented measures to mitigate exposure risks and support operations. We initiated a health and safety program addressing mandatory use of face masks, social distancing, sanitary handwashing practices, use of personal protective equipment stations, stringent cleaning and sanitization of all facilities and measures to reduce total occupancy in facilities. We have also implemented temperature and symptom screening procedures at each location, and we have continuously communicated to all our Precisioneers that if they are not comfortable coming to work, regardless of role, then they do not have to do so. Per guidance from the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, our employees are considered essential workforce and may receive the COVID-19 vaccination as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defined Group 3 and Group 4.\nWe are working closely with our clinical sites, physician partners and the patient community to monitor and manage the impact of the evolving COVID-19 pandemic. We remain committed to our clinical programs and development plans, however, disruptions, competing resource demands and safety concerns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have caused, and are likely to continue to cause delays in our clinical trial site activation and impact our ability to enroll patients. We may also experience other difficulties, disruptions or delays in conducting preclinical studies or initiating, enrolling, conducting or completing our planned and ongoing clinical trials, and we may incur other unforeseen costs as a result. We expect that the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact our business, including our preclinical studies and clinical trials. At this time, there is still significant uncertainty relating to the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic and impact of related responses. The impact of COVID-19 on our preclinical studies and any further impact to our clinical trials will largely depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate geographic spread of the disease, the duration of the pandemic, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on financial markets and the global economy, and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease. The Coronavirus, Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act ( CARES Act\u201d) was signed into law on March 27, 2020, which provides for, among other things, the deferral of the deposit and payment of certain taxes. Pursuant to the CARES Act, the Company elected to defer payment of the employer's share of social security taxes incurred between May 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020. See Risk Factors- The outbreak of the ongoing novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19 has impacted our business, or and\nany other pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease may materially and adversely impact our business, including our preclinical studies and clinical trials.\u201d in Part I, Item 1A. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTherapeutics Segment Collaborations\nEli Lilly and Company\nIn November 2020, we entered into a research collaboration and exclusive license agreement (the Development and License Agreement\u201d) with Lilly to utilize ARCUS for the research and development of potential in vivo therapies for genetic disorders. Lilly has initially nominated DMD and two gene targets for other genetic disorders, and has the right to nominate up to three additional gene targets for genetic disorders over the first four years of the Development and License Agreement (the Nomination Period\u201d). Lilly may extend the Nomination Period for an additional two years from the date on which such initial Nomination Period ends, upon Lilly's election and payment of an extension fee. Under the terms of the Development and License Agreement, Lilly will receive an exclusive license to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize the resulting licensed products to diagnose, prevent and treat any and all diseases by in vivo gene editing directed against the applicable gene target. The Development and License Agreement provides that we will be responsible for conducting certain pre-clinical research and IND-enabling activities with respect to the gene targets nominated by Lilly to be subject to the collaboration, including manufacture of initial clinical trial material for the first licensed product. Lilly will be responsible for, and must use commercially reasonable efforts with respect to, conducting clinical development and commercialization activities for licensed products resulting from the collaboration, and may engage us for additional clinical and/or initial commercial manufacture of licensed products.\nIn January 2021, we and Lilly closed the Development and License Agreement following clearance under the Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the HSR Act\u201d). In connection with the closing, we received an upfront cash payment of $100.0 million as well as $35.0 million from Lilly's purchase of 3,762,190 newly issued shares of our common stock pursuant to a stock purchase agreement as described below (the Stock Purchase Agreement\u201d). We will also be eligible to receive milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $420 million per licensed product as well as nomination fees for additional targets and certain research funding. If licensed products resulting from the collaboration are approved and sold, we will also be entitled to receive tiered royalties ranging from the mid-single digit percentages to the low-teens percentages on world-wide net sales of the licensed products, subject to customary potential reductions. Lilly's obligation to pay royalties to us expires on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis, upon the latest to occur of certain events related to expiration of patents, regulatory exclusivity or a period of ten years following first commercial sale of the licensed product.\nWe have the right to elect to co-fund the clinical development of one licensed product, which may be selected from among the third or any subsequent licensed products to reach IND filing. If we elect to co-fund such licensed product, we would reimburse Lilly for a portion of the clinical development expenses for such product and, in exchange, each royalty tier with respect to net sales of such licensed product would be increased by a low single digit percentage. During the term of the Development and License Agreement, we may not (and may not license or collaborate with any third party to) research, develop, or commercialize any in vivo gene editing product directed against any gene targets that have been nominated and are subject to the Development and License Agreement.\nUnless earlier terminated, the Development and License Agreement will remain in effect on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the expiration of a defined royalty term for each licensed product and country. Lilly has the right to terminate the Development and License Agreement for convenience by providing advance notice to us. Either party may terminate the Development and License Agreement (i) for material breach by the other party and a failure to cure such breach within the time period specified in the agreement or (ii) due to a challenge to its patents brought by the other party.\nServier\nIn February 2016, we entered into the Servier Agreement, pursuant to which we have agreed to develop allogeneic CAR T cell therapies for five unique antigen targets. One target was selected at the agreement's inception. Two additional hematological cancer targets beyond CD19 and two new solid tumor targets were selected in 2020. With the addition of these new targets, we received development milestone payments in 2020 and may be eligible to receive additional development milestone payments in 2021. We may also be eligible to receive option fees, as well as clinical, regulatory and sales milestone payments in addition to royalties on product sales. Upon selection of an antigen target under the agreement, we have agreed to perform early-stage research and development on individual T cell modifications for the selected target, develop the resulting therapeutic product candidates through Phase 1 clinical trials and prepare initial clinical trial material of such product candidates for use in Phase 2 clinical trials.\nIn October 2020, we entered into Amendment No. 6 to the Servier Agreement, effective as of October 2, 2020 ( Amendment No. 6\u201d). Terms of the Servier Agreement were amended, solely as applicable to PBCAR0191. Under Amendment No. 6, we are required to complete the ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trial of PBCAR0191 in adult patients with R/R NHL and R/R B-ALL (the Clinical Trial\u201d) for a specified number of patients in the Phase 1 portion of the Clinical Trial and a number of patients to be determined by us in the\nPhase 2a portion of the Clinical Trial. We will be solely responsible for all costs and expenses we incur to complete the Clinical Trial, including the production and release of all required clinical trial material.\nThe results of the Clinical Trial will be used to determine whether specified development milestones have been achieved with respect to PBCAR0191, in which case, specified corresponding development milestone payments are payable by Servier to us. The results of the Clinical Trial will also be used to determine whether Phase 2 readiness has been achieved for PBCAR0191 and Servier may determine whether, subject to payment of a commercial option exercise fee, to exercise its commercial option and proceed with development and commercialization of PBCAR0191. Following completion of the Clinical Trial, we are not obligated to conduct any further development activities under the Servier Agreement with respect to PBCAR0191 unless we otherwise agree to conduct such further development activities.\nWe received an upfront payment of $105.0 million under the Servier Agreement in 2016. We have the ability to receive total payments, including the upfront payment, option fees and milestone payments, in the aggregate across all five targets, of up to approximately $1.4 billion. This includes up to $1.3 billion in milestone payments, consisting of up to $329.3 million in development milestone payments and up to $925.0 million in commercial milestone payments. We are also entitled to receive tiered royalties ranging from the mid-single digit percentages to the sub-teen percentages on worldwide net sales, subject to potential customary reductions. We also have the right to participate in the development and commercialization of any licensed products resulting from the collaboration through a 50/50 co-development and co-promotion option in the United States, subject to our payment of an option fee, which is exercisable after Servier's commercial option exercise.\nUnder the Servier Agreement, we recognized $18.0 million and $7.3 million in revenue during the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The amount recorded as deferred revenue was $82.9 million and $80.9 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\nSpringWorks Therapeutics\nIn September 2020, we entered into a Clinical Trial Collaboration Agreement with SpringWorks. Pursuant to the agreement, PBCAR269A will be evaluated in combination with nirogacestat, SpringWorks' investigational GSI, in patients with R/R multiple myeloma. Under the terms of the agreement, we will bear all costs with the conduct of the clinical trial including providing PBCAR269A for use in the trial, and SpringWorks is responsible for providing nirogacestat at its sole cost and expense.\nGilead\nOn July 6, 2020, Gilead Sciences ( Gilead\u201d) notified us of its termination of the collaboration and license agreement dated September 10, 2018, subsequently amended by Amendment No. 1 dated March 10, 2020 or (the Gilead Agreement\u201d), to develop genome editing tools using ARCUS to target viral DNA associated with the hepatitis B virus. Pursuant to the termination notice, the Gilead Agreement terminated on September 4, 2020. Upon termination, we regained full rights and all data we generated for the in vivo chronic hepatitis B program developed under the Gilead Agreement.\nWe recognized $3.9 million and $13.3 million in revenue under the Gilead Agreement during the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, and $1.5 million in deferred revenue as of December 31, 2019. We did not receive any milestone payments under the Gilead Agreement during the years ended December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019.\nTrustees of the University of Pennsylvania\nIn January 2018, we entered into a research, collaboration and license agreement with the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania ( Penn\u201d) to collaborate on the preclinical development for gene editing products involving the delivery of an ARCUS nuclease. On April 29, 2020, both parties agreed to coordinate a wind-down of all activities in their entirety under the agreement, effective as of June 30, 2020, however, in August 2020 and subsequently in January 2021, both parties agreed to extend certain portions of the agreement until 2022. We will not be required to make termination payments to Penn.\nFood Segment Collaborations\nDole Food Company\nThrough our wholly owned subsidiary, Elo, in June 2020, we entered into a Research, Development, and Commercialization Agreement with Dole with the aim to co-develop banana varieties resistant to Foc TR4, utilizing proprietary computational biology workflows and the ARCUS genome editing platform. The disease caused by Foc TR4, commonly known as Fusarium wilt, threatens the continued cultivation of the world's most popular variety of banana called Cavendish, which is of considerable economic significance as this variety is used to produce export bananas for key markets around the globe and Dole is one of the largest\nproducers in the industry. Fungicides, or other traditional means of disease control have failed as the pandemic continues to spread across vital banana growing economies. Development of Foc TR4 varieties is critically important to save the banana industry, to protect the livelihoods of millions of banana growers and continue to provide consumers an affordable and nutritious fruit. Under the terms of the collaboration, Dole will fully fund research and development efforts executed by Elo, and Elo is eligible to receive royalties on any commercialized plant product.\nCargill, Inc.\nIn 2014, through Elo, we and Cargill, Inc. entered into a collaboration to produce ARCUS-optimized canola varieties with significantly lower levels of saturated fatty acids compared to the current levels in greenhouse studies. On July 30, 2020, we and Cargill mutually agreed to terminate the collaboration, effective August 31, 2020.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales in the foreseeable future. We record revenue from collaboration agreements, including amounts related to upfront payments, milestone payments, annual fees for licenses of our intellectual property and research and development funding.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our discovery efforts and the development of our product candidates.

We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase substantially for the foreseeable future and will comprise a larger percentage of our total expenses as we continue our Phase 1/2a clinical trials for our CD19, CD20 and BCMA product candidates, commence our Phase 1 clinical trial of CD19B, and continue to discover and develop additional product candidates.\nWe cannot determine with certainty the duration and costs of ongoing and future clinical trials of our CD19, CD19B, CD20, and BCMA product candidates, or any other product candidate we may develop or if, when or to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. We may never succeed in obtaining marketing approval for any product candidate. The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our CD19, CD19B, CD20, and BCMA product candidates, and any other our product candidate we may develop will depend on a variety of factors, including:\nTable 395: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the scope, rate of progress, expense and results of clinical trials of our CD19, CD19B, CD20, and BCMA product candidates, as well as of any future clinical trials of other product candidates and other research and development activities that we may conduct;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 396: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> increased costs of additional clinical sites to address slowed enrollment due to the impact of COVID-19;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 397: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> uncertainties in clinical trial design and patient enrollment rates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 398: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the actual probability of success for our product candidates, including their safety and efficacy, early clinical data, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 399: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> significant and changing government regulation and regulatory guidance;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 400: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the timing and receipt of any marketing approvals; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 401: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the expense of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or if we experience significant delays in our clinical trials due to slower than expected patient enrollment or other reasons, we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including share-based compensation, for personnel in our executive, finance, business development, operations and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters; professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services; insurance costs; travel expenses; and facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs that are not specifically attributable to research activities.\nWe expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we continue research activities and development of product candidates.\nChange in Fair Value of Convertible Notes Payable\nWe elected on issuance to account for the convertible notes payable we issued in March 2019, or the 2019 Notes, at fair value until their settlement. The change in fair value of the 2019 Notes was recognized through the statement of operations. The 2019 Notes settled into 2,921,461 shares of common stock on the closing of our IPO on April 1, 2019.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest from the 2019 Notes at a rate of 6% per annum.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents.\nIncome Taxes\nSince our inception in 2006, we have generated cumulative federal and state net operating loss and research and development ( R&D\u201d) credit carryforwards for which we have not recorded any net tax benefit due to the uncertainty around utilizing these tax attributes within their respective carryforward periods. As of December 31, 2020, we had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $172.7 million, $116.5 million, and $0.6 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future taxable income. A portion of the U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards in the amount of $19.7 million will begin to expire in 2030 while the remaining federal net operating loss carryforwards of $153.0 million carry forward indefinitely. The state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2025. The foreign net operating losses carryforward indefinitely. As of December 31, 2020, we also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of $9.9 million, which begin to expire in 2027, and an amount less than $0.1 million, which begin to expire in 2030. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had federal Orphan Drug credits of $6.0 million and $1.8 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2038. As of December 31, 2020, we also have federal contribution carryforwards of $0.2 million, which begin to expire in 2021. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at each balance sheet date.\nOn December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into United States law. The TCJA includes a number of changes to existing tax law, including, among other things, a permanent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from a top marginal tax rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, effective as of January 1, 2018, as well as a limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of annual taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, in each case, for losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 (though any such net operating losses may be carried forward indefinitely). The federal tax rate change resulted in a reduction in the gross amount of our deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2017, and a corresponding reduction in our valuation allowance. As a result, no income tax expense or benefit was recognized as of the enactment date of the TCJA.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, together with the changes in those items in dollars:\nTable 402: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 98,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 82,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 134,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 109,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (109,828\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (87,204\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22,624\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in fair value of convertible note payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,758\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (182\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,445\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,673\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (109,006\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (92,877\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (16,129\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $24.3 million, compared to $22.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

The increase of $15.7 million was primarily due to a $16.2 million increase in platform development and early-stage research expenses, a $3.9 million increase in direct research and development expenses related to our CD19 program, partially offset by decreases of $2.7 and $1.8 in direct research and development expenses related to our CD20 and BCMA programs, respectively.\nThe increase in direct research and development expenses for our CD19 program was primarily due to increases in CMO and research organization costs as we continue to enroll additional patients in the Phase 1/2a clinical trial. The decrease in direct research and development expenses for our CD20 and BCMA programs was primarily due to decreases in external CMO costs as we transferred clinical trial material manufacturing activities for CD20 and BCMA in-house to MCAT.\nPlatform development and early-stage research expenses increased primarily due to a $10.9 million increase in employee-related expense associated with increased headcount to support our technology platform development and manufacturing capabilities, a $6.0 million increase in CMO and research organization expense, primarily related to our planned CD19B clinical trial, a $3.3 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense driven by our higher depreciable asset base during the year ended December 31, 2020, and a $0.3 million increase in facility-related expenses, partially offset by a $4.9 million decrease in outsourced research and development expense in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $36.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $27.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $9.1 million was primarily due to an increase of $4.0 million in employee-related expense as we increased our general and administrative headcount, $2.9 million in consulting fees, and $2.5 million in increased administrative expenses, including insurance, information technology, franchise and property taxes, and costs related to operating as a public company, partially offset by a $0.3 million decrease in bank fees and other general and administrative expenses.\nChange in Fair Value of Convertible Notes Payable\nWe elected on issuance to account for the 2019 Notes at fair value until their settlement. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized $9.8 million of expense as changes in fair value. The 2019 Notes were settled on the closing of the IPO in April 2019.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 consists of interest from the 2019 Notes at a rate of 6% per annum.\nInterest Income\nInterest income was $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease of $3.5 million of interest income generated on our cash and cash equivalent balances was the result of lower interest rates and lower cash balances in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nSegment Results\nThe following tables summarize segment revenues and segment operating loss (see Note 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our segments):\nTable 404: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Therapeutics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Food\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total segment revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment operational cash expenditures:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Therapeutics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 71,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 70,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Food\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total segment operational cash expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 79,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 77,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment operating loss:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Therapeutics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (49,978\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (49,427\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Food\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,165\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,378\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total segment operating loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (55,143\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (54,805\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe evaluate the operating performance of each segment based on segment operating loss. Segment operating loss is derived by deducting operational cash expenditures, net, from GAAP revenue. Operational cash expenditures are cash disbursements made that are specifically identifiable to the reportable segment (including specifically identifiable research and development and property, equipment and software expenditures). The reportable segment operational cash expenditures include cash disbursements for compensation, laboratory supplies, purchases of property, equipment and software and procuring services from CROs, CMOs and research organizations. We do not allocate general operational expenses or non-cash income statement amounts to our reportable segments.\nTherapeutics Segment\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $21.9 million, compared to $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $1.3 million was the result of a $10.7 increase in collaboration revenue recognized from Servier, partially offset by a $9.5 million decrease in revenue recognized from Gilead due to the termination of the Gilead Agreement. Segment operational cash expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $71.8 million, compared to $70.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $1.7 million in operational cash expenditures was primarily due to an increase in employee costs and payments made to service providers for contract manufacturing and clinical trial research, partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures for fixed assets and a reduction in payments to external vendors for early-stage research. Segment operating loss increased $0.6 million from $49.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $50.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the factors discussed above.\nFood Segment\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2.4 million, compared to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $0.8 million was primarily attributable to $0.8 million from an agreement with a new collaboration partner entered into during the year ended December 31, 2020. Segment operational cash expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $7.6 million, compared to $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $0.6 million was primarily due to an increase in employee costs and rent payments, partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures for fixed assets. Segment operating loss decreased $0.2 million from $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the factors discussed above. As discussed above, we are assessing various options with respect to a potential separation of Elo from Precision, which could occur during 2021.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates. We expect that our research and development and general and administrative costs will continue to increase, including in connection with conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates, contracting with CROs and CMOs, the addition of laboratory equipment to MCAT in support of preclinical studies and clinical trials, expanding our intellectual property portfolio and providing general and administrative support for our operations. As a result, we will need additional capital to fund our operations, which we may obtain from additional equity or debt financings, collaborations, licensing arrangements or other sources.\nThere are no assurances that we will be successful in obtaining an adequate level of financing as and when needed to finance our operations on terms acceptable to us or at all, particularly in light of the economic downturn and ongoing uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic. If we are unable to secure adequate additional funding as and when needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more product candidates. In addition, the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our liquidity and future funding requirements remains uncertain as of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as the pandemic continues to evolve globally. See Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d above and Risk Factors- The ongoing novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19 has impacted our business and any other pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease may materially and adversely impact our business, including our preclinical studies and clinical trials\u201d in Part I, Item 1A. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.\nWe do not currently have any approved products and have never generated any revenue from product sales. Through the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from our IPO, private placements of our convertible preferred stock, convertible debt and common stock, and upfront payments from collaboration and licensing arrangements. As of December 31, 2020, we had raised approximately $492.5 million of proceeds from third parties through a combination of financings including our IPO, preferred stock and convertible note financings, payments under the Servier Agreement, and funding from other strategic alliances and grants. We also currently have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-238857) filed with the SEC on June 1, 2020 (the Form S-3\u201d) under which we may offer from time to time in one or more offerings\nany combination of common and preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units of up to $200.0 million in the aggregate. As of December 31, 2020, we have not sold any securities under our shelf registration statement.\nCash Flows\nOur cash and cash equivalents totaled $89.8 million as of December 31, 2020, compared to $180.9 million as of December 31, 2019.\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the periods presented:\nTable 405: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (87,386\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (71,015\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,031\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24,666\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 173,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (91,088\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 77,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Used in Operating Activities\nOur primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, which consist primarily of research and development and general and administrative expenses. Our losses have resulted from expenses incurred in connection with our research and development activities, including our clinical programs, preclinical development activities, and general and administrative costs associated with our operations. The use of cash in operating activities during the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 resulted from our net loss adjusted for non-cash expenses and changes in working capital.\nCash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $87.4 million, compared to $71.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cash used in operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs associated with increased headcount, increased costs related to our clinical programs with our ongoing CD19 Phase 1/2a clinical trial and initiation of Phase 1/2a clinical trials for our CD20 and BCMA product candidates in 2020, an increase in legal fees and an increase in lease payments.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities primarily relates to leasehold additions, equipment and software. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $5.0 million, compared to $24.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to the completion of the build-out of our MCAT facility in Research Triangle Park and other leased facilities in 2019.\nCash Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1.3 million, compared to $173.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The higher cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, was due to proceeds received from our IPO, which closed in April 2019, and proceeds from the 2019 Notes, which were issued in March 2019. Financing activities in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 related to cash proceeds received from stock option exercise and our employee stock purchase plan.\nDebt Obligations\nIn March 2019, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $39.6 million of 2019 Notes in a private placement transaction. Upon settlement, the change in fair value of the 2019 Notes was $9.8 million and the accrued interest on the 2019 Notes was $0.2 million. Pursuant to their terms, the 2019 Notes were settled in 2,921,461 shares of our common stock upon the closing of our IPO at a settlement price of $13.60 per share, which is equal to 85% of the IPO price per share.\nIn May 2019, we entered into the Pacific Western Loan Agreement with PWB as amended by the First Amendment to Loan and Security Amendment, effective September 18, 2019, the Second Amendment to Loan and Security Amendment, effective December 3, 2019 (the Original Agreement\u201d). On June 23, 2020, the Company and PWB entered into the Third Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement (the Amendment No. 3\u201d) to the Original Agreement (as amended, the Pacific Western Loan Agreement\u201d). The terms of Amendment No. 3 (a) decrease the aggregate principal amount of advances on a revolving line of credit (the Revolving Line\u201d) from $50.0 million to $30.0 million and (b) extend the maturity date of the Revolving Line to June 23, 2022, provided that, if the Company receives aggregate cash proceeds of at least $125.0 million from the issuance of the Company's equity securities and/or\nupfront cash proceeds from strategic partnerships on terms and conditions reasonably satisfactory to PWB, the maturity date shall then instead be June 23, 2023. Under the terms of Amendment No. 3, the interest rate increased to a variable annual rate equal to the greater of (a) 2.75% above the Prime Rate (as defined in the Original Agreement), and (b) 6.00%. The Company must also maintain an aggregate balance of unrestricted cash at PWB (not including amounts in certain specified accounts) equal to or greater than $10.0 million.\nThe Pacific Western Loan Agreement matures on June 23, 2023, as a result of the events discussed in Note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there have been no borrowings under our Revolving Line, and we are in compliance with the financial covenants under the Pacific Western Loan Agreement.\nFunding Requirements\nOur operating expenses increased substantially in 2020 and are expected to continue to increase in the future in connection with the continuation of our current clinical trials, planned initiation of additional clinical trials and expected growth in our portfolio.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020, cash payments received from Lilly in January 2021 in connection with the closing of the Development and License Agreement, expected operational receipts and available credit will allow us to continue its operations into 2023. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be imprecise, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical and agricultural products, it is difficult to estimate with certainty the amount of our working capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\nTable 406: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the progress, costs and results of our clinical development for our CD19, CD19B, CD20, and BCMA programs as we progress clinical trials, including CRO costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 407: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the progress, costs and results of our additional research and preclinical development programs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 408: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the outcome, timing and cost of meeting regulatory requirements established by the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 409: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs and timing of internal process development and manufacturing scale-up activities and contract with CMOs associated with our CD19, CD19B, CD20, and BCMA programs and other programs we advance through preclinical and clinical development;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 410: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other agreements and the financial terms of such agreements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 411: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the scope, progress, results and costs of any product candidates that we may derive from ARCUS or any other product candidates we may develop alone or with collaborators;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 412: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the extent to which we in-license or acquire rights to other products, product candidates or technologies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 413: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against any intellectual property-related claims; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 414: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any product candidates for which we or our collaborators obtain marketing approval.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUntil such time, if ever, that we can generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public or private equity or debt financings, collaboration agreements, other third-party funding, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and marketing and/or distribution arrangements.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, shareholders' ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our shareholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through other third-party funding, collaboration agreements, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, product development and research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following is a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2020:\nTable 415: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total(2)(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less Than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lease Obligations(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 416: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Represents future minimum lease payments under our leases for office and/or lab space at the following locations: 302 East Pettigrew Street, Durham, North Carolina expiring in July 2024, 3054 Cornwallis Road, Durham, North Carolina expiring in April 2026 and 20 TW Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina expiring in August 2027. The lease obligations amounts above also represent future minimum lease payments on the MCAT Expansion Space as we are contractually obligated to make such payments on the MCAT Expansion Space notwithstanding that the lease commencement date for accounting purposes was not reached as of December 31, 2020 (see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on these lease agreements).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 417: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> We have entered into a license agreement with an undisclosed licensee for intellectual property used in our research programs.

The Revolving Line bears interest at a variable annual rate equal to the greater of (a) 2.75% above the Prime Rate (as defined in the Original Agreement), and (b) 6.00%. If the Revolving Line is terminated prior to the maturity date, we are required to pay an early termination fee equal to $0.6 million. Upon maturity or termination of the revolving line, then we are required to pay an amount equal to 1% of the maximum principal amount of the advances outstanding at any time.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, we have entered into the Duke License, under which we are obligated to make aggregate future milestone payments of up to $0.2 million upon the achievement of specified corporate milestones as well as low-single digit percent royalty payments based on future net sales of applicable products and specified royalties based on sublicensing revenue. See Business-License and Collaboration Agreements\u201d for more information regarding our payment obligations under the Duke License. We have not included future payments under the Duke License in the table above since the payment obligations under the Duke License are contingent upon future events, such as the achievement of specified milestones or generating product sales, and we are unable to estimate the timing or likelihood of achieving these milestones or generating future product sales. We have also not included our contractual payment obligations under the Duke License in connection with the upfront payment under the Development and License Agreement with Lilly in the table above since, as of December 31, 2020, the completion of the transactions contemplated by the Development and License Agreement had not closed. We closed the transactions under the Development and License Agreement on January 6, 2021 following receipt of clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and as a result we will be required to make payments under the Duke License of $3.0 million in 2021, net of any outstanding credits. See Note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Development and License Agreement.\nWe also enter into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs, CMOs, universities and other third parties for preclinical research studies, clinical trials and testing and manufacturing services. These contracts do not contain minimum purchase commitments and are cancelable by us upon prior written notice. Payments due upon cancellation consist only of payments for services provided or expenses incurred, including non-cancelable obligations of our service providers, up to the date of cancellation. These payments are not included in the table above as the amount and timing of such payments are not known.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, costs and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors\nthat we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenues are generated primarily through collaborative research, license, development and commercialization agreements. The terms of these agreements generally contain multiple elements, or deliverables, which may include (1) licenses, or options to obtain licenses, to use our technology, (2) research and development activities to be performed on behalf of the collaborative partner, and (3) in certain cases, services in connection with the manufacturing of preclinical and clinical material. Payments we receive under these arrangements typically include one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; option exercise fees; funding of research and/or development efforts; clinical and development, regulatory, and sales milestone payments; and royalties on future product sales. We classify payments received under these agreements as revenues within our consolidated statements of operations.\nWe adopted Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606, on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method. Under this method, results for reporting periods beginning on January 1, 2019 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition ( ASC 605\u201d). ASC 606 applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards. Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\nAt contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we evaluate the performance obligations promised in the contract that are based on goods and services that will be transferred to the customer and determine whether those obligations are both (i) capable of being distinct and (ii) distinct in the context of the contract. Goods or services that meet these criteria are considered distinct performance obligations. If both these criteria are not met, the goods and services are combined into a single performance obligation. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied. Arrangements that include rights to additional goods or services that are exercisable at a customer's discretion are generally considered options. We assess if these options provide a material right to the customer and, if so, these options are considered performance obligations. The exercise of a material right is accounted for as a contract modification for accounting purposes.\nWe recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over time, and if over time this is based on the use of an output or input method.\nInvoices issued as stipulated in contracts prior to revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue within current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as noncurrent deferred revenue. Amounts recognized as revenue, but not yet invoiced are generally recognized as contract assets in the Other line item in our consolidated balance sheets.\nMilestone Payments - If an arrangement includes development and regulatory milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee's control, such as regulatory approvals, are generally not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received.\nRoyalties - For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on a level of sales, which are the result of a customer-vendor relationship and for which the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied or partially satisfied. To date, we have not recognized any royalty revenue resulting from any of our licensing arrangements.\nSignificant Financing Component - In determining the transaction price, we adjust consideration for the effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments provides us with a significant benefit of financing. We do not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the expectation at contract inception is such that the period between payment by the licensees and the transfer of the promised goods or services to the licensees will be one year or less. We assessed each of our revenue arrangements in order to determine whether a significant financing component exists and concluded that a significant financing component does not exist in any of our arrangements.\nCollaborative Arrangements - We have entered into collaboration agreements, which are within the scope of ASC 606, to discover, develop, manufacture and commercialize product candidates. The terms of these agreements typically contain multiple promises or obligations, which may include: (1) licenses, or options to obtain licenses, to use our technology, (2) research and development activities to be performed on behalf of the collaboration partner, and (3) in certain cases, services in connection with the manufacturing of preclinical and clinical material. Payments we receive under these arrangements typically include one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; option exercise fees; funding of research and/or development efforts; clinical and development, regulatory, and sales milestone payments; and royalties on future product sales.\nWe analyze our collaboration arrangements to assess whether they are within the scope of ASU No. 2018-18 Collaborative Arrangements, or ASC 808, to determine whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities. This assessment is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in the responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement. For collaboration arrangements within the scope of ASC 808 that contain multiple elements, we first determine which elements of the collaboration are deemed to be within the scope of ASC 808 and those that are more reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and, therefore, are within the scope of ASC 606. For elements of collaboration arrangements that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 808, an appropriate recognition method is determined and applied consistently, generally by analogy to ASC 606. For those elements of the arrangement that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 606, we apply the five-step model described above.\nIn February 2016, we entered into the Servier Agreement for the licensing of our ARCUS proprietary genome editing platform and the research, development, and manufacturing of product for clinical trials and commercialization of products. In September 2018, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Gilead, which we refer to as the Gilead Agreement, to develop genome editing tools using our ARCUS proprietary genome editing platform. Both agreements use our genome editing technology for the treatment of certain diseases. Consideration we received, or may receive, under these collaboration and license agreements include upfront nonrefundable payments, research funding payments and payments based upon the achievement of certain milestones and royalties on any resulting net product sales.\nUnder the guidance of ASC 606, certain judgments affect revenue recognition. Our primary performance obligations under our agreements consist of research and development services. Measuring the amount of time it takes for us to complete these services includes estimating our total effort to satisfy our performance obligations at the outset of the agreement and then comparing that amount to the actual effort expended for a given accounting period. In certain instances, significant judgment is required to estimate the timing of satisfying these obligations and timing may change due to efforts beyond our control, such as changes in the customer's direction of a particular research program or changes to the contractual terms of an agreement. Accordingly, our estimates may change in the future. Such changes to estimates will result in a change in prospective revenue recognition amounts.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated costs incurred for the services when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to the following:\nTable 419: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> CROs and other third parties in connection with performing research and development activities, conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 420: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Vendors in connection with preclinical development activities; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 421: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> CMOs and other vendors in connection with product manufacturing and development and distribution of preclinical supplies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe base our expenses related to preclinical studies on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with CROs that conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials and CMOs that manufacture product for our\nresearch and development activities on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or amount of prepaid expense accordingly.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe measure stock options and other share-based awards granted to our employees, directors, consultants and advisors based on the fair value on the date of the grant and recognize compensation expense for those awards, net of actual forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award.\nWe estimate the fair value of each stock option grant on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and assumptions we make for the expected volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. As we have limited trading history, we estimate our expected volatility based on the historical volatility of publicly traded peer companies and expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our traded share price. The expected term of our options has been determined utilizing a weighted value considering actual exercise history and estimated expected term based on the midpoint of final vest date and expiration date. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nA description of recent accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows is disclosed in Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC rules.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nWe are an emerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies are required to comply with those standards. We have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. As an emerging growth company,\u201d we are also exempted from having to provide an auditor attestation of internal control over financial reporting under Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404(b).\nWe will remain an emerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more, (2) December 31, 2024, (3) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years or (4) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC, which means the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, we have been a public company for at least 12 months and have filed one Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "item_7_truncated": "Additionally, in December 2020, researchers at Elo in collaboration with Alan Chambers, Ph.D., and the Tropical Research and Education Center at the University of Florida published a paper in Nature Food, reporting a chromosome-scale, phased Vanilla planifolia genome, which revealed sequence variants for genes that may impact the vanillin pathway,

The increase in cash used in operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs associated with increased headcount, increased costs related to our clinical programs with our ongoing CD19 Phase 1/2a clinical trial and initiation of Phase 1/2a clinical trials for our CD20 and BCMA product candidates in 2020, an increase in legal

Amounts recognized as revenue, but not yet invoiced are generally recognized as contract assets in the Other line item in our consolidated balance sheets.\nTable 415: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total(2)(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less Than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lease Obligations(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nWe estimate the fair value of each stock option grant on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and assumptions we make for the expected volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. As we have limited trading history, we estimate our expected volatility based on the historical volatility of publicly traded peer companies and expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our traded share price. The expected term of our options has been determined utilizing a weighted value considering actual exercise history and estimated expected term based on the midpoint of final vest date and expiration date. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses and have not generated any revenue from the sale of products. Our ability to generate any product revenue or product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates or the product candidates of our collaborators for which we may receive milestone payments or royalties. Our net losses were $109.0 million and $92.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $286.1 million.\nWe are an emerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies are required to comply with those standards. We have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. As an emerging growth company,\u201d we are also exempted from having to provide an auditor attestation of internal control over financial reporting under Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404(b).\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales in the foreseeable future. We record revenue from collaboration agreements, including amounts related to upfront payments, milestone payments, annual fees for licenses of our intellectual property and research and development funding.\n\nWe received an upfront payment of $105.0 million under the Servier Agreement in 2016. We have the ability to receive total payments, including the upfront payment, option fees and milestone payments, in the aggregate across all five targets, of up to approximately $1.4 billion. This includes up to $1.3 billion in milestone payments, consisting of up to $329.3 million in development milestone payments and up to $925.0 million in commercial milestone payments. We are also entitled to receive tiered royalties ranging from the mid-single digit percentages to the sub-teen percentages on worldwide net sales, subject to potential customary reductions. We also have the right to participate in the development and commercialization of any licensed products resulting from the collaboration through a 50/50 co-development and co-promotion option in the United States, subject to our payment of an option fee, which is exercisable after Servier's commercial option exercise.\nWe also enter into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs, CMOs, universities and other third parties for preclinical research studies, clinical trials and testing and manufacturing services. These contracts do not contain minimum purchase commitments and are cancelable by us upon prior written notice. Payments due upon cancellation consist only of payments for services provided or expenses incurred, including non-cancelable obligations of our service providers, up to the date of cancellation. These payments are not included in the table above as the amount and timing of such payments are not known.\nCollaborative Arrangements - We have entered into collaboration agreements, which are within the scope of ASC 606, to discover, develop, manufacture and commercialize product candidates. The terms of these agreements typically contain multiple promises or obligations, which may include: (1) licenses, or options to obtain licenses, to use our technology, (2) research and development activities to be performed on behalf of the collaboration partner, and (3) in certain cases, services in connection with the manufacturing of preclinical and clinical material. Payments we receive under these arrangements typically include one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; option exercise fees; funding of research and/or development efforts; clinical and development, regulatory, and sales milestone payments; and royalties on future product sales.\nIn March 2019, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $39.6 million of 2019 Notes in a private placement transaction. Upon settlement, the change in fair value of the 2019 Notes was $9.8 million and the accrued interest on the 2019 Notes was $0.2 million. Pursuant to their terms, the 2019 Notes were settled in 2,921,461 shares of our common stock upon the closing of our IPO at a settlement price of $13.60 per share, which is equal to 85% of the IPO price per share.\nDebt Obligations\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIn addition, we have entered into the Duke License, under which we are obligated to make aggregate future milestone payments of up to $0.2 million upon the achievement of specified corporate milestones as well as low-single digit percent royalty payments based on future net sales of applicable products and specified royalties based on sublicensing revenue. See Business-License and Collaboration Agreements\u201d for more information regarding our payment obligations under the Duke License. We have not included future payments under the Duke License in the table above since the payment obligations under the Duke License are contingent upon future events, such as the achievement of specified milestones or generating product sales, and we are unable to estimate the timing or likelihood of achieving these milestones or generating future product sales. We have also not included our contractual payment obligations under the Duke License in connection with the upfront payment under the Development and License Agreement with Lilly in the table above since, as of December 31, 2020, the completion of the transactions contemplated by the Development and License Agreement had not closed. We closed the transactions under the Development and License Agreement on January 6, 2021 following receipt of clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and as a result we will be required to make payments under the Duke License of $3.0 million in 2021, net of any outstanding credits. See Note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Development and License Agreement.\nThrough our wholly owned subsidiary, Elo, in June 2020, we entered into a Research, Development, and Commercialization Agreement with Dole with the aim to co-develop banana varieties resistant to Foc TR4, utilizing proprietary computational biology workflows and the ARCUS genome editing platform. The disease caused by Foc TR4, commonly known as Fusarium wilt, threatens the continued cultivation of the world's most popular variety of banana called Cavendish, which is of considerable economic significance as this variety is used to produce export bananas for key markets around the globe and Dole is one of the largest\n \u2022 salaries, benefits and other related costs, including share-based compensation expense, for personnel engaged in research and development functions; \nOverview\n \u2022 the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any product candidates for which we or our collaborators obtain marketing approval. \nEmerging Growth Company Status\n (3) This table does not reflect principal and interest payments payable pursuant to our Pacific Western Loan Agreement, pursuant to which we may request advances on the Revolving Line of up to an aggregate principal of $30.0 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had no borrowings under our Revolving Line and, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the maturity date of the Revolving Line is June 23, 2023. The Revolving Line bears interest at a variable annual rate equal to the greater of (a) 2.75% above the Prime Rate (as defined in the Original Agreement), and (b) 6.00%. If the Revolving Line is terminated prior to the maturity date, we are required to pay an early termination fee equal to $0.6 million. Upon maturity or termination of the revolving line, then we are required to pay an amount equal to 1% of the maximum principal amount of the advances outstanding at any time. \nFunding Requirements\nContractual Obligations\nThe increase in direct research and development expenses for our CD19 program was primarily due to increases in CMO and research organization costs as we continue to enroll additional patients in the Phase 1/2a clinical trial. The decrease in direct research and development expenses for our CD20 and BCMA programs was primarily due to decreases in external CMO costs as we transferred clinical trial material manufacturing activities for CD20 and BCMA in-house to MCAT.\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, together with the changes in those items in dollars:\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of therapeutic and agricultural products, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate revenue from product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be required to raise additional capital on terms that are unfavorable to us or we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.\nIn September 2020, we entered into a Clinical Trial Collaboration Agreement with SpringWorks. Pursuant to the agreement, PBCAR269A will be evaluated in combination with nirogacestat, SpringWorks' investigational GSI, in patients with R/R multiple myeloma. Under the terms of the agreement, we will bear all costs with the conduct of the clinical trial including providing PBCAR269A for use in the trial, and SpringWorks is responsible for providing nirogacestat at its sole cost and expense.\n \u2022 license payments made for intellectual property used in research and development activities; and \nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates. We expect that our research and development and general and administrative costs will continue to increase, including in connection with conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates, contracting with CROs and CMOs, the addition of laboratory equipment to MCAT in support of preclinical studies and clinical trials, expanding our intellectual property portfolio and providing general and administrative support for our operations. As a result, we will need additional capital to fund our operations, which we may obtain from additional equity or debt financings, collaborations, licensing arrangements or other sources.\nThe following tables summarize segment revenues and segment operating loss (see Note 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our segments):\n \u2022 the progress, costs and results of our clinical development for our CD19, CD19B, CD20, and BCMA programs as we progress clinical trials, including CRO costs; \nSince our inception in 2006, we have generated cumulative federal and state net operating loss and research and development ( R&D\u201d) credit carryforwards for which we have not recorded any net tax benefit due to the uncertainty around utilizing these tax attributes within their respective carryforward periods. As of December 31, 2020, we had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $172.7 million, $116.5 million, and $0.6 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future taxable income. A portion of the U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards in the amount of $19.7 million will begin to expire in 2030 while the remaining federal net operating loss carryforwards of $153.0 million carry forward indefinitely. The state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2025. The foreign net operating losses carryforward indefinitely. As of December 31, 2020, we also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of $9.9 million, which begin to expire in 2027, and an amount less than $0.1 million, which begin to expire in 2030. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had federal Orphan Drug credits of $6.0 million and $1.8 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2038. As of December 31, 2020, we also have federal contribution carryforwards of $0.2 million, which begin to expire in 2021. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at each balance sheet date.\nWe are closely monitoring how the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect our employees, business, preclinical studies and clinical trials. The Company has taken steps in line with guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC\u201d) and the State of North Carolina to protect the health and safety of its employees and the community. We have implemented measures to mitigate exposure risks and support operations. We initiated a health and safety program addressing mandatory use of face masks, social distancing, sanitary handwashing practices, use of personal protective equipment stations, stringent cleaning and sanitization of all facilities and measures to reduce total occupancy in facilities. We have also implemented temperature and symptom screening procedures at each location, and we have continuously communicated to all our Precisioneers that if they are not comfortable coming to work, regardless of role, then they do not have to do so. Per guidance from the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, our employees are considered essential workforce and may receive the COVID-19 vaccination as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defined Group 3 and Group 4.\nInterest income consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents.\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2.4 million, compared to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $0.8 million was primarily attributable to $0.8 million from an agreement with a new collaboration partner entered into during the year ended December 31, 2020. Segment operational cash expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $7.6 million, compared to $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $0.6 million was primarily due to an increase in employee costs and rent payments, partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures for fixed assets. Segment operating loss decreased $0.2 million from $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the factors discussed above. As discussed above, we are assessing various options with respect to a potential separation of Elo from Precision, which could occur during 2021.\n \u2022 costs of laboratory supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing preclinical study and clinical trial materials; \nWe evaluate the operating performance of each segment based on segment operating loss. Segment operating loss is derived by deducting operational cash expenditures, net, from GAAP revenue. Operational cash expenditures are cash disbursements made that are specifically identifiable to the reportable segment (including specifically identifiable research and development and property, equipment and software expenditures). The reportable segment operational cash expenditures include cash disbursements for compensation, laboratory supplies, purchases of property, equipment and software and procuring services from CROs, CMOs and research organizations. We do not allocate general operational expenses or non-cash income statement amounts to our reportable segments.\n \u2022 CROs and other third parties in connection with performing research and development activities, conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf; \nUntil such time, if ever, that we can generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public or private equity or debt financings, collaboration agreements, other third-party funding, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and marketing and/or distribution arrangements.\nWe elected on issuance to account for the convertible notes payable we issued in March 2019, or the 2019 Notes, at fair value until their settlement. The change in fair value of the 2019 Notes was recognized through the statement of operations. The 2019 Notes settled into 2,921,461 shares of common stock on the closing of our IPO on April 1, 2019.\nWe expect our operating expenses to increase substantially in connection with the expansion of our product development programs and capabilities. We will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for one of our product candidates or the product candidates of our collaborators for which we may receive milestone payments or royalties. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our commercialization capability to support product sales, marketing and distribution. In addition, we expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.\n \u2022 the outcome, timing and cost of meeting regulatory requirements established by the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities; \n \u2022 the costs and timing of internal process development and manufacturing scale-up activities and contract with CMOs associated with our CD19, CD19B, CD20, and BCMA programs and other programs we advance through preclinical and clinical development; \n \u2022 expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, including contract research organizations, or CROs, and other third parties that conduct preclinical research and development activities and clinical trials on our behalf; \n \u2022 the scope, progress, results and costs of any product candidates that we may derive from ARCUS or any other product candidates we may develop alone or with collaborators; \n (1) Represents future minimum lease payments under our leases for office and/or lab space at the following locations: 302 East Pettigrew Street, Durham, North Carolina expiring in July 2024, 3054 Cornwallis Road, Durham, North Carolina expiring in April 2026 and 20 TW Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina expiring in August 2027. The lease obligations amounts above also represent future minimum lease payments on the MCAT Expansion Space as we are contractually obligated to make such payments on the MCAT Expansion Space notwithstanding that the lease commencement date for accounting purposes was not reached as of December 31, 2020 (see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on these lease agreements). \nWe adopted Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606, on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method. Under this method, results for reporting periods beginning on January 1, 2019 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition ( ASC 605\u201d). ASC 606 applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards. Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\n \u2022 the timing and receipt of any marketing approvals; and \nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\n \u2022 our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other agreements and the financial terms of such agreements; \nIn January 2021, we announced that the FDA has accepted our IND application for PBCAR19B, our next-generation, stealth cell, CD19 allogenic CAR T candidate for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, and we expect to begin the Phase 1 study by mid-2021. Additionally, in January 2021, we announced that we received a Notice of Allowance from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for a patent application covering PBCAR19B. The allowed composition claims of this patent application encompass genetically-modified human T cells comprising the PBCAR19B construct, which is inserted within the T cell receptor alpha constant locus. Once issued, patents arising from this patent family will have standard expiration dates in April 2040. In preclinical studies, PBCAR19B has shown to delay both T cell and natural killer cell mediated allogeneic rejection in vitro and may improve the persistence of allogeneic CAR T cells.\n \u2022 the progress, costs and results of our additional research and preclinical development programs; \nCash Used in Operating Activities\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, costs and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors\nRevenue\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $36.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $27.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $9.1 million was primarily due to an increase of $4.0 million in employee-related expense as we increased our general and administrative headcount, $2.9 million in consulting fees, and $2.5 million in increased administrative expenses, including insurance, information technology, franchise and property taxes, and costs related to operating as a public company, partially offset by a $0.3 million decrease in bank fees and other general and administrative expenses.\nWe recognized $3.9 million and $13.3 million in revenue under the Gilead Agreement during the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, and $1.5 million in deferred revenue as of December 31, 2019. We did not receive any milestone payments under the Gilead Agreement during the years ended December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019.\nAt contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we evaluate the performance obligations promised in the contract that are based on goods and services that will be transferred to the customer and determine whether those obligations are both (i) capable of being distinct and (ii) distinct in the context of the contract. Goods or services that meet these criteria are considered distinct performance obligations. If both these criteria are not met, the goods and services are combined into a single performance obligation. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied. Arrangements that include rights to additional goods or services that are exercisable at a customer's discretion are generally considered options. We assess if these options provide a material right to the customer and, if so, these options are considered performance obligations. The exercise of a material right is accounted for as a contract modification for accounting purposes.\nUnless earlier terminated, the Development and License Agreement will remain in effect on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the expiration of a defined royalty term for each licensed product and country. Lilly has the right to terminate the Development and License Agreement for convenience by providing advance notice to us. Either party may terminate the Development and License Agreement (i) for material breach by the other party and a failure to cure such breach within the time period specified in the agreement or (ii) due to a challenge to its patents brought by the other party.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, shareholders' ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our shareholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through other third-party funding, collaboration agreements, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, product development and research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nInterest Expense\nthat we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses by product candidate or development program for the periods presented:\n \u2022 costs of developing and scaling our manufacturing process and manufacturing drug products for use in our preclinical studies and ongoing and future clinical trials, including the costs of contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, and our MCAT facility that will manufacture our clinical trial material for use in our preclinical studies and ongoing and potential future clinical trials; \nany other pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease may materially and adversely impact our business, including our preclinical studies and clinical trials.\u201d in Part I, Item 1A. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn January 2021, we disclosed our intention to spinout our wholly owned subsidiary, Elo. We are continuing to explore our strategic options, and the timing of any such sale, spinout or other treatment of Elo remains uncertain.\n \u2022 the scope, rate of progress, expense and results of clinical trials of our CD19, CD19B, CD20, and BCMA product candidates, as well as of any future clinical trials of other product candidates and other research and development activities that we may conduct; \n \u2022 the extent to which we in-license or acquire rights to other products, product candidates or technologies; \nInterest expense of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 consists of interest from the 2019 Notes at a rate of 6% per annum.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nCargill, Inc.\nOur primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, which consist primarily of research and development and general and administrative expenses. Our losses have resulted from expenses incurred in connection with our research and development activities, including our clinical programs, preclinical development activities, and general and administrative costs associated with our operations. The use of cash in operating activities during the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 resulted from our net loss adjusted for non-cash expenses and changes in working capital.\nIn April 2020, we commenced patient dosing in a Phase 1/2a clinical trial with our second allogeneic CAR T cell therapy product candidate, PBCAR20A. PBCAR20A is wholly owned by us and targets the validated tumor cell surface target CD20. It is being investigated in R/R NHL, including those with R/R chronic lymphocytic leukemia, CLL, or R/R small lymphocytic lymphoma, or SLL. A subset of the NHL patients will have the diagnosis of MCL and we have received orphan drug designation for PBCAR20A from the FDA for the treatment of this disease. Based on the safety profile observed to date with PBCAR0191, the FDA allowed us to commence dosing with PBCAR20A directly at 1 x 106 cells/kg. The study has continued to escalate through dose level two (3 x 106 cells/kg), and, in February 2021, we commenced patient dosing at dose level 3 (480 x 106 cell fixed dose) with a max dose of 6 x 106 cells/kg. We expect to report interim data for the PBCAR20A study in 2021.\nInterest income was $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease of $3.5 million of interest income generated on our cash and cash equivalent balances was the result of lower interest rates and lower cash balances in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nRoyalties - For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on a level of sales, which are the result of a customer-vendor relationship and for which the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied or partially satisfied. To date, we have not recognized any royalty revenue resulting from any of our licensing arrangements.\n \u2022 costs of outside consultants, including their fees and related travel expenses; \n\n\nIn October 2020, we entered into Amendment No. 6 to the Servier Agreement, effective as of October 2, 2020 ( Amendment No. 6\u201d). Terms of the Servier Agreement were amended, solely as applicable to PBCAR0191. Under Amendment No. 6, we are required to complete the ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trial of PBCAR0191 in adult patients with R/R NHL and R/R B-ALL (the Clinical Trial\u201d) for a specified number of patients in the Phase 1 portion of the Clinical Trial and a number of patients to be determined by us in the\nWe recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over time, and if over time this is based on the use of an output or input method.\nThere are no assurances that we will be successful in obtaining an adequate level of financing as and when needed to finance our operations on terms acceptable to us or at all, particularly in light of the economic downturn and ongoing uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic. If we are unable to secure adequate additional funding as and when needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more product candidates. In addition, the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our liquidity and future funding requirements remains uncertain as of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as the pandemic continues to evolve globally. See Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d above and Risk Factors- The ongoing novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19 has impacted our business and any other pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease may materially and adversely impact our business, including our preclinical studies and clinical trials\u201d in Part I, Item 1A. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.\nIn February 2016, we entered into the Servier Agreement, pursuant to which we have agreed to develop allogeneic CAR T cell therapies for five unique antigen targets. One target was selected at the agreement's inception. Two additional hematological cancer targets beyond CD19 and two new solid tumor targets were selected in 2020. With the addition of these new targets, we received development milestone payments in 2020 and may be eligible to receive additional development milestone payments in 2021. We may also be eligible to receive option fees, as well as clinical, regulatory and sales milestone payments in addition to royalties on product sales. Upon selection of an antigen target under the agreement, we have agreed to perform early-stage research and development on individual T cell modifications for the selected target, develop the resulting therapeutic product candidates through Phase 1 clinical trials and prepare initial clinical trial material of such product candidates for use in Phase 2 clinical trials.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nproducers in the industry. Fungicides, or other traditional means of disease control have failed as the pandemic continues to spread across vital banana growing economies. Development of Foc TR4 varieties is critically important to save the banana industry, to protect the livelihoods of millions of banana growers and continue to provide consumers an affordable and nutritious fruit. Under the terms of the collaboration, Dole will fully fund research and development efforts executed by Elo, and Elo is eligible to receive royalties on any commercialized plant product.\nPhase 2a portion of the Clinical Trial. We will be solely responsible for all costs and expenses we incur to complete the Clinical Trial, including the production and release of all required clinical trial material.\n (2) We have entered into a license agreement with an undisclosed licensee for intellectual property used in our research programs. The agreement requires us to pay annual license fees and milestones payments for achievement of specified clinical and commercial events. We have excluded these potential milestone payments in the contractual obligations table because the timing and likelihood of these contingent payments are not currently known and would be difficult to predict or estimate. \nFood Segment Collaborations\nOn December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into United States law. The TCJA includes a number of changes to existing tax law, including, among other things, a permanent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from a top marginal tax rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, effective as of January 1, 2018, as well as a limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of annual taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, in each case, for losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 (though any such net operating losses may be carried forward indefinitely). The federal tax rate change resulted in a reduction in the gross amount of our deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2017, and a corresponding reduction in our valuation allowance. As a result, no income tax expense or benefit was recognized as of the enactment date of the TCJA.\nOur revenues are generated primarily through collaborative research, license, development and commercialization agreements. The terms of these agreements generally contain multiple elements, or deliverables, which may include (1) licenses, or options to obtain licenses, to use our technology, (2) research and development activities to be performed on behalf of the collaborative partner, and (3) in certain cases, services in connection with the manufacturing of preclinical and clinical material. Payments we receive under these arrangements typically include one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; option exercise fees; funding of research and/or development efforts; clinical and development, regulatory, and sales milestone payments; and royalties on future product sales. We classify payments received under these agreements as revenues within our consolidated statements of operations.\nUnder the guidance of ASC 606, certain judgments affect revenue recognition. Our primary performance obligations under our agreements consist of research and development services. Measuring the amount of time it takes for us to complete these services includes estimating our total effort to satisfy our performance obligations at the outset of the agreement and then comparing that amount to the actual effort expended for a given accounting period. In certain instances, significant judgment is required to estimate the timing of satisfying these obligations and timing may change due to efforts beyond our control, such as changes in the customer's direction of a particular research program or changes to the contractual terms of an agreement. Accordingly, our estimates may change in the future. Such changes to estimates will result in a change in prospective revenue recognition amounts.\nInterest Income\nAs a result of these anticipated expenditures, we will need additional financing to support our continuing operations. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public equity, debt financings or other sources, which may include current and new collaborations with third parties. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our inability to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. We cannot assure you that we will ever generate significant revenue to achieve profitability.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nupfront cash proceeds from strategic partnerships on terms and conditions reasonably satisfactory to PWB, the maturity date shall then instead be June 23, 2023. Under the terms of Amendment No. 3, the interest rate increased to a variable annual rate equal to the greater of (a) 2.75% above the Prime Rate (as defined in the Original Agreement), and (b) 6.00%. The Company must also maintain an aggregate balance of unrestricted cash at PWB (not including amounts in certain specified accounts) equal to or greater than $10.0 million.\nIn October 2020, we announced the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's PTAB issued judgements in our favor in two patent interference proceedings that challenged nine U.S. patents we owned. The patents, which issued in 2018, relate to allogeneic CAR T cells produced by inserting a gene encoding a CAR into the TRAC locus, as well as methods of using those cells for cancer immunotherapy. In the interference proceedings, a third party argued that it had invented the technology in 2012. The PTAB, however, found that the third-party patent application did not satisfy the written description requirement and rejected these claims while maintaining the claims in all nine of our patents.\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase substantially for the foreseeable future and will comprise a larger percentage of our total expenses as we continue our Phase 1/2a clinical trials for our CD19, CD20 and BCMA product candidates, commence our Phase 1 clinical trial of CD19B, and continue to discover and develop additional product candidates.\nTherapeutics Segment\nWe analyze our collaboration arrangements to assess whether they are within the scope of ASU No. 2018-18 Collaborative Arrangements, or ASC 808, to determine whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities. This assessment is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in the responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement. For collaboration arrangements within the scope of ASC 808 that contain multiple elements, we first determine which elements of the collaboration are deemed to be within the scope of ASC 808 and those that are more reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and, therefore, are within the scope of ASC 606. For elements of collaboration arrangements that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 808, an appropriate recognition method is determined and applied consistently, generally by analogy to ASC 606. For those elements of the arrangement that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 606, we apply the five-step model described above.\nSpringWorks Therapeutics\nWe are working closely with our clinical sites, physician partners and the patient community to monitor and manage the impact of the evolving COVID-19 pandemic. We remain committed to our clinical programs and development plans, however, disruptions, competing resource demands and safety concerns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have caused, and are likely to continue to cause delays in our clinical trial site activation and impact our ability to enroll patients. We may also experience other difficulties, disruptions or delays in conducting preclinical studies or initiating, enrolling, conducting or completing our planned and ongoing clinical trials, and we may incur other unforeseen costs as a result. We expect that the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact our business, including our preclinical studies and clinical trials. At this time, there is still significant uncertainty relating to the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic and impact of related responses. The impact of COVID-19 on our preclinical studies and any further impact to our clinical trials will largely depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate geographic spread of the disease, the duration of the pandemic, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on financial markets and the global economy, and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease. The Coronavirus, Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act ( CARES Act\u201d) was signed into law on March 27, 2020, which provides for, among other things, the deferral of the deposit and payment of certain taxes. Pursuant to the CARES Act, the Company elected to defer payment of the employer's share of social security taxes incurred between May 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020. See Risk Factors- The outbreak of the ongoing novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19 has impacted our business, or and\nAs of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there have been no borrowings under our Revolving Line, and we are in compliance with the financial covenants under the Pacific Western Loan Agreement.\nany combination of common and preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units of up to $200.0 million in the aggregate.

The higher cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, was due to proceeds received from our IPO, which closed in April 2019, and proceeds from the 2019 Notes, which were issued in March 2019. Financing activities in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 related to cash proceeds received from stock option exercise and our employee stock purchase plan.\n \u2022 significant and changing government regulation and regulatory guidance; \nA description of recent accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows is disclosed in Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \u2022 facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs if specifically identifiable to research activities. \nResearch and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $98.1 million, compared to $82.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $15.7 million was primarily due to a $16.2 million increase in platform development and early-stage research expenses, a $3.9 million increase in direct research and development expenses related to our CD19 program, partially offset by decreases of $2.7 and $1.8 in direct research and development expenses related to our CD20 and BCMA programs, respectively.\nIn September 2020, we regained full clinical development and commercialization rights, and all data we generated for the in vivo chronic HBV program developed under our 2018 collaboration agreement with Gilead Sciences. We are exploring partnership or alternative opportunities to enable the continued development of ARCUS-based HBV therapies.\nImpact of COVID-19 Pandemic\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019\nIn January 2021, we and Lilly closed the Development and License Agreement following clearance under the Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the HSR Act\u201d). In connection with the closing, we received an upfront cash payment of $100.0 million as well as $35.0 million from Lilly's purchase of 3,762,190 newly issued shares of our common stock pursuant to a stock purchase agreement as described below (the Stock Purchase Agreement\u201d). We will also be eligible to receive milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $420 million per licensed product as well as nomination fees for additional targets and certain research funding. If licensed products resulting from the collaboration are approved and sold, we will also be entitled to receive tiered royalties ranging from the mid-single digit percentages to the low-teens percentages on world-wide net sales of the licensed products, subject to customary potential reductions. Lilly's obligation to pay royalties to us expires on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis, upon the latest to occur of certain events related to expiration of patents, regulatory exclusivity or a period of ten years following first commercial sale of the licensed product.\nSince our formation in 2006, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing ARCUS, conducting research and development activities, recruiting skilled personnel, developing manufacturing processes, establishing our intellectual property portfolio and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from upfront payments from collaboration and licensing agreements, our IPO, and private placements of convertible preferred stock and convertible debt.\n\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated costs incurred for the services when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to the following:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nMilestone Payments - If an arrangement includes development and regulatory milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee's control, such as regulatory approvals, are generally not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nEli Lilly and Company\nWe cannot determine with certainty the duration and costs of ongoing and future clinical trials of our CD19, CD19B, CD20, and BCMA product candidates, or any other product candidate we may develop or if, when or to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. We may never succeed in obtaining marketing approval for any product candidate. The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our CD19, CD19B, CD20, and BCMA product candidates, and any other our product candidate we may develop will depend on a variety of factors, including:\nWe base our expenses related to preclinical studies on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with CROs that conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials and CMOs that manufacture product for our\nIn May 2019, we entered into the Pacific Western Loan Agreement with PWB as amended by the First Amendment to Loan and Security Amendment, effective September 18, 2019, the Second Amendment to Loan and Security Amendment, effective December 3, 2019 (the Original Agreement\u201d). On June 23, 2020, the Company and PWB entered into the Third Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement (the Amendment No. 3\u201d) to the Original Agreement (as amended, the Pacific Western Loan Agreement\u201d). The terms of Amendment No. 3 (a) decrease the aggregate principal amount of advances on a revolving line of credit (the Revolving Line\u201d) from $50.0 million to $30.0 million and (b) extend the maturity date of the Revolving Line to June 23, 2022, provided that, if the Company receives aggregate cash proceeds of at least $125.0 million from the issuance of the Company's equity securities and/or\nSegment Results\nCash used in investing activities primarily relates to leasehold additions, equipment and software. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $5.0 million, compared to $24.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to the completion of the build-out of our MCAT facility in Research Triangle Park and other leased facilities in 2019.\nServier\nPlatform development and early-stage research expenses increased primarily due to a $10.9 million increase in employee-related expense associated with increased headcount to support our technology platform development and manufacturing capabilities, a $6.0 million increase in CMO and research organization expense, primarily related to our planned CD19B clinical trial, a $3.3 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense driven by our higher depreciable asset base during the year ended December 31, 2020, and a $0.3 million increase in facility-related expenses, partially offset by a $4.9 million decrease in outsourced research and development expense in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\n \u2022 the expense of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights. \nIn January 2018, we entered into a research, collaboration and license agreement with the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania ( Penn\u201d) to collaborate on the preclinical development for gene editing products involving the delivery of an ARCUS nuclease. On April 29, 2020, both parties agreed to coordinate a wind-down of all activities in their entirety under the agreement, effective as of June 30, 2020, however, in August 2020 and subsequently in January 2021, both parties agreed to extend certain portions of the agreement until 2022. We will not be required to make termination payments to Penn.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nDole Food Company\nRevenue\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our discovery efforts and the development of our product candidates. These include the following:\nSignificant Financing Component - In determining the transaction price, we adjust consideration for the effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments provides us with a significant benefit of financing. We do not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the expectation at contract inception is such that the period between payment by the licensees and the transfer of the promised goods or services to the licensees will be one year or less. We assessed each of our revenue arrangements in order to determine whether a significant financing component exists and concluded that a significant financing component does not exist in any of our arrangements.\nWe currently conduct our operations through two reportable segments: Therapeutics and Food. Our Therapeutics segment is focused on allogeneic CAR T immunotherapy and in vivo gene correction. Our Food segment focuses on applying ARCUS to develop food and nutrition products through collaboration agreements with consumer-facing companies.\n \u2022 the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against any intellectual property-related claims; and \nThe following is a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2020:\nRevenue Recognition\nresearch and development activities on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or amount of prepaid expense accordingly.\nChange in Fair Value of Convertible Notes Payable\nWe do not currently have any approved products and have never generated any revenue from product sales. Through the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from our IPO, private placements of our convertible preferred stock, convertible debt and common stock, and upfront payments from collaboration and licensing arrangements. As of December 31, 2020, we had raised approximately $492.5 million of proceeds from third parties through a combination of financings including our IPO, preferred stock and convertible note financings, payments under the Servier Agreement, and funding from other strategic alliances and grants. We also currently have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-238857) filed with the SEC on June 1, 2020 (the Form S-3\u201d) under which we may offer from time to time in one or more offerings\nWe will remain an emerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more, (2) December 31, 2024, (3) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years or (4) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC, which means the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, we have been a public company for at least 12 months and have filed one Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Pacific Western Loan Agreement matures on June 23, 2023, as a result of the events discussed in Note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the periods presented:\nInterest Income\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including share-based compensation, for personnel in our executive, finance, business development, operations and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters; professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services; insurance costs; travel expenses; and facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs that are not specifically attributable to research activities.\nAdditionally, in June 2020, Elo, our wholly-owned subsidiary, established a strategic partnership with the Dole and entered into a Research, Development, and Commercialization Agreement with Dole, with the aim to co-develop banana varieties resistant to Foc TR4, utilizing proprietary computational biology workflows and the ARCUS genome editing platform. The disease caused by Foc TR4, commonly known as Fusarium wilt, threatens the continued cultivation of the world's most popular variety of banana called Cavendish, which is of considerable economic significance as this variety is used to produce export bananas for key markets around the globe and Dole is one of the largest producers in the industry. Fungicides, or other traditional means of disease control have failed as the pandemic continues to spread across vital banana growing economies.\nIn November 2020, we announced a research collaboration and exclusive license agreement with Lilly to utilize ARCUS for the research and development of potential in vivo therapies for genetic disorders, with an initial focus on DMD and two other undisclosed gene targets. Under the agreement, Lilly has the right to nominate up to three additional gene targets for genetic disorders over the first four years of the Development and License Agreement, which may be extended to six years upon Lilly's election and payment of an extension fee.\nIn February 2016, we entered into the Servier Agreement for the licensing of our ARCUS proprietary genome editing platform and the research, development, and manufacturing of product for clinical trials and commercialization of products. In September 2018, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Gilead, which we refer to as the Gilead Agreement, to develop genome editing tools using our ARCUS proprietary genome editing platform. Both agreements use our genome editing technology for the treatment of certain diseases. Consideration we received, or may receive, under these collaboration and license agreements include upfront nonrefundable payments, research funding payments and payments based upon the achievement of certain milestones and royalties on any resulting net product sales.\nTrustees of the University of Pennsylvania\nGilead\nTherapeutics Segment Collaborations\nUnder the Servier Agreement, we recognized $18.0 million and $7.3 million in revenue during the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The amount recorded as deferred revenue was $82.9 million and $80.9 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\n \u2022 uncertainties in clinical trial design and patient enrollment rates; \nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or if we experience significant delays in our clinical trials due to slower than expected patient enrollment or other reasons, we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.\nWe are a life sciences company dedicated to improving life through the application of our pioneering, proprietary ARCUS genome editing platform. We leverage ARCUS in the development of our product candidates, which are designed to treat human diseases and create healthy and sustainable food and agricultural solutions. We are actively developing product candidates in three innovative areas: allogeneic CAR T cell immunotherapy, in vivo gene correction, and food. We are currently conducting a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of PBCAR0191 in adult patients with relapsed or refractory, or R/R, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or NHL, or R/R B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or B-ALL. PBCAR0191 is our first gene-edited allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, T cell therapy candidate targeting CD19 and is being developed in collaboration with Servier pursuant to the Servier Agreement. We have received orphan drug designation for PBCAR0191 from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA\u201d), for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL. In August 2020, the FDA granted Fast Track Designation for PBCAR0191 for the treatment of B-ALL. The NHL cohort will include patients with mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL\u201d), an aggressive subtype of NHL, for which we have received orphan drug designation from the FDA. Made from donor-derived T cells modified using our ARCUS genome editing technology, PBCAR0191 recognizes the well characterized tumor cell surface protein CD19, an important and validated target in several B-cell cancers, and is designed to avoid graft-versus-host disease, or GvHD, a significant complication associated with donor-derived, cell-based therapies. We believe that this trial, which is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of PBCAR0191 at increasing dose levels, as well as to evaluate anti-tumor activity, is the first U.S.-based clinical trial to evaluate an allogeneic CAR T therapy for R/R NHL. Furthermore, we believe that our proprietary, one-step engineering process for producing allogeneic CAR T cells with a potentially optimized cell phenotype, at large scale in a cost-effective manner, will enable us to overcome the fundamental clinical and manufacturing challenges that have limited the CAR T field to date. We expect to report updated interim data for the PBCAR0191 study in mid-year 2021.\nIn December 2020, we announced interim clinical results from our Phase 1/2a study of PBCAR0191 as a treatment of R/R NHL and R/R B-ALL. As of the November 16, 2020 cutoff, 27 patients including 16 patients with aggressive NHL and 11 patients with aggressive B-ALL were enrolled and evaluated. In this dose escalation and dose expansion study, PBCAR0191 had an acceptable safety profile with no cases of graft versus host disease, no cases of Grade \u2265 3 cytokine release syndrome, and no cases of Grade \u2265 3 neurotoxicity. PBCAR0191 demonstrated longest durability of response to 11 months in B-ALL. PBCAR0191 with eLD resulted in objective response rate of 83% (5/6) in NHL and B-ALL as compared to 33% (3/9) in NHL with sLD.\n\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020, cash payments received from Lilly in January 2021 in connection with the closing of the Development and License Agreement, expected operational receipts and available credit will allow us to continue its operations into 2023. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be imprecise, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical and agricultural products, it is difficult to estimate with certainty the amount of our working capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\nInterest expense consists of interest from the 2019 Notes at a rate of 6% per annum.\nWe expect to advance a program targeting the rare genetic disease PH1 as our lead wholly owned in vivo gene correction program. PH1 affects approximately 1-3 people per million in the United States and is caused by loss of function mutations in the AGXT gene, leading to the accumulation of calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys. Patients suffer from painful kidney stones which may ultimately lead to renal failure. Using ARCUS, we are developing a potential therapeutic approach to PH1 that involves knocking out a gene called HAO1 which acts upstream of AGXT. Suppressing HAO1 has been shown in preclinical models by us to prevent the formation of calcium oxalate. We therefore believe that a one-time administration of an ARCUS nuclease targeting HAO1 may be a viable strategy for a durable treatment of PH1 patients. Pre-clinical research has continued to progress, and we expect to provide an update on this program in the first half of 2021.\n \u2022 the actual probability of success for our product candidates, including their safety and efficacy, early clinical data, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability; \nIn June 2020, we commenced patient dosing in a Phase 1/2a clinical trial with our third allogenic CAR T cell therapy product candidate, PBCAR269A. The starting dose of PBCAR269A is 6 x 105 cells/kg. PBCAR269A is wholly owned by us and is designed to target the validated tumor cell surface target BCMA. It is being investigated in subjects with R/R multiple myeloma and we have received orphan drug designation and Fast Track Designation from the FDA for this indication. In September 2020, we announced that we entered into a clinical trial collaboration with SpringWorks, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing medicines for patients with severe rare diseases and cancer. Pursuant to the collaboration, PBCAR269A will be evaluated in combination with nirogacestat, SpringWorks' investigational GSI, in patients with R/R multiple myeloma, which is expected to commence in the first half of 2021. In February 2021, we commenced patient dosing at the highest dose cohort, dose level 3 of 6 x 106 cells/kg and we expect to report interim data on the PBCAR269A trial in 2021.\nWe elected on issuance to account for the 2019 Notes at fair value until their settlement. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized $9.8 million of expense as changes in fair value. The 2019 Notes were settled on the closing of the IPO in April 2019.\nThe results of the Clinical Trial will be used to determine whether specified development milestones have been achieved with respect to PBCAR0191, in which case, specified corresponding development milestone payments are payable by Servier to us. The results of the Clinical Trial will also be used to determine whether Phase 2 readiness has been achieved for PBCAR0191 and Servier may determine whether, subject to payment of a commercial option exercise fee, to exercise its commercial option and proceed with development and commercialization of PBCAR0191. Following completion of the Clinical Trial, we are not obligated to conduct any further development activities under the Servier Agreement with respect to PBCAR0191 unless we otherwise agree to conduct such further development activities.\nIn November 2020, we entered into a research collaboration and exclusive license agreement (the Development and License Agreement\u201d) with Lilly to utilize ARCUS for the research and development of potential in vivo therapies for genetic disorders. Lilly has initially nominated DMD and two gene targets for other genetic disorders, and has the right to nominate up to three additional gene targets for genetic disorders over the first four years of the Development and License Agreement (the Nomination Period\u201d). Lilly may extend the Nomination Period for an additional two years from the date on which such initial Nomination Period ends, upon Lilly's election and payment of an extension fee. Under the terms of the Development and License Agreement, Lilly will receive an exclusive license to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize the resulting licensed products to diagnose, prevent and treat any and all diseases by in vivo gene editing directed against the applicable gene target. The Development and License Agreement provides that we will be responsible for conducting certain pre-clinical research and IND-enabling activities with respect to the gene targets nominated by Lilly to be subject to the collaboration, including manufacture of initial clinical trial material for the first licensed product. Lilly will be responsible for, and must use commercially reasonable efforts with respect to, conducting clinical development and commercialization activities for licensed products resulting from the collaboration, and may engage us for additional clinical and/or initial commercial manufacture of licensed products.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many important factors, including those set forth in Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements. As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires, references to we,\u201d us,\u201d our,\u201d the Company\u201d and Precision\u201d refer to Precision BioSciences, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $21.9 million, compared to $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $1.3 million was the result of a $10.7 increase in collaboration revenue recognized from Servier, partially offset by a $9.5 million decrease in revenue recognized from Gilead due to the termination of the Gilead Agreement. Segment operational cash expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $71.8 million, compared to $70.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $1.7 million in operational cash expenditures was primarily due to an increase in employee costs and payments made to service providers for contract manufacturing and clinical trial research, partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures for fixed assets and a reduction in payments to external vendors for early-stage research. Segment operating loss increased $0.6 million from $49.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $50.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the factors discussed above.\nOn April 1, 2019, we completed our IPO of 9,085,000 shares of common stock, including the underwriters' full exercise of their option to purchase an additional 1,185,000 additional shares of common stock, at an offering price of $16.00 per share, for net proceeds of approximately $130.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us. As of December 31, 2020, we have generated approximately $492.5 million from third parties to date.\nOur cash and cash equivalents totaled $89.8 million as of December 31, 2020, compared to $180.9 million as of December 31, 2019.\nCash Flows\nShare-Based Compensation\n \u2022 increased costs of additional clinical sites to address slowed enrollment due to the impact of COVID-19; \nInterest Expense\nWe expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we continue research activities and development of product candidates.\nWe have the right to elect to co-fund the clinical development of one licensed product, which may be selected from among the third or any subsequent licensed products to reach IND filing. If we elect to co-fund such licensed product, we would reimburse Lilly for a portion of the clinical development expenses for such product and, in exchange, each royalty tier with respect to net sales of such licensed product would be increased by a low single digit percentage. During the term of the Development and License Agreement, we may not (and may not license or collaborate with any third party to) research, develop, or commercialize any in vivo gene editing product directed against any gene targets that have been nominated and are subject to the Development and License Agreement.\nOn July 6, 2020, Gilead Sciences ( Gilead\u201d) notified us of its termination of the collaboration and license agreement dated September 10, 2018, subsequently amended by Amendment No. 1 dated March 10, 2020 or (the Gilead Agreement\u201d), to develop genome editing tools using ARCUS to target viral DNA associated with the hepatitis B virus. Pursuant to the termination notice, the Gilead Agreement terminated on September 4, 2020. Upon termination, we regained full rights and all data we generated for the in vivo chronic hepatitis B program developed under the Gilead Agreement.\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC rules.\nCash Provided by Financing Activities\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. We track external research and development costs, including the costs of laboratory supplies and services, outsourced research and development, clinical trials, contract manufacturing, laboratory equipment and maintenance and certain other development costs, by product candidate when the program IND application is accepted by the FDA. Internal and external costs associated with infrastructure resources, other research and development costs, facility related costs and depreciation and amortization that are not identifiable to a specific product candidate are included in the platform development and early-stage research expenses category in the table below.\nIncome Taxes\nChange in Fair Value of Convertible Notes Payable\n \u2022 Vendors in connection with preclinical development activities; and \nWe measure stock options and other share-based awards granted to our employees, directors, consultants and advisors based on the fair value on the date of the grant and recognize compensation expense for those awards, net of actual forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award.", "item_7_text": "Additionally, in December 2020, researchers at Elo in collaboration with Alan Chambers, Ph.D., and the Tropical Research and Education Center at the University of Florida published a paper in Nature Food, reporting a chromosome-scale, phased Vanilla planifolia genome, which revealed sequence variants for genes that may impact the vanillin pathway, and therefore influence bean quality, including its productivity, flower anatomy, and disease resistance.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nIn 2014, through Elo, we and Cargill, Inc. entered into a collaboration to produce ARCUS-optimized canola varieties with significantly lower levels of saturated fatty acids compared to the current levels in greenhouse studies. On July 30, 2020, we and Cargill mutually agreed to terminate the collaboration, effective August 31, 2020.\nCash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $87.4 million, compared to $71.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cash used in operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs associated with increased headcount, increased costs related to our clinical programs with our ongoing CD19 Phase 1/2a clinical trial and initiation of Phase 1/2a clinical trials for our CD20 and BCMA product candidates in 2020, an increase in legal fees and an increase in lease payments.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nOur operating expenses increased substantially in 2020 and are expected to continue to increase in the future in connection with the continuation of our current clinical trials, planned initiation of additional clinical trials and expected growth in our portfolio.\nFood Segment\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $24.3 million, compared to $22.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $2.1 million in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily the result of a $10.7 million increase in collaboration revenue recognized from Servier in connection with the development milestones achieved and work performed on the new targets under the Servier Agreement, a $0.8 million increase in revenue recognized from food segment partners, partially offset by a $9.5 million decrease in revenue recognized from Gilead due to the termination of the Gilead Agreement.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nInvoices issued as stipulated in contracts prior to revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue within current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as noncurrent deferred revenue. Amounts recognized as revenue, but not yet invoiced are generally recognized as contract assets in the Other line item in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nWe estimate the fair value of each stock option grant on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and assumptions we make for the expected volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. As we have limited trading history, we estimate our expected volatility based on the historical volatility of publicly traded peer companies and expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our traded share price. The expected term of our options has been determined utilizing a weighted value considering actual exercise history and estimated expected term based on the midpoint of final vest date and expiration date. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses and have not generated any revenue from the sale of products. Our ability to generate any product revenue or product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates or the product candidates of our collaborators for which we may receive milestone payments or royalties. Our net losses were $109.0 million and $92.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $286.1 million.\nWe are an emerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies are required to comply with those standards. We have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. As an emerging growth company,\u201d we are also exempted from having to provide an auditor attestation of internal control over financial reporting under Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404(b).\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales in the foreseeable future. We record revenue from collaboration agreements, including amounts related to upfront payments, milestone payments, annual fees for licenses of our intellectual property and research and development funding.\n\nWe received an upfront payment of $105.0 million under the Servier Agreement in 2016. We have the ability to receive total payments, including the upfront payment, option fees and milestone payments, in the aggregate across all five targets, of up to approximately $1.4 billion. This includes up to $1.3 billion in milestone payments, consisting of up to $329.3 million in development milestone payments and up to $925.0 million in commercial milestone payments. We are also entitled to receive tiered royalties ranging from the mid-single digit percentages to the sub-teen percentages on worldwide net sales, subject to potential customary reductions. We also have the right to participate in the development and commercialization of any licensed products resulting from the collaboration through a 50/50 co-development and co-promotion option in the United States, subject to our payment of an option fee, which is exercisable after Servier's commercial option exercise.\nWe also enter into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs, CMOs, universities and other third parties for preclinical research studies, clinical trials and testing and manufacturing services. These contracts do not contain minimum purchase commitments and are cancelable by us upon prior written notice. Payments due upon cancellation consist only of payments for services provided or expenses incurred, including non-cancelable obligations of our service providers, up to the date of cancellation. These payments are not included in the table above as the amount and timing of such payments are not known.\nCollaborative Arrangements - We have entered into collaboration agreements, which are within the scope of ASC 606, to discover, develop, manufacture and commercialize product candidates. The terms of these agreements typically contain multiple promises or obligations, which may include: (1) licenses, or options to obtain licenses, to use our technology, (2) research and development activities to be performed on behalf of the collaboration partner, and (3) in certain cases, services in connection with the manufacturing of preclinical and clinical material. Payments we receive under these arrangements typically include one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; option exercise fees; funding of research and/or development efforts; clinical and development, regulatory, and sales milestone payments; and royalties on future product sales.\nIn March 2019, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $39.6 million of 2019 Notes in a private placement transaction. Upon settlement, the change in fair value of the 2019 Notes was $9.8 million and the accrued interest on the 2019 Notes was $0.2 million. Pursuant to their terms, the 2019 Notes were settled in 2,921,461 shares of our common stock upon the closing of our IPO at a settlement price of $13.60 per share, which is equal to 85% of the IPO price per share.\nDebt Obligations\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIn addition, we have entered into the Duke License, under which we are obligated to make aggregate future milestone payments of up to $0.2 million upon the achievement of specified corporate milestones as well as low-single digit percent royalty payments based on future net sales of applicable products and specified royalties based on sublicensing revenue. See Business-License and Collaboration Agreements\u201d for more information regarding our payment obligations under the Duke License. We have not included future payments under the Duke License in the table above since the payment obligations under the Duke License are contingent upon future events, such as the achievement of specified milestones or generating product sales, and we are unable to estimate the timing or likelihood of achieving these milestones or generating future product sales. We have also not included our contractual payment obligations under the Duke License in connection with the upfront payment under the Development and License Agreement with Lilly in the table above since, as of December 31, 2020, the completion of the transactions contemplated by the Development and License Agreement had not closed. We closed the transactions under the Development and License Agreement on January 6, 2021 following receipt of clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and as a result we will be required to make payments under the Duke License of $3.0 million in 2021, net of any outstanding credits. See Note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Development and License Agreement.\nThrough our wholly owned subsidiary, Elo, in June 2020, we entered into a Research, Development, and Commercialization Agreement with Dole with the aim to co-develop banana varieties resistant to Foc TR4, utilizing proprietary computational biology workflows and the ARCUS genome editing platform. The disease caused by Foc TR4, commonly known as Fusarium wilt, threatens the continued cultivation of the world's most popular variety of banana called Cavendish, which is of considerable economic significance as this variety is used to produce export bananas for key markets around the globe and Dole is one of the largest\n \u2022 salaries, benefits and other related costs, including share-based compensation expense, for personnel engaged in research and development functions; \nOverview\n \u2022 the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any product candidates for which we or our collaborators obtain marketing approval. \nEmerging Growth Company Status\n (3) This table does not reflect principal and interest payments payable pursuant to our Pacific Western Loan Agreement, pursuant to which we may request advances on the Revolving Line of up to an aggregate principal of $30.0 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had no borrowings under our Revolving Line and, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the maturity date of the Revolving Line is June 23, 2023. The Revolving Line bears interest at a variable annual rate equal to the greater of (a) 2.75% above the Prime Rate (as defined in the Original Agreement), and (b) 6.00%. If the Revolving Line is terminated prior to the maturity date, we are required to pay an early termination fee equal to $0.6 million. Upon maturity or termination of the revolving line, then we are required to pay an amount equal to 1% of the maximum principal amount of the advances outstanding at any time. \nFunding Requirements\nContractual Obligations\nThe increase in direct research and development expenses for our CD19 program was primarily due to increases in CMO and research organization costs as we continue to enroll additional patients in the Phase 1/2a clinical trial. The decrease in direct research and development expenses for our CD20 and BCMA programs was primarily due to decreases in external CMO costs as we transferred clinical trial material manufacturing activities for CD20 and BCMA in-house to MCAT.\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, together with the changes in those items in dollars:\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of therapeutic and agricultural products, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate revenue from product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be required to raise additional capital on terms that are unfavorable to us or we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.\nIn September 2020, we entered into a Clinical Trial Collaboration Agreement with SpringWorks. Pursuant to the agreement, PBCAR269A will be evaluated in combination with nirogacestat, SpringWorks' investigational GSI, in patients with R/R multiple myeloma. Under the terms of the agreement, we will bear all costs with the conduct of the clinical trial including providing PBCAR269A for use in the trial, and SpringWorks is responsible for providing nirogacestat at its sole cost and expense.\n \u2022 license payments made for intellectual property used in research and development activities; and \nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates. We expect that our research and development and general and administrative costs will continue to increase, including in connection with conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates, contracting with CROs and CMOs, the addition of laboratory equipment to MCAT in support of preclinical studies and clinical trials, expanding our intellectual property portfolio and providing general and administrative support for our operations. As a result, we will need additional capital to fund our operations, which we may obtain from additional equity or debt financings, collaborations, licensing arrangements or other sources.\nThe following tables summarize segment revenues and segment operating loss (see Note 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our segments):\n \u2022 the progress, costs and results of our clinical development for our CD19, CD19B, CD20, and BCMA programs as we progress clinical trials, including CRO costs; \nSince our inception in 2006, we have generated cumulative federal and state net operating loss and research and development ( R&D\u201d) credit carryforwards for which we have not recorded any net tax benefit due to the uncertainty around utilizing these tax attributes within their respective carryforward periods. As of December 31, 2020, we had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $172.7 million, $116.5 million, and $0.6 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future taxable income. A portion of the U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards in the amount of $19.7 million will begin to expire in 2030 while the remaining federal net operating loss carryforwards of $153.0 million carry forward indefinitely. The state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2025. The foreign net operating losses carryforward indefinitely. As of December 31, 2020, we also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of $9.9 million, which begin to expire in 2027, and an amount less than $0.1 million, which begin to expire in 2030. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had federal Orphan Drug credits of $6.0 million and $1.8 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2038. As of December 31, 2020, we also have federal contribution carryforwards of $0.2 million, which begin to expire in 2021. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at each balance sheet date.\nWe are closely monitoring how the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect our employees, business, preclinical studies and clinical trials. The Company has taken steps in line with guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC\u201d) and the State of North Carolina to protect the health and safety of its employees and the community. We have implemented measures to mitigate exposure risks and support operations. We initiated a health and safety program addressing mandatory use of face masks, social distancing, sanitary handwashing practices, use of personal protective equipment stations, stringent cleaning and sanitization of all facilities and measures to reduce total occupancy in facilities. We have also implemented temperature and symptom screening procedures at each location, and we have continuously communicated to all our Precisioneers that if they are not comfortable coming to work, regardless of role, then they do not have to do so. Per guidance from the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, our employees are considered essential workforce and may receive the COVID-19 vaccination as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defined Group 3 and Group 4.\nInterest income consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents.\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2.4 million, compared to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $0.8 million was primarily attributable to $0.8 million from an agreement with a new collaboration partner entered into during the year ended December 31, 2020. Segment operational cash expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $7.6 million, compared to $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $0.6 million was primarily due to an increase in employee costs and rent payments, partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures for fixed assets. Segment operating loss decreased $0.2 million from $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the factors discussed above. As discussed above, we are assessing various options with respect to a potential separation of Elo from Precision, which could occur during 2021.\n \u2022 costs of laboratory supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing preclinical study and clinical trial materials; \nWe evaluate the operating performance of each segment based on segment operating loss. Segment operating loss is derived by deducting operational cash expenditures, net, from GAAP revenue. Operational cash expenditures are cash disbursements made that are specifically identifiable to the reportable segment (including specifically identifiable research and development and property, equipment and software expenditures). The reportable segment operational cash expenditures include cash disbursements for compensation, laboratory supplies, purchases of property, equipment and software and procuring services from CROs, CMOs and research organizations. We do not allocate general operational expenses or non-cash income statement amounts to our reportable segments.\n \u2022 CROs and other third parties in connection with performing research and development activities, conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf; \nUntil such time, if ever, that we can generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public or private equity or debt financings, collaboration agreements, other third-party funding, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and marketing and/or distribution arrangements.\nWe elected on issuance to account for the convertible notes payable we issued in March 2019, or the 2019 Notes, at fair value until their settlement. The change in fair value of the 2019 Notes was recognized through the statement of operations. The 2019 Notes settled into 2,921,461 shares of common stock on the closing of our IPO on April 1, 2019.\nWe expect our operating expenses to increase substantially in connection with the expansion of our product development programs and capabilities. We will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for one of our product candidates or the product candidates of our collaborators for which we may receive milestone payments or royalties. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our commercialization capability to support product sales, marketing and distribution. In addition, we expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.\n \u2022 the outcome, timing and cost of meeting regulatory requirements established by the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities; \n \u2022 the costs and timing of internal process development and manufacturing scale-up activities and contract with CMOs associated with our CD19, CD19B, CD20, and BCMA programs and other programs we advance through preclinical and clinical development; \n \u2022 expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, including contract research organizations, or CROs, and other third parties that conduct preclinical research and development activities and clinical trials on our behalf; \n \u2022 the scope, progress, results and costs of any product candidates that we may derive from ARCUS or any other product candidates we may develop alone or with collaborators; \n (1) Represents future minimum lease payments under our leases for office and/or lab space at the following locations: 302 East Pettigrew Street, Durham, North Carolina expiring in July 2024, 3054 Cornwallis Road, Durham, North Carolina expiring in April 2026 and 20 TW Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina expiring in August 2027. The lease obligations amounts above also represent future minimum lease payments on the MCAT Expansion Space as we are contractually obligated to make such payments on the MCAT Expansion Space notwithstanding that the lease commencement date for accounting purposes was not reached as of December 31, 2020 (see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on these lease agreements). \nWe adopted Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606, on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method. Under this method, results for reporting periods beginning on January 1, 2019 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition ( ASC 605\u201d). ASC 606 applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards. Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\n \u2022 the timing and receipt of any marketing approvals; and \nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\n \u2022 our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other agreements and the financial terms of such agreements; \nIn January 2021, we announced that the FDA has accepted our IND application for PBCAR19B, our next-generation, stealth cell, CD19 allogenic CAR T candidate for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, and we expect to begin the Phase 1 study by mid-2021. Additionally, in January 2021, we announced that we received a Notice of Allowance from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for a patent application covering PBCAR19B. The allowed composition claims of this patent application encompass genetically-modified human T cells comprising the PBCAR19B construct, which is inserted within the T cell receptor alpha constant locus. Once issued, patents arising from this patent family will have standard expiration dates in April 2040. In preclinical studies, PBCAR19B has shown to delay both T cell and natural killer cell mediated allogeneic rejection in vitro and may improve the persistence of allogeneic CAR T cells.\n \u2022 the progress, costs and results of our additional research and preclinical development programs; \nCash Used in Operating Activities\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, costs and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors\nRevenue\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $36.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $27.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $9.1 million was primarily due to an increase of $4.0 million in employee-related expense as we increased our general and administrative headcount, $2.9 million in consulting fees, and $2.5 million in increased administrative expenses, including insurance, information technology, franchise and property taxes, and costs related to operating as a public company, partially offset by a $0.3 million decrease in bank fees and other general and administrative expenses.\nWe recognized $3.9 million and $13.3 million in revenue under the Gilead Agreement during the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, and $1.5 million in deferred revenue as of December 31, 2019. We did not receive any milestone payments under the Gilead Agreement during the years ended December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019.\nAt contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we evaluate the performance obligations promised in the contract that are based on goods and services that will be transferred to the customer and determine whether those obligations are both (i) capable of being distinct and (ii) distinct in the context of the contract. Goods or services that meet these criteria are considered distinct performance obligations. If both these criteria are not met, the goods and services are combined into a single performance obligation. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied. Arrangements that include rights to additional goods or services that are exercisable at a customer's discretion are generally considered options. We assess if these options provide a material right to the customer and, if so, these options are considered performance obligations. The exercise of a material right is accounted for as a contract modification for accounting purposes.\nUnless earlier terminated, the Development and License Agreement will remain in effect on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the expiration of a defined royalty term for each licensed product and country. Lilly has the right to terminate the Development and License Agreement for convenience by providing advance notice to us. Either party may terminate the Development and License Agreement (i) for material breach by the other party and a failure to cure such breach within the time period specified in the agreement or (ii) due to a challenge to its patents brought by the other party.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, shareholders' ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our shareholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through other third-party funding, collaboration agreements, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, product development and research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nInterest Expense\nthat we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses by product candidate or development program for the periods presented:\n \u2022 costs of developing and scaling our manufacturing process and manufacturing drug products for use in our preclinical studies and ongoing and future clinical trials, including the costs of contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, and our MCAT facility that will manufacture our clinical trial material for use in our preclinical studies and ongoing and potential future clinical trials; \nany other pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease may materially and adversely impact our business, including our preclinical studies and clinical trials.\u201d in Part I, Item 1A. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn January 2021, we disclosed our intention to spinout our wholly owned subsidiary, Elo. We are continuing to explore our strategic options, and the timing of any such sale, spinout or other treatment of Elo remains uncertain.\n \u2022 the scope, rate of progress, expense and results of clinical trials of our CD19, CD19B, CD20, and BCMA product candidates, as well as of any future clinical trials of other product candidates and other research and development activities that we may conduct; \n \u2022 the extent to which we in-license or acquire rights to other products, product candidates or technologies; \nInterest expense of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 consists of interest from the 2019 Notes at a rate of 6% per annum.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nCargill, Inc.\nOur primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, which consist primarily of research and development and general and administrative expenses. Our losses have resulted from expenses incurred in connection with our research and development activities, including our clinical programs, preclinical development activities, and general and administrative costs associated with our operations. The use of cash in operating activities during the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 resulted from our net loss adjusted for non-cash expenses and changes in working capital.\nIn April 2020, we commenced patient dosing in a Phase 1/2a clinical trial with our second allogeneic CAR T cell therapy product candidate, PBCAR20A. PBCAR20A is wholly owned by us and targets the validated tumor cell surface target CD20. It is being investigated in R/R NHL, including those with R/R chronic lymphocytic leukemia, CLL, or R/R small lymphocytic lymphoma, or SLL. A subset of the NHL patients will have the diagnosis of MCL and we have received orphan drug designation for PBCAR20A from the FDA for the treatment of this disease. Based on the safety profile observed to date with PBCAR0191, the FDA allowed us to commence dosing with PBCAR20A directly at 1 x 106 cells/kg. The study has continued to escalate through dose level two (3 x 106 cells/kg), and, in February 2021, we commenced patient dosing at dose level 3 (480 x 106 cell fixed dose) with a max dose of 6 x 106 cells/kg. We expect to report interim data for the PBCAR20A study in 2021.\nInterest income was $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease of $3.5 million of interest income generated on our cash and cash equivalent balances was the result of lower interest rates and lower cash balances in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nRoyalties - For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on a level of sales, which are the result of a customer-vendor relationship and for which the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied or partially satisfied. To date, we have not recognized any royalty revenue resulting from any of our licensing arrangements.\n \u2022 costs of outside consultants, including their fees and related travel expenses; \n\n\nIn October 2020, we entered into Amendment No. 6 to the Servier Agreement, effective as of October 2, 2020 ( Amendment No. 6\u201d). Terms of the Servier Agreement were amended, solely as applicable to PBCAR0191. Under Amendment No. 6, we are required to complete the ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trial of PBCAR0191 in adult patients with R/R NHL and R/R B-ALL (the Clinical Trial\u201d) for a specified number of patients in the Phase 1 portion of the Clinical Trial and a number of patients to be determined by us in the\nWe recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over time, and if over time this is based on the use of an output or input method.\nThere are no assurances that we will be successful in obtaining an adequate level of financing as and when needed to finance our operations on terms acceptable to us or at all, particularly in light of the economic downturn and ongoing uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic. If we are unable to secure adequate additional funding as and when needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more product candidates. In addition, the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our liquidity and future funding requirements remains uncertain as of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as the pandemic continues to evolve globally. See Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d above and Risk Factors- The ongoing novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19 has impacted our business and any other pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease may materially and adversely impact our business, including our preclinical studies and clinical trials\u201d in Part I, Item 1A. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.\nIn February 2016, we entered into the Servier Agreement, pursuant to which we have agreed to develop allogeneic CAR T cell therapies for five unique antigen targets. One target was selected at the agreement's inception. Two additional hematological cancer targets beyond CD19 and two new solid tumor targets were selected in 2020. With the addition of these new targets, we received development milestone payments in 2020 and may be eligible to receive additional development milestone payments in 2021. We may also be eligible to receive option fees, as well as clinical, regulatory and sales milestone payments in addition to royalties on product sales. Upon selection of an antigen target under the agreement, we have agreed to perform early-stage research and development on individual T cell modifications for the selected target, develop the resulting therapeutic product candidates through Phase 1 clinical trials and prepare initial clinical trial material of such product candidates for use in Phase 2 clinical trials.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nproducers in the industry. Fungicides, or other traditional means of disease control have failed as the pandemic continues to spread across vital banana growing economies. Development of Foc TR4 varieties is critically important to save the banana industry, to protect the livelihoods of millions of banana growers and continue to provide consumers an affordable and nutritious fruit. Under the terms of the collaboration, Dole will fully fund research and development efforts executed by Elo, and Elo is eligible to receive royalties on any commercialized plant product.\nPhase 2a portion of the Clinical Trial. We will be solely responsible for all costs and expenses we incur to complete the Clinical Trial, including the production and release of all required clinical trial material.\n (2) We have entered into a license agreement with an undisclosed licensee for intellectual property used in our research programs. The agreement requires us to pay annual license fees and milestones payments for achievement of specified clinical and commercial events. We have excluded these potential milestone payments in the contractual obligations table because the timing and likelihood of these contingent payments are not currently known and would be difficult to predict or estimate. \nFood Segment Collaborations\nOn December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into United States law. The TCJA includes a number of changes to existing tax law, including, among other things, a permanent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from a top marginal tax rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, effective as of January 1, 2018, as well as a limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of annual taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, in each case, for losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 (though any such net operating losses may be carried forward indefinitely). The federal tax rate change resulted in a reduction in the gross amount of our deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2017, and a corresponding reduction in our valuation allowance. As a result, no income tax expense or benefit was recognized as of the enactment date of the TCJA.\nOur revenues are generated primarily through collaborative research, license, development and commercialization agreements. The terms of these agreements generally contain multiple elements, or deliverables, which may include (1) licenses, or options to obtain licenses, to use our technology, (2) research and development activities to be performed on behalf of the collaborative partner, and (3) in certain cases, services in connection with the manufacturing of preclinical and clinical material. Payments we receive under these arrangements typically include one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; option exercise fees; funding of research and/or development efforts; clinical and development, regulatory, and sales milestone payments; and royalties on future product sales. We classify payments received under these agreements as revenues within our consolidated statements of operations.\nUnder the guidance of ASC 606, certain judgments affect revenue recognition. Our primary performance obligations under our agreements consist of research and development services. Measuring the amount of time it takes for us to complete these services includes estimating our total effort to satisfy our performance obligations at the outset of the agreement and then comparing that amount to the actual effort expended for a given accounting period. In certain instances, significant judgment is required to estimate the timing of satisfying these obligations and timing may change due to efforts beyond our control, such as changes in the customer's direction of a particular research program or changes to the contractual terms of an agreement. Accordingly, our estimates may change in the future. Such changes to estimates will result in a change in prospective revenue recognition amounts.\nInterest Income\nAs a result of these anticipated expenditures, we will need additional financing to support our continuing operations. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public equity, debt financings or other sources, which may include current and new collaborations with third parties. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our inability to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. We cannot assure you that we will ever generate significant revenue to achieve profitability.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nupfront cash proceeds from strategic partnerships on terms and conditions reasonably satisfactory to PWB, the maturity date shall then instead be June 23, 2023. Under the terms of Amendment No. 3, the interest rate increased to a variable annual rate equal to the greater of (a) 2.75% above the Prime Rate (as defined in the Original Agreement), and (b) 6.00%. The Company must also maintain an aggregate balance of unrestricted cash at PWB (not including amounts in certain specified accounts) equal to or greater than $10.0 million.\nIn October 2020, we announced the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's PTAB issued judgements in our favor in two patent interference proceedings that challenged nine U.S. patents we owned. The patents, which issued in 2018, relate to allogeneic CAR T cells produced by inserting a gene encoding a CAR into the TRAC locus, as well as methods of using those cells for cancer immunotherapy. In the interference proceedings, a third party argued that it had invented the technology in 2012. The PTAB, however, found that the third-party patent application did not satisfy the written description requirement and rejected these claims while maintaining the claims in all nine of our patents.\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase substantially for the foreseeable future and will comprise a larger percentage of our total expenses as we continue our Phase 1/2a clinical trials for our CD19, CD20 and BCMA product candidates, commence our Phase 1 clinical trial of CD19B, and continue to discover and develop additional product candidates.\nTherapeutics Segment\nWe analyze our collaboration arrangements to assess whether they are within the scope of ASU No. 2018-18 Collaborative Arrangements, or ASC 808, to determine whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities. This assessment is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in the responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement. For collaboration arrangements within the scope of ASC 808 that contain multiple elements, we first determine which elements of the collaboration are deemed to be within the scope of ASC 808 and those that are more reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and, therefore, are within the scope of ASC 606. For elements of collaboration arrangements that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 808, an appropriate recognition method is determined and applied consistently, generally by analogy to ASC 606. For those elements of the arrangement that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 606, we apply the five-step model described above.\nSpringWorks Therapeutics\nWe are working closely with our clinical sites, physician partners and the patient community to monitor and manage the impact of the evolving COVID-19 pandemic. We remain committed to our clinical programs and development plans, however, disruptions, competing resource demands and safety concerns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have caused, and are likely to continue to cause delays in our clinical trial site activation and impact our ability to enroll patients. We may also experience other difficulties, disruptions or delays in conducting preclinical studies or initiating, enrolling, conducting or completing our planned and ongoing clinical trials, and we may incur other unforeseen costs as a result. We expect that the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact our business, including our preclinical studies and clinical trials. At this time, there is still significant uncertainty relating to the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic and impact of related responses. The impact of COVID-19 on our preclinical studies and any further impact to our clinical trials will largely depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate geographic spread of the disease, the duration of the pandemic, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on financial markets and the global economy, and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease. The Coronavirus, Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act ( CARES Act\u201d) was signed into law on March 27, 2020, which provides for, among other things, the deferral of the deposit and payment of certain taxes. Pursuant to the CARES Act, the Company elected to defer payment of the employer's share of social security taxes incurred between May 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020. See Risk Factors- The outbreak of the ongoing novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19 has impacted our business, or and\nAs of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there have been no borrowings under our Revolving Line, and we are in compliance with the financial covenants under the Pacific Western Loan Agreement.\nany combination of common and preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units of up to $200.0 million in the aggregate. As of December 31, 2020, we have not sold any securities under our shelf registration statement.\n \u2022 CMOs and other vendors in connection with product manufacturing and development and distribution of preclinical supplies. \nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1.3 million, compared to $173.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The higher cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, was due to proceeds received from our IPO, which closed in April 2019, and proceeds from the 2019 Notes, which were issued in March 2019. Financing activities in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 related to cash proceeds received from stock option exercise and our employee stock purchase plan.\n \u2022 significant and changing government regulation and regulatory guidance; \nA description of recent accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows is disclosed in Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \u2022 facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs if specifically identifiable to research activities. \nResearch and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $98.1 million, compared to $82.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $15.7 million was primarily due to a $16.2 million increase in platform development and early-stage research expenses, a $3.9 million increase in direct research and development expenses related to our CD19 program, partially offset by decreases of $2.7 and $1.8 in direct research and development expenses related to our CD20 and BCMA programs, respectively.\nIn September 2020, we regained full clinical development and commercialization rights, and all data we generated for the in vivo chronic HBV program developed under our 2018 collaboration agreement with Gilead Sciences. We are exploring partnership or alternative opportunities to enable the continued development of ARCUS-based HBV therapies.\nImpact of COVID-19 Pandemic\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019\nIn January 2021, we and Lilly closed the Development and License Agreement following clearance under the Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the HSR Act\u201d). In connection with the closing, we received an upfront cash payment of $100.0 million as well as $35.0 million from Lilly's purchase of 3,762,190 newly issued shares of our common stock pursuant to a stock purchase agreement as described below (the Stock Purchase Agreement\u201d). We will also be eligible to receive milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $420 million per licensed product as well as nomination fees for additional targets and certain research funding. If licensed products resulting from the collaboration are approved and sold, we will also be entitled to receive tiered royalties ranging from the mid-single digit percentages to the low-teens percentages on world-wide net sales of the licensed products, subject to customary potential reductions. Lilly's obligation to pay royalties to us expires on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis, upon the latest to occur of certain events related to expiration of patents, regulatory exclusivity or a period of ten years following first commercial sale of the licensed product.\nSince our formation in 2006, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing ARCUS, conducting research and development activities, recruiting skilled personnel, developing manufacturing processes, establishing our intellectual property portfolio and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from upfront payments from collaboration and licensing agreements, our IPO, and private placements of convertible preferred stock and convertible debt.\n\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated costs incurred for the services when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to the following:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nMilestone Payments - If an arrangement includes development and regulatory milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee's control, such as regulatory approvals, are generally not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nEli Lilly and Company\nWe cannot determine with certainty the duration and costs of ongoing and future clinical trials of our CD19, CD19B, CD20, and BCMA product candidates, or any other product candidate we may develop or if, when or to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. We may never succeed in obtaining marketing approval for any product candidate. The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our CD19, CD19B, CD20, and BCMA product candidates, and any other our product candidate we may develop will depend on a variety of factors, including:\nWe base our expenses related to preclinical studies on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with CROs that conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials and CMOs that manufacture product for our\nIn May 2019, we entered into the Pacific Western Loan Agreement with PWB as amended by the First Amendment to Loan and Security Amendment, effective September 18, 2019, the Second Amendment to Loan and Security Amendment, effective December 3, 2019 (the Original Agreement\u201d). On June 23, 2020, the Company and PWB entered into the Third Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement (the Amendment No. 3\u201d) to the Original Agreement (as amended, the Pacific Western Loan Agreement\u201d). The terms of Amendment No. 3 (a) decrease the aggregate principal amount of advances on a revolving line of credit (the Revolving Line\u201d) from $50.0 million to $30.0 million and (b) extend the maturity date of the Revolving Line to June 23, 2022, provided that, if the Company receives aggregate cash proceeds of at least $125.0 million from the issuance of the Company's equity securities and/or\nSegment Results\nCash used in investing activities primarily relates to leasehold additions, equipment and software. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $5.0 million, compared to $24.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to the completion of the build-out of our MCAT facility in Research Triangle Park and other leased facilities in 2019.\nServier\nPlatform development and early-stage research expenses increased primarily due to a $10.9 million increase in employee-related expense associated with increased headcount to support our technology platform development and manufacturing capabilities, a $6.0 million increase in CMO and research organization expense, primarily related to our planned CD19B clinical trial, a $3.3 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense driven by our higher depreciable asset base during the year ended December 31, 2020, and a $0.3 million increase in facility-related expenses, partially offset by a $4.9 million decrease in outsourced research and development expense in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\n \u2022 the expense of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights. \nIn January 2018, we entered into a research, collaboration and license agreement with the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania ( Penn\u201d) to collaborate on the preclinical development for gene editing products involving the delivery of an ARCUS nuclease. On April 29, 2020, both parties agreed to coordinate a wind-down of all activities in their entirety under the agreement, effective as of June 30, 2020, however, in August 2020 and subsequently in January 2021, both parties agreed to extend certain portions of the agreement until 2022. We will not be required to make termination payments to Penn.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nDole Food Company\nRevenue\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our discovery efforts and the development of our product candidates. These include the following:\nSignificant Financing Component - In determining the transaction price, we adjust consideration for the effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments provides us with a significant benefit of financing. We do not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the expectation at contract inception is such that the period between payment by the licensees and the transfer of the promised goods or services to the licensees will be one year or less. We assessed each of our revenue arrangements in order to determine whether a significant financing component exists and concluded that a significant financing component does not exist in any of our arrangements.\nWe currently conduct our operations through two reportable segments: Therapeutics and Food. Our Therapeutics segment is focused on allogeneic CAR T immunotherapy and in vivo gene correction. Our Food segment focuses on applying ARCUS to develop food and nutrition products through collaboration agreements with consumer-facing companies.\n \u2022 the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against any intellectual property-related claims; and \nThe following is a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2020:\nRevenue Recognition\nresearch and development activities on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or amount of prepaid expense accordingly.\nChange in Fair Value of Convertible Notes Payable\nWe do not currently have any approved products and have never generated any revenue from product sales. Through the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from our IPO, private placements of our convertible preferred stock, convertible debt and common stock, and upfront payments from collaboration and licensing arrangements. As of December 31, 2020, we had raised approximately $492.5 million of proceeds from third parties through a combination of financings including our IPO, preferred stock and convertible note financings, payments under the Servier Agreement, and funding from other strategic alliances and grants. We also currently have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-238857) filed with the SEC on June 1, 2020 (the Form S-3\u201d) under which we may offer from time to time in one or more offerings\nWe will remain an emerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more, (2) December 31, 2024, (3) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years or (4) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC, which means the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, we have been a public company for at least 12 months and have filed one Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Pacific Western Loan Agreement matures on June 23, 2023, as a result of the events discussed in Note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the periods presented:\nInterest Income\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including share-based compensation, for personnel in our executive, finance, business development, operations and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters; professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services; insurance costs; travel expenses; and facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs that are not specifically attributable to research activities.\nAdditionally, in June 2020, Elo, our wholly-owned subsidiary, established a strategic partnership with the Dole and entered into a Research, Development, and Commercialization Agreement with Dole, with the aim to co-develop banana varieties resistant to Foc TR4, utilizing proprietary computational biology workflows and the ARCUS genome editing platform. The disease caused by Foc TR4, commonly known as Fusarium wilt, threatens the continued cultivation of the world's most popular variety of banana called Cavendish, which is of considerable economic significance as this variety is used to produce export bananas for key markets around the globe and Dole is one of the largest producers in the industry. Fungicides, or other traditional means of disease control have failed as the pandemic continues to spread across vital banana growing economies.\nIn November 2020, we announced a research collaboration and exclusive license agreement with Lilly to utilize ARCUS for the research and development of potential in vivo therapies for genetic disorders, with an initial focus on DMD and two other undisclosed gene targets. Under the agreement, Lilly has the right to nominate up to three additional gene targets for genetic disorders over the first four years of the Development and License Agreement, which may be extended to six years upon Lilly's election and payment of an extension fee.\nIn February 2016, we entered into the Servier Agreement for the licensing of our ARCUS proprietary genome editing platform and the research, development, and manufacturing of product for clinical trials and commercialization of products. In September 2018, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Gilead, which we refer to as the Gilead Agreement, to develop genome editing tools using our ARCUS proprietary genome editing platform. Both agreements use our genome editing technology for the treatment of certain diseases. Consideration we received, or may receive, under these collaboration and license agreements include upfront nonrefundable payments, research funding payments and payments based upon the achievement of certain milestones and royalties on any resulting net product sales.\nTrustees of the University of Pennsylvania\nGilead\nTherapeutics Segment Collaborations\nUnder the Servier Agreement, we recognized $18.0 million and $7.3 million in revenue during the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The amount recorded as deferred revenue was $82.9 million and $80.9 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\n \u2022 uncertainties in clinical trial design and patient enrollment rates; \nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or if we experience significant delays in our clinical trials due to slower than expected patient enrollment or other reasons, we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.\nWe are a life sciences company dedicated to improving life through the application of our pioneering, proprietary ARCUS genome editing platform. We leverage ARCUS in the development of our product candidates, which are designed to treat human diseases and create healthy and sustainable food and agricultural solutions. We are actively developing product candidates in three innovative areas: allogeneic CAR T cell immunotherapy, in vivo gene correction, and food. We are currently conducting a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of PBCAR0191 in adult patients with relapsed or refractory, or R/R, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or NHL, or R/R B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or B-ALL. PBCAR0191 is our first gene-edited allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, T cell therapy candidate targeting CD19 and is being developed in collaboration with Servier pursuant to the Servier Agreement. We have received orphan drug designation for PBCAR0191 from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA\u201d), for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL. In August 2020, the FDA granted Fast Track Designation for PBCAR0191 for the treatment of B-ALL. The NHL cohort will include patients with mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL\u201d), an aggressive subtype of NHL, for which we have received orphan drug designation from the FDA. Made from donor-derived T cells modified using our ARCUS genome editing technology, PBCAR0191 recognizes the well characterized tumor cell surface protein CD19, an important and validated target in several B-cell cancers, and is designed to avoid graft-versus-host disease, or GvHD, a significant complication associated with donor-derived, cell-based therapies. We believe that this trial, which is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of PBCAR0191 at increasing dose levels, as well as to evaluate anti-tumor activity, is the first U.S.-based clinical trial to evaluate an allogeneic CAR T therapy for R/R NHL. Furthermore, we believe that our proprietary, one-step engineering process for producing allogeneic CAR T cells with a potentially optimized cell phenotype, at large scale in a cost-effective manner, will enable us to overcome the fundamental clinical and manufacturing challenges that have limited the CAR T field to date. We expect to report updated interim data for the PBCAR0191 study in mid-year 2021.\nIn December 2020, we announced interim clinical results from our Phase 1/2a study of PBCAR0191 as a treatment of R/R NHL and R/R B-ALL. As of the November 16, 2020 cutoff, 27 patients including 16 patients with aggressive NHL and 11 patients with aggressive B-ALL were enrolled and evaluated. In this dose escalation and dose expansion study, PBCAR0191 had an acceptable safety profile with no cases of graft versus host disease, no cases of Grade \u2265 3 cytokine release syndrome, and no cases of Grade \u2265 3 neurotoxicity. PBCAR0191 demonstrated longest durability of response to 11 months in B-ALL. PBCAR0191 with eLD resulted in objective response rate of 83% (5/6) in NHL and B-ALL as compared to 33% (3/9) in NHL with sLD.\n\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020, cash payments received from Lilly in January 2021 in connection with the closing of the Development and License Agreement, expected operational receipts and available credit will allow us to continue its operations into 2023. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be imprecise, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical and agricultural products, it is difficult to estimate with certainty the amount of our working capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\nInterest expense consists of interest from the 2019 Notes at a rate of 6% per annum.\nWe expect to advance a program targeting the rare genetic disease PH1 as our lead wholly owned in vivo gene correction program. PH1 affects approximately 1-3 people per million in the United States and is caused by loss of function mutations in the AGXT gene, leading to the accumulation of calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys. Patients suffer from painful kidney stones which may ultimately lead to renal failure. Using ARCUS, we are developing a potential therapeutic approach to PH1 that involves knocking out a gene called HAO1 which acts upstream of AGXT. Suppressing HAO1 has been shown in preclinical models by us to prevent the formation of calcium oxalate. We therefore believe that a one-time administration of an ARCUS nuclease targeting HAO1 may be a viable strategy for a durable treatment of PH1 patients. Pre-clinical research has continued to progress, and we expect to provide an update on this program in the first half of 2021.\n \u2022 the actual probability of success for our product candidates, including their safety and efficacy, early clinical data, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability; \nIn June 2020, we commenced patient dosing in a Phase 1/2a clinical trial with our third allogenic CAR T cell therapy product candidate, PBCAR269A. The starting dose of PBCAR269A is 6 x 105 cells/kg. PBCAR269A is wholly owned by us and is designed to target the validated tumor cell surface target BCMA. It is being investigated in subjects with R/R multiple myeloma and we have received orphan drug designation and Fast Track Designation from the FDA for this indication. In September 2020, we announced that we entered into a clinical trial collaboration with SpringWorks, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing medicines for patients with severe rare diseases and cancer. Pursuant to the collaboration, PBCAR269A will be evaluated in combination with nirogacestat, SpringWorks' investigational GSI, in patients with R/R multiple myeloma, which is expected to commence in the first half of 2021. In February 2021, we commenced patient dosing at the highest dose cohort, dose level 3 of 6 x 106 cells/kg and we expect to report interim data on the PBCAR269A trial in 2021.\nWe elected on issuance to account for the 2019 Notes at fair value until their settlement. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized $9.8 million of expense as changes in fair value. The 2019 Notes were settled on the closing of the IPO in April 2019.\nThe results of the Clinical Trial will be used to determine whether specified development milestones have been achieved with respect to PBCAR0191, in which case, specified corresponding development milestone payments are payable by Servier to us. The results of the Clinical Trial will also be used to determine whether Phase 2 readiness has been achieved for PBCAR0191 and Servier may determine whether, subject to payment of a commercial option exercise fee, to exercise its commercial option and proceed with development and commercialization of PBCAR0191. Following completion of the Clinical Trial, we are not obligated to conduct any further development activities under the Servier Agreement with respect to PBCAR0191 unless we otherwise agree to conduct such further development activities.\nIn November 2020, we entered into a research collaboration and exclusive license agreement (the Development and License Agreement\u201d) with Lilly to utilize ARCUS for the research and development of potential in vivo therapies for genetic disorders. Lilly has initially nominated DMD and two gene targets for other genetic disorders, and has the right to nominate up to three additional gene targets for genetic disorders over the first four years of the Development and License Agreement (the Nomination Period\u201d). Lilly may extend the Nomination Period for an additional two years from the date on which such initial Nomination Period ends, upon Lilly's election and payment of an extension fee. Under the terms of the Development and License Agreement, Lilly will receive an exclusive license to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize the resulting licensed products to diagnose, prevent and treat any and all diseases by in vivo gene editing directed against the applicable gene target. The Development and License Agreement provides that we will be responsible for conducting certain pre-clinical research and IND-enabling activities with respect to the gene targets nominated by Lilly to be subject to the collaboration, including manufacture of initial clinical trial material for the first licensed product. Lilly will be responsible for, and must use commercially reasonable efforts with respect to, conducting clinical development and commercialization activities for licensed products resulting from the collaboration, and may engage us for additional clinical and/or initial commercial manufacture of licensed products.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many important factors, including those set forth in Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements.

The increase of $1.3 million was the result of a $10.7 increase in collaboration revenue recognized from Servier, partially offset by a $9.5 million decrease in revenue recognized from Gilead due to the termination of the Gilead Agreement. Segment operational cash expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $71.8 million, compared to $70.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $1.7 million in operational cash expenditures was primarily due to an increase in employee costs and payments made to service providers for contract manufacturing and clinical trial research, partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures for fixed assets and a reduction in payments to external vendors for early-stage research. Segment operating loss increased $0.6 million from $49.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $50.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the factors discussed above.\nOn April 1, 2019, we completed our IPO of 9,085,000 shares of common stock, including the underwriters' full exercise of their option to purchase an additional 1,185,000 additional shares of common stock, at an offering price of $16.00 per share, for net proceeds of approximately $130.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us. As of December 31, 2020, we have generated approximately $492.5 million from third parties to date.\nOur cash and cash equivalents totaled $89.8 million as of December 31, 2020, compared to $180.9 million as of December 31, 2019.\nCash Flows\nShare-Based Compensation\n \u2022 increased costs of additional clinical sites to address slowed enrollment due to the impact of COVID-19; \nInterest Expense\nWe expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we continue research activities and development of product candidates.\nWe have the right to elect to co-fund the clinical development of one licensed product, which may be selected from among the third or any subsequent licensed products to reach IND filing. If we elect to co-fund such licensed product, we would reimburse Lilly for a portion of the clinical development expenses for such product and, in exchange, each royalty tier with respect to net sales of such licensed product would be increased by a low single digit percentage. During the term of the Development and License Agreement, we may not (and may not license or collaborate with any third party to) research, develop, or commercialize any in vivo gene editing product directed against any gene targets that have been nominated and are subject to the Development and License Agreement.\nOn July 6, 2020, Gilead Sciences ( Gilead\u201d) notified us of its termination of the collaboration and license agreement dated September 10, 2018, subsequently amended by Amendment No. 1 dated March 10, 2020 or (the Gilead Agreement\u201d), to develop genome editing tools using ARCUS to target viral DNA associated with the hepatitis B virus. Pursuant to the termination notice, the Gilead Agreement terminated on September 4, 2020. Upon termination, we regained full rights and all data we generated for the in vivo chronic hepatitis B program developed under the Gilead Agreement.\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC rules.\nCash Provided by Financing Activities\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. We track external research and development costs, including the costs of laboratory supplies and services, outsourced research and development, clinical trials, contract manufacturing, laboratory equipment and maintenance and certain other development costs, by product candidate when the program IND application is accepted by the FDA. Internal and external costs associated with infrastructure resources, other research and development costs, facility related costs and depreciation and amortization that are not identifiable to a specific product candidate are included in the platform development and early-stage research expenses category in the table below.\nIncome Taxes\nChange in Fair Value of Convertible Notes Payable\n
