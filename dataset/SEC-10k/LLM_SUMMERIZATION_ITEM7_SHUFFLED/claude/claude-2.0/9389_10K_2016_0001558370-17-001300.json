Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which include additional information about our accounting policies, practices and the transactions underlying our financial results. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes, environmental and other matters arising during the normal course of business. We apply our best judgment, our knowledge of existing facts and circumstances and actions that we may undertake in the future in determining the estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results may differ from these estimates. Ball Corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as Ball Corporation,\u201d Ball,\u201d the company,\u201d we\u201d or our\u201d in the following discussion and analysis.\nOVERVIEW\nBusiness Overview and Industry Trends\nBall Corporation is one of the world's leading suppliers of metal packaging to the beverage, food, personal care and household products industries. Our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses, are manufactured in facilities around the world and are competitive with other substrates, such as plastics and glass. In the rigid packaging industry, sales and earnings can be increased by reducing costs, increasing prices, developing new products, expanding volumes and making strategic acquisitions. We also provide aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers.\nWe sell our packaging products mainly to large, multinational beverage, food, personal care and household products companies with which we have developed long-term relationships. This is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of long-term supply contracts. While we have a diversified customer base, we sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major companies in North, Central and South America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa, as do our equity joint ventures in Guatemala, Panama, South Korea, the U.S. and Vietnam. The overall metal container industry is growing globally and is expected to continue to grow in the medium to long term despite the North American industry seeing a continued decline in standard-sized aluminum beverage packaging for the carbonated soft drink market. The primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace segment are U.S. government agencies or their prime contractors.\nWe purchase our raw materials from relatively few suppliers. We also have exposure to inflation, in particular the rising costs of raw materials, as well as other direct cost inputs. We mitigate our exposure to the changes in the costs of metal through the inclusion of provisions in contracts covering the majority of our volumes to pass through metal price changes, as well as through the use of derivative instruments. The pass-through provisions generally result in proportional increases or decreases in sales and costs with a greatly reduced impact, if any, on net earnings. Because of our customer and supplier concentration, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss, insolvency or bankruptcy of a major customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a major customer or supplier, although our contract provisions generally mitigate the risk of customer loss, and our long-term relationships represent a known, stable customer base.\nWe recognize sales under long-term contracts in the aerospace segment using percentage-of-completion under the cost-to-cost method of accounting. Throughout the period of contract performance, we regularly reevaluate and, if necessary, revise our estimates of aerospace total contract revenue, total contract cost and progress toward completion. Because of contract payment schedules, limitations on funding and other contract terms, our sales and accounts receivable for this segment include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed.\nCorporate Strategy\nOur Drive for 10 vision encompasses five strategic levers that are key to growing our business and achieving long-term success. Since launching Drive for 10 in 2011, we made progress on each of the levers as follows:\nTable 53: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMaximizing value in our existing businesses by rationalizing standard beverage container and end capacity in North America and expanding specialty container production to meet current demand; leveraging plant floor systems in our beverage facilities to improve efficiencies and reduce costs; consolidating and/or closing multiple beverage and food and aerosol packaging facilities to gain efficiencies; and in food and aerosol packaging segment, installing new extruded aluminum aerosol lines in our existing Devizes, U.K., and Czech Republic facilities while also implementing cost-out and value-in initiatives across all of our businesses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 54: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nExpanding further into new products and capabilities by the acquisition of Sonoco's metal end and closure manufacturing facilities in Canton, Ohio, in February 2015; successfully commercializing extruded aluminum aerosol packaging that utilizes a significant amount of recycled material; and successfully commercializing the next generation aluminum bottle-shaping technology;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 55: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAligning ourselves with the right customers and markets by investing capital to meet double-digit volume growth for specialty beverage containers throughout our global network, which represent more than 30 percent of our global beverage packaging mix; aligning with craft brewers, sparkling water fillers and wine producers who continue to use beverage containers to grow their business;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 56: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBroadening our geographic reach with our acquisition of Rexam and our new investments in a beverage manufacturing facility in Myanmar, as well as an extruded aluminum aerosol manufacturing facility in India, and the construction of a beverage container facility in Monterrey, Mexico, producing cans and ends; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 57: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLeveraging our technological expertise in packaging innovation, including the introduction of next-generation aluminum bottle-shaping technologies, the introduction of a new two-piece, lightweight steel aerosol can, G3, technology in our Chestnut Hill, Tennessee, facility and the increased production of lightweight ReAl\u2122 containers with 25 percent recycled aluminum content; and investment in cyber and data analytics to further enhance our aerospace technical expertise across a broader customer portfolio.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese ongoing business developments and the successful acquisition of Rexam completed on June 30, 2016, help us stay close to our customers while expanding and/or sustaining our industry positions with major beverage, food, personal care, household products and aerospace customers.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nConsolidated Sales and Earnings\nTable 58: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,061 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,997 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8,570 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet earnings attributable to Ball Corporation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet earnings attributable to Ball Corporation as a\n% of consolidated net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales in 2016 were $1.1 billion higher compared to 2015 primarily as a result of increased sales of $1.5 billion related to the acquired Rexam business, net of Ball's legacy sales included in the Divestment Business. This increase was partially offset by lower metal input costs passed through to customers of $299 million. Net earnings in 2016 were lower than 2015 primarily due to $142 million higher business consolidation and other activities from increased costs associated with the Rexam acquisition and the sale of the Divestment Business, $167 million of increased depreciation and amortization primarily attributable to depreciation and amortization associated with the acquired Rexam business, recognition in cost of sales of $84 million step-up of inventory related to the acquired Rexam business, higher interest expense of $78 million associated with the net increase in borrowings to fund the cash portion of the purchase price of Rexam and $62 million increased selling, general and administrative costs also due to costs from the acquired Rexam\nbusiness. These decreases were partially offset by a gain of $344 million in 2016 recognized on the sale of the Ball legacy portion of the Divestment Business, $173 million lower income tax expense in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the tax impacts of the sale of the Divestment Business, earnings from the increase in net sales from the acquired Rexam business, net of the sale of Ball's legacy portion of the Divestment Business, lower net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests and higher equity in results of affiliates.\nThe increased business consolidation and other activities in 2016 compared to 2015 included transaction costs related to the acquisition of Rexam, net currency exchange losses on the restricted cash, intercompany loans and debt associated with the Rexam acquisition and Rexam acquisition-related compensation arrangements, partially offset by the gain on sale of the Divestment Business. See Note 5 located in Item 8 of this annual report for additional information on the activity in business consolidation and other activities.\nThe decreased debt refinancing and other costs in 2016 compared to 2015 included mark-to-market losses on derivative financial instruments designed to mitigate exposure to interest rate changes for debt issuances related to the Rexam acquisition, interest expense on issued 3.5 percent and 4.375 percent senior notes used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Rexam acquisition, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing charges for the partial extinguishment of the committed bridge loan agreement, and the revolving credit facility and amortization of deferred financing costs for the committed bridge loan agreement. See Notes 14 and 20 located in Item 8 of this annual report for additional information on the activity in debt refinancing and other costs.\nThe decrease in net sales in 2015 compared to 2014 was due to unfavorable foreign currency effects in Europe, lower metal food container sales volumes due to a customer shift in North American steel food containers and unfavorable pricing in the PRC, partially offset by higher beverage packaging sales volumes. Net earnings were lower in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower sales, unfavorable currency effects, higher business consolidation and other activities and higher debt refinancing and other costs, partially offset by a lower tax rate in 2015 and cost reduction efforts by all business segments.\nThe increased business consolidation and other activities in 2015 compared to 2014 included collar and option contract losses, cross-currency swap fair value changes, net currency exchange losses on the restricted cash and debt associated with the Rexam acquisition, and transaction costs related to the acquisition of Rexam. The collar and option contracts, as well as the cross-currency swap, are not accounted for as hedges. See Notes 5 and 20 located in Item 8 of this annual report for additional information on financial instruments.\nThe increased debt refinancing and other costs in 2015 compared to 2014 included mark-to-market losses on derivative financial instruments designed to mitigate exposure to interest rates changes for debt issuances related to the Rexam acquisition, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing charges for the partial extinguishment of the committed bridge loan agreement and the revolving credit facility, interest expense on 3.5 percent and 4.375 percent senior notes issued to fund a portion of the purchase price of the Rexam acquisition, amortization of deferred financing costs for the committed bridge loan agreement and the redemption of the 6.75 percent and 5.75 percent senior notes. See Notes 14 and 20 located in Item 8 of this annual report for additional information on financial instruments.\nCost of Sales (Excluding Depreciation and Amortization)\nCost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization, was $7,296 million in 2016 compared to $6,460 million in 2015 and $6,903 million in 2014. These amounts represented 81 percent of consolidated net sales for each of these years. Cost of sales in 2016 included expense of $84 million for the step-up of inventory related to the acquired Rexam business.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $453 million in 2016 compared to $286 million in 2015 and $281 million in 2014. These amounts represented 5 percent, 4 percent and 3 percent of consolidated net sales for those three years, respectively. Depreciation expense was higher in 2016 than in 2015 primarily due to the acquired Rexam fixed assets. Amortization in 2016 included $65 million for the amortization of acquired Rexam intangibles.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $512 million in 2016 compared to $450 million in 2015 and $466 million in 2014. These amounts represented 6 percent, 6 percent and 5 percent of consolidated net sales for those three years, respectively. The increase in SG&A expenses in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to additional SG&A from the acquired Rexam business, which will be reduced in 2017 through cost-out initiatives, and foreign exchange losses of $27 million for the devaluation of the Egyptian pound in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in SG&A expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to lower incentive compensation and net favorable foreign currency effects in SG&A, partially offset by deferred compensation expense related to director retirements in 2015.\nBusiness Consolidation Costs and Other Activities\nBusiness consolidation and other activities were $337 million in 2016 compared to $195 million in 2015 and $81million in 2014. These amounts represented 4 percent, 2 percent and 1 percent of consolidated net sales for the three years, respectively.\nThe year-over-year increase in business consolidation and other activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to an increase of $202 million for transaction related costs, foreign currency exchange losses of $159 million on foreign currency-denominated restricted cash and debt and $108 million in expense for compensation arrangements, all associated with the Rexam acquisition and the sale of the Divestment Business. The increase was partially offset by a gain of $344 million in connection with the sale of the Divestment Business.\nThe year-over-year increase in business consolidation and other activities for 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to an increase of $98 million for transaction related costs, $41 million of losses associated with the change in fair value of the collar and option contracts entered into to reduce the exposure to currency exchange rate changes in connection with the British pound denominated cash portion of the Rexam acquisition, net foreign currency gains and losses of $14 million from the revaluation of foreign currency denominated restricted cash and losses of $7 million for cross-currency swaps in connection with the December 2015 issuance of the $1 billion senior notes due 2020. In 2014, the company recorded a non-cash charge of $45 million for the settlement of its pension benefit obligations, and recorded a provision against the balance of a long-term receivable of $17 million as a result of the financial difficulties of a food and aerosol packaging segment customer.\nThe valuations of currency exchange and interest rates were a primary driver for the amounts recorded in business consolidation and other activities in 2016, and we expect these impacts to be greatly diminished in the future. See Notes 4, 5 and 20 located in Item 8 of this annual report for additional information on financial instruments.\nInterest Expense\nTotal interest expense was $338 million in 2016 compared to $260 million in 2015 and $193 million in 2014. Excluding debt refinancing and other costs, interest expense in 2016 was higher compared to 2015 as the company incurred additional debt to pay a portion of the cash consideration due to Rexam's shareholders for the Rexam acquisition. Excluding debt refinancing and other costs, interest expense in 2015 was lower compared to 2014 due to lower interest rates on newly issued long-term debt and the retirement of higher interest rate long-term debt. Interest expense, excluding the effect of debt refinancing and other costs, as a percentage of average monthly borrowings was 4 percent in each of the years 2016 and 2015 and 5 percent in 2014.\nDebt refinancing and other costs were $109 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. These costs consisted of (1) interest expense of $49 million through June 30, 2016, on the 3.5 percent and 4.375 percent senior notes issued in December 2015, (2) fair value changes of $20 million on derivative instruments designed to mitigate risks of interest rate changes with debt issuances, (3) interest expense of $30 million through June 30, 2016, on Term A U.S. dollar and Term A euro dollar loans associated with the company's credit facility, and (4) amortization of deferred financing fees of $7 million for the Bridge Facility. See Notes 14 and 20 in Item 8 of this annual report for additional information on these instruments and the transactions flowing through debt refinancing and other costs.\nDebt refinancing and other costs were $117 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. These costs consisted of (1) interest expense of $5 million on senior notes issued in December 2015 to fund a portion of the cash consideration of the Rexam acquisition, (2) fair value changes of $16 million on derivative instruments designed to mitigate risks of\ninterest rate changes with anticipated debt issuances for a portion of the cash consideration payable in the acquisition of Rexam, (3) write-offs of unamortized deferred financing fees and other charges of $16 million for the partial extinguishment of the committed bridge loan agreement, the partial extinguishment of the revolving credit facility, and refinance of the senior credit facility, (4) the amortization of deferred financing fees of $23 million on the Bridge Facility, and (5) write off of unamortized deferred financing fees and premiums of $57 million for the redemption of previously issued senior notes and the refinance of senior credit facilities. See Notes 14 and 20 in Item 8 of this annual report for additional information on these instruments and the transactions flowing through debt refinancing and other costs.\nTax Provision\nThe 2016 full year effective income tax rate was negative 100.8 percent compared to 13.6 percent for 2015. The lower tax rate in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a 116.0 percentage point reduction for the tax benefit recorded with respect to tax deductible goodwill in a legal entity restructuring in Brazil that was completed in the current year. The tax rate was also reduced by 56.8 percentage points for increased benefits from foreign tax rate differences, primarily due to acquisitions, and by 49.6 percentage points for permanent tax differences on significant current year business dispositions. These amounts were partially offset by a 41.6 percentage point increase for non-deductible transaction costs related to current year acquisitions and a 36.8 percentage point increase for current year increases in valuation allowances, primarily on losses in the U.K.\nOur effective income tax rate is affected by recurring items such as income earned in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates that differ from the U.S. tax rate and by discrete items that may occur in any given year but that are not consistent from year to year. In 2016, we incurred a significant amount of nonrecurring business consolidation costs primarily in the U.S. The resulting reduction in earnings before income tax as a result of these costs increased the impact of permanent income tax items on the company's effective tax rate in 2016, as compared to 2015. We are uncertain whether the rate reduction impacts experienced in 2016 will continue in future years.\nThe effective tax rate for 2015 was 14 percent compared to 23 percent in 2014. The decrease in the rate for 2015 was primarily due to a 2.7 percentage point reduction related to the tax effect of statutory foreign exchange losses in our Brazilian operations, a 2.3 percentage point reduction related to the settlement of various uncertain tax positions, a 1.4 percentage point reduction related to the favorable settlement of a prior year IRS audit and a reduction in our rate of 3.0 percentage points due to an increase in U.S. research and development tax credits.\nResults of Business Segments\nAcquisition of Rexam\nOn June 30, 2016, Ball acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of Rexam, a United Kingdom based beverage container manufacturer, for the purchase price of \u00a32.9 billion ($3.8 billion) in cash, and 32.25 million treasury shares of Ball Corporation common stock (valued at $71.39 per share for a total share consideration of $2.3 billion). The common shares were valued using the price on the date of acquisition and were presented as a reduction of treasury stock. The cash portion of the acquisition price was paid in July 2016 using proceeds from restricted cash held in escrow and borrowings under the $1.4 billion and \u20ac1.1 billion Term A loan facilities obtained in March 2016.\nThe consummation of the acquisition was subject to, among other things, approval from Ball's shareholders, approval from Rexam's shareholders, certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, all of which were satisfied prior to closing. In order to satisfy certain regulatory requirements, the company was required to sell some of its existing beverage packaging businesses and select beverage can assets of Rexam (the Divestment Business).\nSegment Results\nDuring the third quarter of 2016, Ball made certain segment realignments as a result of the Rexam acquisition and sale of the Divestment Business to align with how Ball now manages its businesses. Ball has retrospectively adjusted prior period amounts to conform to the current segment presentation. Ball's operations are organized and reviewed by management along its product lines and geographical areas and presented in the five reportable segments discussed below.\nBeverage Packaging, North and Central America\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,612 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,202 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,187 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nComparable operating earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBusiness consolidation and other activities (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(20) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(19) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(11) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmortization of acquired Rexam intangibles\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(11) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCost of sales associated with Rexam inventory step-up\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(10) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal segment earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nComparable operating earnings as a % of segment net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)Further details of these items are included in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report.\nThe beverage packaging, North and Central America, segment consists of operations located in the U.S., Canada and Mexico that manufacture aluminum containers used in beverage packaging. During 2016, our beverage manufacturing facility in Monterrey, Mexico, began production. Also, in 2016, our beverage packaging end-making facility in Bristol, Virginia, ceased production.\nSegment sales in 2016 were $410 million higher compared to 2015. The increase in 2016 was primarily due to the increase in sales volumes of $526 million from the acquired Rexam business partially offset by lower metal input prices of $176 million. We cannot predict future changes in metal input prices and beverage can sales volumes.\nComparable operating earnings in 2016 were $67 million higher compared to 2015 primarily due to the earnings from the acquired Rexam business. Improved product mix from the legacy Ball business also contributed to the favorable year-over-year operating earnings improvement.\nSegment sales in 2015 were higher than in 2014 due to favorable price mix variance of $50 million, partially offset by lower sales volume of $35 million.

During the first quarter of 2016, we announced the closure of our food and aerosol packaging flat sheet production and end-making facility in Weirton, West Virginia, which is expected to cease production in early 2017. In October 2016, we sold our specialty tin manufacturing facility in Baltimore, Maryland.\nSegment sales in 2016 were $126 million lower compared to 2015 as a result of $57 million in lower prices resulting from lower metal costs passed through to customers and $69 million in volume primarily driven by lower food can sales volumes. Comparable operating earnings in 2016 were relatively unchanged compared to 2015 due to improved extruded aluminum sales which offset the decline in food can sales volumes.\nSegment sales in 2015 were $207 million lower compared to 2014 due primarily to lower metal food container sales volumes of $260 million, mainly related to a customer shift effective January 2015, and unfavorable currency exchange effects of $37 million, partially offset by favorable product mix of $90 million. The customer shift was the result of the loss of a significant customer upon expiration of their contract in December 2014. The volume reductions were offset by favorable product mix from a higher proportion of aerosol product sales, which is expected to continue. Comparable operating earnings in 2015 decreased $46 million compared to 2014 due primarily to earnings impacts from lower sales volumes, unfavorable currency exchange effects, unfavorable startup costs, partially offset by extruded aluminum aerosol growth in Europe, the earnings from the Sonoco acquisition and reduced selling, general and administrative costs.\nAerospace\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nComparable operating earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBusiness consolidation and other activities (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(14) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal segment earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nComparable operating earnings as a % of segment net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)Further details of these items are included in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report.\nThe aerospace segment consists of the manufacture and sale of aerospace and other related products and services provided for the defense, civil space and commercial space industries.\nSegment sales in 2016 were relatively unchanged compared to 2015. Comparable operating earnings in 2016 increased $6 million compared to 2015 due to individually immaterial items.\nSegment sales in 2015 decreased $125 million compared to 2014 primarily due to lower sales from U.S. national defense contracts. Comparable operating earnings in 2015 decreased $12 million compared to 2014 due to lower sales, favorable program performance in 2014 from program and contract completions and increased recovery of pension costs in 2014.\nSales to the U.S. government, either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as a subcontractor, represented 97 percent of segment sales in 2016 compared to 96 percent of segment sales in 2015 and 95 percent in 2014. The aerospace contract mix in 2016 consisted of 55 percent cost-type contracts, which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon and/or earned profit component, and 39 percent fixed-price contracts. The remaining sales were for time and materials contracts.\nContracted backlog for the aerospace segment at December 31, 2016 and 2015, was $1.4 billion and $617 million, respectively. The year-over-year increase reflects several major contract awards during 2016. The segment has numerous outstanding bids for future contract awards. The backlog at December 31, 2016, consisted of 69 percent cost-type contracts. Comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations due to the nature of varying delivery and milestone schedules on contracts, funding of programs and the uncertainty of timing of future contract awards.\nAdditional Segment Information\nFor additional information regarding our segments, see the business segment information in Note 3 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report. The charges recorded for business consolidation and other activities were based on estimates by Ball management and were developed from information available at the time. If actual outcomes vary from the estimates, the differences will be reflected in current period earnings in the consolidated statement of earnings and identified as business consolidation gains and losses. Additional details about our business consolidation and other activities are provided in Note 5 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report.\nManagement Performance Measures\nManagement internally uses various measures to evaluate company performance such as return on average invested capital (net operating earnings after tax over the relevant performance period divided by average invested capital over the same period); economic value added (EVA\u00ae) dollars (net operating earnings after tax less a capital charge on average invested capital employed); earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT); earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA); and diluted earnings per share. Management also uses free cash flow (generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures) as a measure to evaluate the company's liquidity. Please refer to the Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources section below for additional information on the company's use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure. We believe this information is also useful to investors as it provides insight into the earnings and cash flow criteria management uses to make strategic decisions. These financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods such as business consolidation costs and gains or losses on acquisitions and dispositions.\nNonfinancial measures in the packaging businesses include production efficiency and spoilage rates; quality control figures; environmental, health and safety statistics; production and sales volumes; asset utilization rates; and measures of sustainability. Additional measures used to evaluate financial performance in the aerospace segment include contract revenue realization, award and incentive fees realized, proposal win rates and backlog (including awarded, contracted and funded backlog).\nThe following financial measurements are on a non-U.S. GAAP basis and should be considered in connection with the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report. Notes 1 and 21 to the company's financial statements included in Item 8 disclose revisions to the company's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the second and third quarters of 2016. The revisions had no impact on the company's non-GAAP measures of comparable operating earnings or comparable net earnings in the second or third quarters of 2016 or for the full year ended December 31, 2016. Non-U.S. GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to, or a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. A presentation of earnings in accordance with U.S. GAAP is available in Item 8 of this annual report.\nBased on the above definitions, our calculation of comparable operating earnings is summarized

PRONOUNCEMENTS\nFor information regarding the company's critical and significant accounting policies, as well as recent accounting pronouncements, see Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report.\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nThe company announced on March 2, 2017, that it intends to cease production at its Recklinghausen, Germany, facility only after due negotiation and agreement with the Works Council.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCash Flows and Capital Expenditures\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and external committed borrowings. We believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by short-term, long-term and committed revolver borrowings, when necessary, will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditures. The following summarizes our cash flows:\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash flows provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,007 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,012 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash flows provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,721) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(391) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash flows provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(387) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,737 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(846) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash flows from operations in 2016 were lower compared to 2015 due to increased operating cash outflows in 2016 due to payments of professional fees and employee costs related to the acquisition of Rexam and sale of the Divestment Business of approximately $325 million; $297 million of additional pension funding, including $171 million related to the acquired Rexam U.K. defined benefit plan; approximately $150 million less cash inflows from working capital due to the sale of the company's legacy European business at its peak working capital requirements; $90 million of payments to settle derivatives associated with the acquired Rexam business; and $50 million of additional interest payments associated with the financing of the Rexam acquisition. Inventory days on hand increased from 49 days to 68 days, days sales outstanding increased from 35 days to 46 days and days payable outstanding increased from 82 days to 97 days. The increase in days outstanding is primarily attributable to the working capital positions of the acquired Rexam operations as compared to the legacy Ball operations included in the Divestment Business.\nCash flows from operations in 2015 were comparable to 2014 as lower pension contributions were offset by lower net earnings, lower cash inflows from working capital and cash paid for transaction costs for the acquisition of Rexam. The working capital changes were primarily related to slightly higher days sales outstanding, partially offset by lower inventory volumes and higher days payable outstanding. Days sales outstanding increased from 34 days to 35 days, inventory days on hand decreased from 52 days to 49 days and days payable outstanding increased from 69 days to 82 days. The increase in days payables outstanding is primarily due to renegotiation of payment terms in supplier contracts in North America.\nWe have entered into several regional committed and uncommitted accounts receivable factoring programs with various financial institutions for certain accounts receivables of the company. Programs accounted for as true sales of the receivables, without recourse to Ball, had combined limits of approximately $970 million at December 31, 2016. A total of $596 million and $479 million were sold under these programs at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Additionally, the company has programs that were not accounted for as true sales of the receivables, with combined limits of $30 million, under which $17 million was sold at December 31, 2016.\nAnnual cash dividends paid on common stock were 52 cents per share in each of 2016, 2015 and 2014. Total dividends paid were $83 million in 2016, $72 million in 2015 and $73 million in 2014. We paid dividends to noncontrolling interests of $18 million in 2015 and $12 million in 2014. No dividends were paid to noncontrolling interests in 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2016, approximately $597 million of our cash was held outside of the U.S. In the event that we would need to utilize any of the cash held outside of the U.S. for purposes within the U.S., there are no material legal or other economic restrictions regarding the repatriation of cash from any of the countries outside the U.S. where we have cash, other than market liquidity constraints that limit the ability to convert Egyptian pounds held by the Company in Egypt with a U.S. dollar equivalent value of $86 million into other currencies. The company believes its U.S. operating cash flows; the $1.2 billion available under the company's long-term, revolving credit facilities; the $821 million available under other U.S.-based uncommitted short-term credit facilities; and availability under U.S.-based committed and uncommitted accounts receivable factoring programs will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of the U.S. portion of the company's ongoing operations, scheduled principal and interest payments on U.S. debt, dividend payments, capital expenditures and other U.S. cash requirements. If foreign funds would be needed for our U.S. cash requirements and we are unable to provide the funds through intercompany financing arrangements, we will be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes, net of applicable foreign tax credits, to repatriate funds from foreign locations where the company has previously asserted indefinite reinvestment of funds outside the U.S. However, it continues to be the company's intent to permanently reinvest these foreign amounts outside the U.S., and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the foreign amounts to fund our U.S. cash requirements.\nDue to the U.S. tax status of certain of Ball's subsidiaries in Canada and the PRC, the company annually provides U.S. taxes on foreign earnings in those subsidiaries, net of any estimated foreign tax credits. Current taxes are also provided on certain other undistributed earnings that are currently taxed in the U.S. Net U.S. taxes provided for Brazil, Canada and PRC earnings in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $21 million, $2 million and $12 million, respectively. Management's intention is to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of Ball's remaining foreign investments and, as a result, no U.S. income or federal withholding tax provision has been made. The indefinite reinvestment assertion is supported by both long-term and short-term forecasts and U.S. financial requirements, including, but not limited to, operating cash flows, capital expenditures, debt maturities and dividends. The company has not provided deferred taxes on earnings in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in its international operations. Retained earnings in non-U.S. subsidiaries were $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2016. It is not practical to estimate the additional taxes that may become payable for the portion of these foreign earnings that have not already been taxed in the U.S.; however, repatriation of these earnings could result in a material increase in the company's income tax liabilities.\nShare Repurchases\nThe company's share repurchases, net of issuances, totaled $59 million in 2016, $100 million in 2015 and $360 million in 2014. The repurchases were completed using cash on hand and available borrowings and included accelerated share repurchase agreements and other purchases under our ongoing share repurchase program. Additional details about our share repurchase activities are provided in Note 17 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report.\nDebt Facilities and Refinancing\nGiven our cash flow projections and unused credit facilities that are available until 2021, our liquidity is strong and is expected to meet our ongoing cash and debt service requirements. Total interest-bearing debt was $7.5 billion at December 31, 2016, compared to $5.1 billion at December 31, 2015.\nOn February 19, 2015, the company entered into a \u00a33.3 billion unsecured, committed bridge loan agreement (the Bridge Facility), pursuant to which lending institutions agreed, subject to limited conditions, to provide the financing necessary to pay the cash portion of the consideration payable to Rexam's shareholders upon consummation of the acquisition of Rexam along with related fees and expenses. In December 2015, the company issued senior notes totaling $1 billion and \u20ac400 million, all due in 2020, and \u20ac700 million due in 2023, with rates of 4.375 percent, 3.5 percent and 4.375 percent, respectively. Pursuant to the terms of the Bridge Facility, the company deposited the net proceeds from the issuance of such notes into escrow accounts, recorded as restricted cash, which reduced the commitments under the Bridge Facility to \u00a31.9 billion.\nOn February 19, 2015, the company entered into a $3 billion revolving credit facility (the 2018 Revolver) to replace its then existing approximate $1 billion revolving credit facility, repay its $93 million Term C loan, repay the outstanding balance on the existing revolving credit facility, redeem the 2020 and 2021 senior notes and provide ongoing liquidity for the company. In June 2015, during a subsequent debt offering, the company issued $1 billion of 5.25 percent senior notes, thereby reducing the borrowing capacity under the 2018 Revolver from $3 billion to $2.25 billion. In March 2016, the 2018 revolver was refinanced in full with a $1.5 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility available to Ball and certain of its subsidiaries (the 2021 Revolver).\nOn March 18, 2016, Ball refinanced the Bridge Facility in full with a $1.4 billion Term A loan facility available to Ball and a \u20ac1.1 billion Term A loan facility available to a subsidiary of Ball. The Term A Loan facilities and 2021 Revolver were entered under a secured, five-year credit agreement.\nIn July 2016, $3.8 billion of proceeds released from the restricted cash escrow accounts and amounts drawn under the $1.4 billion Term A loan facility and the \u20ac1.1 billion Term A loan facility were used to pay the cash portion of the consideration due to Rexam's shareholders for the acquisition of Rexam.\nAt December 31, 2016, taking into account outstanding letters of credit, approximately $1.2 billion was available under the company's long-term, multi-currency committed revolving credit facilities, which are available until March 2021. In addition to these facilities, the company had $821 million of short-term uncommitted credit facilities available at December 31, 2016, of which $143 million was outstanding and due on demand. These amounts are available without violating our existing debt covenants. At December 31, 2015, the company had $23 million outstanding under short-term uncommitted credit facilities.\nWhile ongoing financial and economic conditions in certain areas may raise concerns about credit risk with counterparties to derivative transactions, the company mitigates its exposure by allocating the risk among various counterparties and limiting exposure to any one party. We also monitor the credit ratings of our suppliers, customers, lenders and counterparties on a regular basis.\nWe were in compliance with all loan agreements at December 31, 2016, and all prior years presented, and have met all debt payment obligations. The U.S. note agreements and bank credit agreement contain certain restrictions relating to dividends, investments, financial ratios, guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness. The most restrictive of the company's debt covenants requires the company to maintain a leverage ratio (as defined) of no greater than 5 times on December 31, 2016, which changes to 4 times at December 31, 2017. The company was in compliance with all loan agreements and debt covenants at December 31, 2016, and 2015, and has met all debt payment obligations. As of December 31, 2016, the amounts disclosed as available under the company's long-term multi-currency committed revolving facilities, the short-term uncommitted credit facilities and the unsecured, committed bridge loan agreement, are available without violating our existing debt covenants. Additional details about our debt are available in Note 14 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report.\nOther Liquidity Measures\nFree Cash Flow\nManagement internally uses a free cash flow measure to: (1) evaluate the company's liquidity, (2) evaluate strategic investments, (3) plan stock buyback and dividend levels and (4) evaluate the company's ability to incur and service debt. Free cash flow is not a defined term under U.S. GAAP, and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is typically derived directly from the company's consolidated statement of cash flows; however, it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods.\nBased on the above definition, our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows:\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,007 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,012 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCapital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(606) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(528) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(391) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFree cash flow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(412) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased on information currently available, we estimate cash flows from operating activities for 2017 to be in the range of $1.3 billion, capital expenditures to be approximately $500 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $800 million. In 2017, we intend to utilize our operating cash flow to service debt and to fund our growth capital projects, dividend payments, stock buybacks and, to the extent available, acquisitions that meet our various criteria. Of the total 2017 estimated capital expenditures, approximately $200 million was contractually committed as of December 31, 2016.\nCommitments\nCash payments required for long-term debt maturities, rental payments under noncancellable operating leases, purchase obligations and other commitments in effect at December 31, 2016, are summarized in the following table:\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayments Due By Period (a)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMore than\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt, including capital leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,389 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,416 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,476 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest payments on long-term debt (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,521 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPurchase obligations (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,500 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,674 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,746 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal payments on contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n15,670 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,052 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,769 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,699 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,150 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)Amounts reported in local currencies have been translated at year end 2016 exchange rates.\n(b)For variable rate facilities, amounts are based on interest rates in effect at year end and do not contemplate the effects of any hedging instruments utilized by the company.\n(c)The company's purchase obligations include capital expenditures and contracted amounts for aluminum, steel and other direct materials. Also included are commitments for purchases of natural gas and electricity, expenses related to aerospace and technologies contracts and other less significant items. In cases where variable prices and/or usage are involved, management's best estimates have been used. Depending on the circumstances, early termination of the contracts may or may not result in penalties and, therefore, actual payments could vary significantly.\nThe table above does not include $77 million of uncertain tax positions, the timing of which is unknown at this time.\nContributions to the company's defined benefit pension plans, not including the unfunded German, Swedish and certain U.S. plans, are expected to be in the range of $190 million in 2017. This estimate may change based on changes in the Pension Protection Act, actual plan asset performance and available company cash flow, among other factors. Benefit\npayments related to these plans are expected to be approximately $360 million to $370 million for each of the years ending December 31, 2017, through 2021 and a total of $1.9 billion for the years 2022 through 2026. Payments to participants in the unfunded German, Swedish and certain U.S. plans are expected to be approximately $20 million to $22 million in each of the years 2017 through 2021 and a total of $87 million for the years 2022 through 2026.\nBased on changes in return on asset and discount rate assumptions, as well as revisions based on plan experience studies, total pension expense in 2017 is anticipated to be approximately $80 million lower than in 2016 due non-recurring curtailment charge of $80 million in 2016. A reduction of the expected return on pension assets assumption by one quarter of a percentage point would result in an estimated $15 million increase in the 2017 pension expense, while a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate applied to the pension liability would result in an estimated $2 million reduction of pension expense in 2017.\nContingencies\nThe company is routinely subject to litigation incident to operating its businesses, and has been designated by various federal and state environmental agencies as a potentially responsible party, along with numerous other companies, for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites, including in respect of sites related to alleged activities of certain Rexam subsidiaries. The company believes the matters identified will not have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company. Details of the company's legal proceedings are included in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis report contains forward-looking\u201d statements concerning future events and financial performance. Words such as expects,\u201d anticipates,\u201d estimates,\u201d believes,\u201d targets,\u201d likely\u201d and similar expressions typically identify forward-looking statements, which are generally any statements other than statements of historical fact. Such statements are based on current expectations or views of the future and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Readers of this report should therefore not place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements and any of such statements should be read in conjunction with, and, qualified in their entirety by, the cautionary statements referenced below. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Key factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to be different are summarized in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Exhibit 99 in our Form 10-K, which are available on our website and at www.sec.gov. Some factors that could cause the company's actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed include, but are not limited to the following: a) in our packaging segments: product demand fluctuations; availability/cost of raw materials; competitive packaging, pricing and substitution; changes in climate and weather; competitive activity; failure to achieve synergies, productivity improvements or cost reductions; mandatory deposit or other restrictive packaging laws; customer and supplier consolidation, power and supply chain influence; changes in major customer or supplier contracts or a loss of a major customer or supplier; political instability and sanctions; currency controls; and changes in foreign exchange or tax rates; b) in our aerospace segment: funding, authorization, availability and returns of government and commercial contracts; and delays, extensions and technical uncertainties affecting segment contracts; c) in the company as a whole, those listed plus: changes in senior management; regulatory action or issues including tax, environmental, health and workplace safety, including U.S. FDA and other actions or public concerns affecting products filled in our containers, or chemicals or substances used in raw materials or in the manufacturing process; technological developments and innovations; litigation; strikes; labor cost changes; rates of return on assets of the company's defined benefit retirement plans; pension changes; uncertainties surrounding geopolitical events and governmental policies both in the U.S. and in other countries, including the U.S. government elections, budget, sequestration and debt limit; reduced cash flow; ability to achieve cost-out initiatives and synergies; interest rates affecting our debt; and successful or unsuccessful acquisitions and divestitures, including with respect to the Rexam PLC acquisition and its integration, or the associated divestiture; the effect of the acquisition or the divestiture on our business relationships, operating results and business generally.", "item_7_truncated": "Our effective income tax rate is affected by recurring items such as income earned in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates that differ from the U.S. tax rate and by discrete items that may occur in any given year but that are not consistent from year to year. In 2016, we incurred a significant amount of nonrecurring business consolidation costs primarily in the U.S. The resulting reduction in earnings before income tax as a result of these costs increased the impact of permanent income tax items on the company's effective tax rate in 2016, as compared to 2015. We are uncertain whether the rate reduction impacts experienced in 2016 will continue in future years.\nSegment sales in 2016 were relatively unchanged compared to 2015. Comparable operating earnings in 2016 increased $6 million compared to 2015 due to individually immaterial items.\nAs of December 31, 2016, approximately $597 million of our cash was held outside of the U.S. In the event that we would need to utilize any of the cash held outside of the U.S. for purposes within the U.S., there are no material legal or other economic restrictions regarding the repatriation of cash from any of the countries outside the U.S. where we have cash, other than market liquidity constraints that limit the ability to convert Egyptian pounds held by the Company in Egypt with a U.S. dollar equivalent value of $86 million into other currencies. The company believes its U.S. operating cash flows; the $1.2 billion available under the company's long-term, revolving credit facilities; the $821 million available under other U.S.-based uncommitted short-term credit facilities; and availability under U.S.-based committed and uncommitted accounts receivable factoring programs will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of the U.S. portion of the company's ongoing operations, scheduled principal and interest payments on U.S. debt, dividend payments, capital expenditures and other U.S. cash requirements. If foreign funds would be needed for our U.S. cash requirements and we are unable to provide the funds through intercompany financing arrangements, we will be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes, net of applicable foreign tax credits, to repatriate funds from foreign locations where the company has previously asserted indefinite reinvestment of funds outside the U.S. However, it continues to be the company's intent to permanently reinvest these foreign amounts outside the U.S., and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the foreign amounts to fund our U.S. cash requirements.\nThe valuations of currency exchange and interest rates were a primary driver for the amounts recorded in business consolidation and other activities in 2016, and we expect these impacts to be greatly diminished in the future.

These amounts represented 6 percent, 6 percent and 5 percent of consolidated net sales for those three years, respectively. The increase in SG&A expenses in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to additional SG&A from the acquired Rexam business, which will be reduced in 2017 through cost-out initiatives, and foreign exchange losses of $27 million for the devaluation of the Egyptian pound in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in SG&A expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to lower incentive compensation and net favorable foreign currency effects in SG&A, partially offset by deferred compensation expense related to director retirements in 2015.\nManagement's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which include additional information about our accounting policies, practices and the transactions underlying our financial results. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes, environmental and other matters arising during the normal course of business. We apply our best judgment, our knowledge of existing facts and circumstances and actions that we may undertake in the future in determining the estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2015, during a subsequent debt offering, the company issued $1 billion of 5.25 percent senior notes, thereby reducing the borrowing capacity under the 2018 Revolver from $3 billion to $2.25 billion. In March 2016, the 2018 revolver was refinanced in full with a $1.5 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility available to Ball and certain of its subsidiaries (the 2021 Revolver).\nContributions to the company's defined benefit pension plans, not including the unfunded German, Swedish and certain U.S. plans, are expected to be in the range of $190 million in 2017.

See Note 5 located in Item 8 of this annual report for additional information on the activity in business consolidation and other activities.\nThe year-over-year increase in business consolidation and other activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to an increase of $202 million for transaction related costs, foreign currency exchange losses of $159 million on foreign currency-denominated restricted cash and debt and $108 million in expense for compensation arrangements, all associated with the Rexam acquisition and the sale of the Divestment Business. The increase was partially offset by a gain of $344 million in connection with the sale of the Divestment Business.\nCash payments required for long-term debt maturities, rental payments under noncancellable operating leases, purchase obligations and other commitments in effect at December 31, 2016, are summarized in the following table:\nDebt Facilities and Refinancing\nFood and Aerosol Packaging\nBeverage Packaging, South America\n(a)Further details of these items are included in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report.\nIn February 2015, we completed the acquisition of Sonoco's metal end and closure manufacturing facilities in Canton, Ohio. During the first quarter of 2016, we announced the closure of our food and aerosol packaging flat sheet production and end-making facility in Weirton, West Virginia, which is expected to cease production in early 2017. In October 2016, we sold our specialty tin manufacturing facility in Baltimore, Maryland.\n \u00b7 Expanding further into new products and capabilities by the acquisition of Sonoco's metal end and closure manufacturing facilities in Canton, Ohio, in February 2015; successfully commercializing extruded aluminum aerosol packaging that utilizes a significant amount of recycled material; and successfully commercializing the next generation aluminum bottle-shaping technology; \nTotal interest expense was $338 million in 2016 compared to $260 million in 2015 and $193 million in 2014. Excluding debt refinancing and other costs, interest expense in 2016 was higher compared to 2015 as the company incurred additional debt to pay a portion of the cash consideration due to Rexam's shareholders for the Rexam acquisition. Excluding debt refinancing and other costs, interest expense in 2015 was lower compared to 2014 due to lower interest rates on newly issued long-term debt and the retirement of higher interest rate long-term debt. Interest expense, excluding the effect of debt refinancing and other costs, as a percentage of average monthly borrowings was 4 percent in each of the years 2016 and 2015 and 5 percent in 2014.\nAdditional Segment Information\nThe company's share repurchases, net of issuances, totaled $59 million in 2016, $100 million in 2015 and $360 million in 2014. The repurchases were completed using cash on hand and available borrowings and included accelerated share repurchase agreements and other purchases under our ongoing share repurchase program. Additional details about our share repurchase activities are provided in Note 17 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report.\n\nBased on information currently available, we estimate cash flows from operating activities for 2017 to be in the range of $1.3 billion, capital expenditures to be approximately $500 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $800 million. In 2017, we intend to utilize our operating cash flow to service debt and to fund our growth capital projects, dividend payments, stock buybacks and, to the extent available, acquisitions that meet our various criteria. Of the total 2017 estimated capital expenditures, approximately $200 million was contractually committed as of December 31, 2016.\nOur Drive for 10 vision encompasses five strategic levers that are key to growing our business and achieving long-term success. Since launching Drive for 10 in 2011, we made progress on each of the levers as follows:\nThe effective tax rate for 2015 was 14 percent compared to 23 percent in 2014. The decrease in the rate for 2015 was primarily due to a 2.7 percentage point reduction related to the tax effect of statutory foreign exchange losses in our Brazilian operations, a 2.3 percentage point reduction related to the settlement of various uncertain tax positions, a 1.4 percentage point reduction related to the favorable settlement of a prior year IRS audit and a reduction in our rate of 3.0 percentage points due to an increase in U.S. research and development tax credits.\nBusiness consolidation and other activities were $337 million in 2016 compared to $195 million in 2015 and $81million in 2014. These amounts represented 4 percent, 2 percent and 1 percent of consolidated net sales for the three years, respectively.\nContracted backlog for the aerospace segment at December 31, 2016 and 2015, was $1.4 billion and $617 million, respectively. The year-over-year increase reflects several major contract awards during 2016. The segment has numerous outstanding bids for future contract awards. The backlog at December 31, 2016, consisted of 69 percent cost-type contracts. Comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations due to the nature of varying delivery and milestone schedules on contracts, funding of programs and the uncertainty of timing of future contract awards.\nCost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization, was $7,296 million in 2016 compared to $6,460 million in 2015 and $6,903 million in 2014. These amounts represented 81 percent of consolidated net sales for each of these years. Cost of sales in 2016 included expense of $84 million for the step-up of inventory related to the acquired Rexam business.\n(a)Further details of these items are included in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report.\nWhile ongoing financial and economic conditions in certain areas may raise concerns about credit risk with counterparties to derivative transactions, the company mitigates its exposure by allocating the risk among various counterparties and limiting exposure to any one party. We also monitor the credit ratings of our suppliers, customers, lenders and counterparties on a regular basis.\nbusiness. These decreases were partially offset by a gain of $344 million in 2016 recognized on the sale of the Ball legacy portion of the Divestment Business, $173 million lower income tax expense in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the tax impacts of the sale of the Divestment Business, earnings from the increase in net sales from the acquired Rexam business, net of the sale of Ball's legacy portion of the Divestment Business, lower net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests and higher equity in results of affiliates.\nInterest Expense\n(a)Further details of these items are included in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report.\nBall Corporation is one of the world's leading suppliers of metal packaging to the beverage, food, personal care and household products industries. Our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses, are manufactured in facilities around the world and are competitive with other substrates, such as plastics and glass. In the rigid packaging industry, sales and earnings can be increased by reducing costs, increasing prices, developing new products, expanding volumes and making strategic acquisitions. We also provide aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers.\nDuring the third quarter of 2016, Ball made certain segment realignments as a result of the Rexam acquisition and sale of the Divestment Business to align with how Ball now manages its businesses. Ball has retrospectively adjusted prior period amounts to conform to the current segment presentation. Ball's operations are organized and reviewed by management along its product lines and geographical areas and presented in the five reportable segments discussed below.\nComparable operating earnings in 2016 were $105 million higher compared to 2015. The second half of 2016 included earnings from the Rexam business while the second half of 2015 included the company's smaller legacy Brazil business, the significant portion of which was sold with the Divestment Business.\nManagement Performance Measures\nOther Liquidity Measures\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThese ongoing business developments and the successful acquisition of Rexam completed on June 30, 2016, help us stay close to our customers while expanding and/or sustaining our industry positions with major beverage, food, personal care, household products and aerospace customers.\nIn July 2016, $3.8 billion of proceeds released from the restricted cash escrow accounts and amounts drawn under the $1.4 billion Term A loan facility and the \u20ac1.1 billion Term A loan facility were used to pay the cash portion of the consideration due to Rexam's shareholders for the acquisition of Rexam.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nBusiness Overview and Industry Trends\n\nAcquisition of Rexam\nOn March 18, 2016, Ball refinanced the Bridge Facility in full with a $1.4 billion Term A loan facility available to Ball and a \u20ac1.1 billion Term A loan facility available to a subsidiary of Ball. The Term A Loan facilities and 2021 Revolver were entered under a secured, five-year credit agreement.\nThe following financial measurements are on a non-U.S. GAAP basis and should be considered in connection with the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report.

The revisions had no impact on the company's non-GAAP measures of comparable operating earnings or comparable net earnings in the second or third quarters of 2016 or for the full year ended December 31, 2016. Non-U.S. GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to, or a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. A presentation of earnings in accordance with U.S. GAAP is available in Item 8 of this annual report.\nWe sell our packaging products mainly to large, multinational beverage, food, personal care and household products companies with which we have developed long-term relationships. This is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of long-term supply contracts. While we have a diversified customer base, we sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major companies in North, Central and South America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa, as do our equity joint ventures in Guatemala, Panama, South Korea, the U.S. and Vietnam. The overall metal container industry is growing globally and is expected to continue to grow in the medium to long term despite the North American industry seeing a continued decline in standard-sized aluminum beverage packaging for the carbonated soft drink market. The primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace segment are U.S. government agencies or their prime contractors.\nCash flows from operations in 2015 were comparable to 2014 as lower pension contributions were offset by lower net earnings, lower cash inflows from working capital and cash paid for transaction costs for the acquisition of Rexam. The working capital changes were primarily related to slightly higher days sales outstanding, partially offset by lower inventory volumes and higher days payable outstanding. Days sales outstanding increased from 34 days to 35 days, inventory days on hand decreased from 52 days to 49 days and days payable outstanding increased from 69 days to 82 days. The increase in days payables outstanding is primarily due to renegotiation of payment terms in supplier contracts in North America.\nWe were in compliance with all loan agreements at December 31, 2016, and all prior years presented, and have met all debt payment obligations. The U.S. note agreements and bank credit agreement contain certain restrictions relating to dividends, investments, financial ratios, guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness. The most restrictive of the company's debt covenants requires the company to maintain a leverage ratio (as defined) of no greater than 5 times on December 31, 2016, which changes to 4 times at December 31, 2017. The company was in compliance with all loan agreements and debt covenants at December 31, 2016, and 2015, and has met all debt payment obligations. As of December 31, 2016, the amounts disclosed as available under the company's long-term multi-currency committed revolving facilities, the short-term uncommitted credit facilities and the unsecured, committed bridge loan agreement, are available without violating our existing debt covenants. Additional details about our debt are available in Note 14 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report.\nAnnual cash dividends paid on common stock were 52 cents per share in each of 2016, 2015 and 2014. Total dividends paid were $83 million in 2016, $72 million in 2015 and $73 million in 2014. We paid dividends to noncontrolling interests of $18 million in 2015 and $12 million in 2014. No dividends were paid to noncontrolling interests in 2016.\nThe company announced on March 2, 2017, that it intends to cease production at its Recklinghausen, Germany, facility only after due negotiation and agreement with the Works Council.\nOVERVIEW\nSegment sales in 2016 were $262 million higher compared to 2015. The second half of 2016 included sales volumes from the Rexam business while the second half of 2015 included the company's legacy European business, the significant portion of which was sold with the Divestment Business.\nWe purchase our raw materials from relatively few suppliers. We also have exposure to inflation, in particular the rising costs of raw materials, as well as other direct cost inputs. We mitigate our exposure to the changes in the costs of metal through the inclusion of provisions in contracts covering the majority of our volumes to pass through metal price changes, as well as through the use of derivative instruments. The pass-through provisions generally result in proportional increases or decreases in sales and costs with a greatly reduced impact, if any, on net earnings. Because of our customer and supplier concentration, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss, insolvency or bankruptcy of a major customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a major customer or supplier, although our contract provisions generally mitigate the risk of customer loss, and our long-term relationships represent a known, stable customer base.\nBased on the above definition, our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows:\nCash flows from operations in 2016 were lower compared to 2015 due to increased operating cash outflows in 2016 due to payments of professional fees and employee costs related to the acquisition of Rexam and sale of the Divestment Business of approximately $325 million; $297 million of additional pension funding, including $171 million related to the acquired Rexam U.K. defined benefit plan; approximately $150 million less cash inflows from working capital due to the sale of the company's legacy European business at its peak working capital requirements; $90 million of payments to settle derivatives associated with the acquired Rexam business; and $50 million of additional interest payments associated with the financing of the Rexam acquisition. Inventory days on hand increased from 49 days to 68 days, days sales outstanding increased from 35 days to 46 days and days payable outstanding increased from 82 days to 97 days. The increase in days outstanding is primarily attributable to the working capital positions of the acquired Rexam operations as compared to the legacy Ball operations included in the Divestment Business.\nThe consummation of the acquisition was subject to, among other things, approval from Ball's shareholders, approval from Rexam's shareholders, certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, all of which were satisfied prior to closing. In order to satisfy certain regulatory requirements, the company was required to sell some of its existing beverage packaging businesses and select beverage can assets of Rexam (the Divestment Business).\nSales in 2016 were $1.1 billion higher compared to 2015 primarily as a result of increased sales of $1.5 billion related to the acquired Rexam business, net of Ball's legacy sales included in the Divestment Business. This increase was partially offset by lower metal input costs passed through to customers of $299 million. Net earnings in 2016 were lower than 2015 primarily due to $142 million higher business consolidation and other activities from increased costs associated with the Rexam acquisition and the sale of the Divestment Business, $167 million of increased depreciation and amortization primarily attributable to depreciation and amortization associated with the acquired Rexam business, recognition in cost of sales of $84 million step-up of inventory related to the acquired Rexam business, higher interest expense of $78 million associated with the net increase in borrowings to fund the cash portion of the purchase price of Rexam and $62 million increased selling, general and administrative costs also due to costs from the acquired Rexam\nBased on changes in return on asset and discount rate assumptions, as well as revisions based on plan experience studies, total pension expense in 2017 is anticipated to be approximately $80 million lower than in 2016 due non-recurring curtailment charge of $80 million in 2016. A reduction of the expected return on pension assets assumption by one quarter of a percentage point would result in an estimated $15 million increase in the 2017 pension expense, while a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate applied to the pension liability would result in an estimated $2 million reduction of pension expense in 2017.\nSales to the U.S. government, either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as a subcontractor, represented 97 percent of segment sales in 2016 compared to 96 percent of segment sales in 2015 and 95 percent in 2014. The aerospace contract mix in 2016 consisted of 55 percent cost-type contracts, which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon and/or earned profit component, and 39 percent fixed-price contracts. The remaining sales were for time and materials contracts.\nManagement internally uses a free cash flow measure to: (1) evaluate the company's liquidity, (2) evaluate strategic investments, (3) plan stock buyback and dividend levels and (4) evaluate the company's ability to incur and service debt. Free cash flow is not a defined term under U.S. GAAP, and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is typically derived directly from the company's consolidated statement of cash flows; however, it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods.\nWe recognize sales under long-term contracts in the aerospace segment using percentage-of-completion under the cost-to-cost method of accounting. Throughout the period of contract performance, we regularly reevaluate and, if necessary, revise our estimates of aerospace total contract revenue, total contract cost and progress toward completion. Because of contract payment schedules, limitations on funding and other contract terms, our sales and accounts receivable for this segment include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed.\nComparable operating earnings in 2016 were $67 million higher compared to 2015 primarily due to the earnings from the acquired Rexam business. Improved product mix from the legacy Ball business also contributed to the favorable year-over-year operating earnings improvement.\n\nDue to the U.S. tax status of certain of Ball's subsidiaries in Canada and the PRC, the company annually provides U.S. taxes on foreign earnings in those subsidiaries, net of any estimated foreign tax credits. Current taxes are also provided on certain other undistributed earnings that are currently taxed in the U.S. Net U.S. taxes provided for Brazil, Canada and PRC earnings in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $21 million, $2 million and $12 million, respectively. Management's intention is to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of Ball's remaining foreign investments and, as a result, no U.S. income or federal withholding tax provision has been made. The indefinite reinvestment assertion is supported by both long-term and short-term forecasts and U.S. financial requirements, including, but not limited to, operating cash flows, capital expenditures, debt maturities and dividends. The company has not provided deferred taxes on earnings in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in its international operations. Retained earnings in non-U.S. subsidiaries were $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2016. It is not practical to estimate the additional taxes that may become payable for the portion of these foreign earnings that have not already been taxed in the U.S.; however, repatriation of these earnings could result in a material increase in the company's income tax liabilities.\nThe 2016 full year effective income tax rate was negative 100.8 percent compared to 13.6 percent for 2015. The lower tax rate in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a 116.0 percentage point reduction for the tax benefit recorded with respect to tax deductible goodwill in a legal entity restructuring in Brazil that was completed in the current year. The tax rate was also reduced by 56.8 percentage points for increased benefits from foreign tax rate differences, primarily due to acquisitions, and by 49.6 percentage points for permanent tax differences on significant current year business dispositions. These amounts were partially offset by a 41.6 percentage point increase for non-deductible transaction costs related to current year acquisitions and a 36.8 percentage point increase for current year increases in valuation allowances, primarily on losses in the U.K.\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $453 million in 2016 compared to $286 million in 2015 and $281 million in 2014. These amounts represented 5 percent, 4 percent and 3 percent of consolidated net sales for those three years, respectively. Depreciation expense was higher in 2016 than in 2015 primarily due to the acquired Rexam fixed assets. Amortization in 2016 included $65 million for the amortization of acquired Rexam intangibles.\nManagement internally uses various measures to evaluate company performance such as return on average invested capital (net operating earnings after tax over the relevant performance period divided by average invested capital over the same period); economic value added (EVA\u00ae) dollars (net operating earnings after tax less a capital charge on average invested capital employed); earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT); earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA); and diluted earnings per share. Management also uses free cash flow (generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures) as a measure to evaluate the company's liquidity. Please refer to the Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources section below for additional information on the company's use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure. We believe this information is also useful to investors as it provides insight into the earnings and cash flow criteria management uses to make strategic decisions. These financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods such as business consolidation costs and gains or losses on acquisitions and dispositions.\nOn June 30, 2016, Ball acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of Rexam, a United Kingdom based beverage container manufacturer, for the purchase price of \u00a32.9 billion ($3.8 billion) in cash, and 32.25 million treasury shares of Ball Corporation common stock (valued at $71.39 per share for a total share consideration of $2.3 billion). The common shares were valued using the price on the date of acquisition and were presented as a reduction of treasury stock. The cash portion of the acquisition price was paid in July 2016 using proceeds from restricted cash held in escrow and borrowings under the $1.4 billion and \u20ac1.1 billion Term A loan facilities obtained in March 2016.\nBeverage Packaging, Europe\nAt December 31, 2016, taking into account outstanding letters of credit, approximately $1.2 billion was available under the company's long-term, multi-currency committed revolving credit facilities, which are available until March 2021. In addition to these facilities, the company had $821 million of short-term uncommitted credit facilities available at December 31, 2016, of which $143 million was outstanding and due on demand. These amounts are available without violating our existing debt covenants. At December 31, 2015, the company had $23 million outstanding under short-term uncommitted credit facilities.\n \u00b7 Maximizing value in our existing businesses by rationalizing standard beverage container and end capacity in North America and expanding specialty container production to meet current demand; leveraging plant floor systems in our beverage facilities to improve efficiencies and reduce costs; consolidating and/or closing multiple beverage and food and aerosol packaging facilities to gain efficiencies; and in food and aerosol packaging segment, installing new extruded aluminum aerosol lines in our existing Devizes, U.K., and Czech Republic facilities while also implementing cost-out and value-in initiatives across all of our businesses; \nThe decreased debt refinancing and other costs in 2016 compared to 2015 included mark-to-market losses on derivative financial instruments designed to mitigate exposure to interest rate changes for debt issuances related to the Rexam acquisition, interest expense on issued 3.5 percent and 4.375 percent senior notes used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Rexam acquisition, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing charges for the partial extinguishment of the committed bridge loan agreement, and the revolving credit facility and amortization of deferred financing costs for the committed bridge loan agreement. See Notes 14 and 20 located in Item 8 of this annual report for additional information on the activity in debt refinancing and other costs.\nSegment sales in 2015 were higher than in 2014 due to favorable price mix variance of $50 million, partially offset by lower sales volume of $35 million. Comparable operating earnings in 2015 were $14 million higher compared to 2014 due primarily to improved manufacturing performance.\nSegment Results\nThe company is routinely subject to litigation incident to operating its businesses, and has been designated by various federal and state environmental agencies as a potentially responsible party, along with numerous other companies, for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites, including in respect of sites related to alleged activities of certain Rexam subsidiaries. The company believes the matters identified will not have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company. Details of the company's legal proceedings are included in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report.\nCost of Sales (Excluding Depreciation and Amortization)\nThe decrease in net sales in 2015 compared to 2014 was due to unfavorable foreign currency effects in Europe, lower metal food container sales volumes due to a customer shift in North American steel food containers and unfavorable pricing in the PRC, partially offset by higher beverage packaging sales volumes. Net earnings were lower in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower sales, unfavorable currency effects, higher business consolidation and other activities and higher debt refinancing and other costs, partially offset by a lower tax rate in 2015 and cost reduction efforts by all business segments.\nSegment sales in 2016 were $126 million lower compared to 2015 as a result of $57 million in lower prices resulting from lower metal costs passed through to customers and $69 million in volume primarily driven by lower food can sales volumes. Comparable operating earnings in 2016 were relatively unchanged compared to 2015 due to improved extruded aluminum sales which offset the decline in food can sales volumes.\n\nBeverage Packaging, North and Central America\nFree Cash Flow\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and external committed borrowings. We believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by short-term, long-term and committed revolver borrowings, when necessary, will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditures. The following summarizes our cash flows:\nSegment sales in 2015 were $207 million lower compared to 2014 due primarily to lower metal food container sales volumes of $260 million, mainly related to a customer shift effective January 2015, and unfavorable currency exchange effects of $37 million, partially offset by favorable product mix of $90 million. The customer shift was the result of the loss of a significant customer upon expiration of their contract in December 2014. The volume reductions were offset by favorable product mix from a higher proportion of aerosol product sales, which is expected to continue. Comparable operating earnings in 2015 decreased $46 million compared to 2014 due primarily to earnings impacts from lower sales volumes, unfavorable currency exchange effects, unfavorable startup costs, partially offset by extruded aluminum aerosol growth in Europe, the earnings from the Sonoco acquisition and reduced selling, general and administrative costs.\nSegment sales in 2016 were $410 million higher compared to 2015. The increase in 2016 was primarily due to the increase in sales volumes of $526 million from the acquired Rexam business partially offset by lower metal input prices of $176 million. We cannot predict future changes in metal input prices and beverage can sales volumes.\nResults of Business Segments\nSegment sales in 2016 were $423 million higher compared to 2015. The second half of 2016 included sales volumes from the Rexam business while the second half of 2015 included the company's smaller legacy Brazil business, the significant portion of which was sold with the Divestment Business.\nThe beverage packaging, Europe, segment includes the manufacture and sale of metal beverage containers in facilities located throughout Europe, including Russia. To support growth for beverage cans in the Iberian Peninsula, the company is constructing a two-line, aluminum beverage can manufacturing facility near Madrid, Spain, with most of the new capacity secured under a long-term customer contract. The facility is expected to be fully operational in 2018 and will produce multiple can sizes.\nTax Provision\n\nFor information regarding the company's critical and significant accounting policies, as well as recent accounting pronouncements, see Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report.\nSegment sales in 2015 were relatively unchanged from 2014 due to higher sales volumes of $63 million partially offset by unfavorable price/mix changes of $60 million. Comparable operating earnings in 2015 were $15 million lower compared to 2014 due primarily to unfavorable manufacturing costs of $86 million partially offset by higher sales volumes and favorable product mix of $74 million.\n\nThe increased debt refinancing and other costs in 2015 compared to 2014 included mark-to-market losses on derivative financial instruments designed to mitigate exposure to interest rates changes for debt issuances related to the Rexam acquisition, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing charges for the partial extinguishment of the committed bridge loan agreement and the revolving credit facility, interest expense on 3.5 percent and 4.375 percent senior notes issued to fund a portion of the purchase price of the Rexam acquisition, amortization of deferred financing costs for the committed bridge loan agreement and the redemption of the 6.75 percent and 5.75 percent senior notes. See Notes 14 and 20 located in Item 8 of this annual report for additional information on financial instruments.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nFor additional information regarding our segments, see the business segment information in Note 3 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report. The charges recorded for business consolidation and other activities were based on estimates by Ball management and were developed from information available at the time. If actual outcomes vary from the estimates, the differences will be reflected in current period earnings in the consolidated statement of earnings and identified as business consolidation gains and losses. Additional details about our business consolidation and other activities are provided in Note 5 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGiven our cash flow projections and unused credit facilities that are available until 2021, our liquidity is strong and is expected to meet our ongoing cash and debt service requirements. Total interest-bearing debt was $7.5 billion at December 31, 2016, compared to $5.1 billion at December 31, 2015.\nThe aerospace segment consists of the manufacture and sale of aerospace and other related products and services provided for the defense, civil space and commercial space industries.\n\n(a) Further details of these items are included in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report.\nDebt refinancing and other costs were $109 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. These costs consisted of (1) interest expense of $49 million through June 30, 2016, on the 3.5 percent and 4.375 percent senior notes issued in December 2015, (2) fair value changes of $20 million on derivative instruments designed to mitigate risks of interest rate changes with debt issuances, (3) interest expense of $30 million through June 30, 2016, on Term A U.S. dollar and Term A euro dollar loans associated with the company's credit facility, and (4) amortization of deferred financing fees of $7 million for the Bridge Facility. See Notes 14 and 20 in Item 8 of this annual report for additional information on these instruments and the transactions flowing through debt refinancing and other costs.\n\n(a)Further details of these items are included in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report.\n \u00b7 Broadening our geographic reach with our acquisition of Rexam and our new investments in a beverage manufacturing facility in Myanmar, as well as an extruded aluminum aerosol manufacturing facility in India, and the construction of a beverage container facility in Monterrey, Mexico, producing cans and ends; and \n(a)Amounts reported in local currencies have been translated at year end 2016 exchange rates.\nCorporate Strategy\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\ninterest rate changes with anticipated debt issuances for a portion of the cash consideration payable in the acquisition of Rexam, (3) write-offs of unamortized deferred financing fees and other charges of $16 million for the partial extinguishment of the committed bridge loan agreement, the partial extinguishment of the revolving credit facility, and refinance of the senior credit facility, (4) the amortization of deferred financing fees of $23 million on the Bridge Facility, and (5) write off of unamortized deferred financing fees and premiums of $57 million for the redemption of previously issued senior notes and the refinance of senior credit facilities. See Notes 14 and 20 in Item 8 of this annual report for additional information on these instruments and the transactions flowing through debt refinancing and other costs.\n \u00b7 Leveraging our technological expertise in packaging innovation, including the introduction of next-generation aluminum bottle-shaping technologies, the introduction of a new two-piece, lightweight steel aerosol can, G3, technology in our Chestnut Hill, Tennessee, facility and the increased production of lightweight ReAlTM containers with 25 percent recycled aluminum content; and investment in cyber and data analytics to further enhance our aerospace technical expertise across a broader customer portfolio. \nThe beverage packaging, North and Central America, segment consists of operations located in the U.S., Canada and Mexico that manufacture aluminum containers used in beverage packaging. During 2016, our beverage manufacturing facility in Monterrey, Mexico, began production. Also, in 2016, our beverage packaging end-making facility in Bristol, Virginia, ceased production.\nCommitments\nBusiness Consolidation Costs and Other Activities\nThe table above does not include $77 million of uncertain tax positions, the timing of which is unknown at this time.\nBased on the above definitions, our calculation of comparable operating earnings is summarized below:\nSegment sales in 2015 decreased $125 million compared to 2014 primarily due to lower sales from U.S. national defense contracts. Comparable operating earnings in 2015 decreased $12 million compared to 2014 due to lower sales, favorable program performance in 2014 from program and contract completions and increased recovery of pension costs in 2014.\nThe beverage packaging, South America, segment consists of operations located in Brazil, Argentina and Chile that manufacture aluminum containers used in beverage packaging.\nComparable operating earnings in 2016 were $25 million higher compared to 2015. The second half of 2016 included earnings from the Rexam business while the second half of 2015 included earnings from the company's legacy European business, the significant portion of which was sold with the Divestment Business.", "item_7_text": "Our effective income tax rate is affected by recurring items such as income earned in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates that differ from the U.S. tax rate and by discrete items that may occur in any given year but that are not consistent from year to year. In 2016, we incurred a significant amount of nonrecurring business consolidation costs primarily in the U.S. The resulting reduction in earnings before income tax as a result of these costs increased the impact of permanent income tax items on the company's effective tax rate in 2016, as compared to 2015. We are uncertain whether the rate reduction impacts experienced in 2016 will continue in future years.\nSegment sales in 2016 were relatively unchanged compared to 2015. Comparable operating earnings in 2016 increased $6 million compared to 2015 due to individually immaterial items.\nAs of December 31, 2016, approximately $597 million of our cash was held outside of the U.S. In the event that we would need to utilize any of the cash held outside of the U.S. for purposes within the U.S., there are no material legal or other economic restrictions regarding the repatriation of cash from any of the countries outside the U.S. where we have cash, other than market liquidity constraints that limit the ability to convert Egyptian pounds held by the Company in Egypt with a U.S. dollar equivalent value of $86 million into other currencies. The company believes its U.S. operating cash flows; the $1.2 billion available under the company's long-term, revolving credit facilities; the $821 million available under other U.S.-based uncommitted short-term credit facilities; and availability under U.S.-based committed and uncommitted accounts receivable factoring programs will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of the U.S. portion of the company's ongoing operations, scheduled principal and interest payments on U.S. debt, dividend payments, capital expenditures and other U.S. cash requirements. If foreign funds would be needed for our U.S. cash requirements and we are unable to provide the funds through intercompany financing arrangements, we will be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes, net of applicable foreign tax credits, to repatriate funds from foreign locations where the company has previously asserted indefinite reinvestment of funds outside the U.S. However, it continues to be the company's intent to permanently reinvest these foreign amounts outside the U.S., and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the foreign amounts to fund our U.S. cash requirements.\nThe valuations of currency exchange and interest rates were a primary driver for the amounts recorded in business consolidation and other activities in 2016, and we expect these impacts to be greatly diminished in the future. See Notes 4, 5 and 20 located in Item 8 of this annual report for additional information on financial instruments.\npayments related to these plans are expected to be approximately $360 million to $370 million for each of the years ending December 31, 2017, through 2021 and a total of $1.9 billion for the years 2022 through 2026. Payments to participants in the unfunded German, Swedish and certain U.S. plans are expected to be approximately $20 million to $22 million in each of the years 2017 through 2021 and a total of $87 million for the years 2022 through 2026.\nDebt refinancing and other costs were $117 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. These costs consisted of (1) interest expense of $5 million on senior notes issued in December 2015 to fund a portion of the cash consideration of the Rexam acquisition, (2) fair value changes of $16 million on derivative instruments designed to mitigate risks of\nThe food and aerosol packaging segment consists of operations located in the U.S., Europe, Canada, Mexico, Argentina and India that manufacture and sell steel food, aerosol, paint and general line containers, as well as aluminum aerosol containers and slugs.\nThe year-over-year increase in business consolidation and other activities for 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to an increase of $98 million for transaction related costs, $41 million of losses associated with the change in fair value of the collar and option contracts entered into to reduce the exposure to currency exchange rate changes in connection with the British pound denominated cash portion of the Rexam acquisition, net foreign currency gains and losses of $14 million from the revaluation of foreign currency denominated restricted cash and losses of $7 million for cross-currency swaps in connection with the December 2015 issuance of the $1 billion senior notes due 2020. In 2014, the company recorded a non-cash charge of $45 million for the settlement of its pension benefit obligations, and recorded a provision against the balance of a long-term receivable of $17 million as a result of the financial difficulties of a food and aerosol packaging segment customer.\n(b)For variable rate facilities, amounts are based on interest rates in effect at year end and do not contemplate the effects of any hedging instruments utilized by the company.\n(c)The company's purchase obligations include capital expenditures and contracted amounts for aluminum, steel and other direct materials. Also included are commitments for purchases of natural gas and electricity, expenses related to aerospace and technologies contracts and other less significant items. In cases where variable prices and/or usage are involved, management's best estimates have been used. Depending on the circumstances, early termination of the contracts may or may not result in penalties and, therefore, actual payments could vary significantly.\nOn February 19, 2015, the company entered into a \u00a33.3 billion unsecured, committed bridge loan agreement (the Bridge Facility), pursuant to which lending institutions agreed, subject to limited conditions, to provide the financing necessary to pay the cash portion of the consideration payable to Rexam's shareholders upon consummation of the acquisition of Rexam along with related fees and expenses. In December 2015, the company issued senior notes totaling $1 billion and \u20ac400 million, all due in 2020, and \u20ac700 million due in 2023, with rates of 4.375 percent, 3.5 percent and 4.375 percent, respectively. Pursuant to the terms of the Bridge Facility, the company deposited the net proceeds from the issuance of such notes into escrow accounts, recorded as restricted cash, which reduced the commitments under the Bridge Facility to \u00a31.9 billion.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $512 million in 2016 compared to $450 million in 2015 and $466 million in 2014. These amounts represented 6 percent, 6 percent and 5 percent of consolidated net sales for those three years, respectively. The increase in SG&A expenses in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to additional SG&A from the acquired Rexam business, which will be reduced in 2017 through cost-out initiatives, and foreign exchange losses of $27 million for the devaluation of the Egyptian pound in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in SG&A expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to lower incentive compensation and net favorable foreign currency effects in SG&A, partially offset by deferred compensation expense related to director retirements in 2015.\nManagement's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which include additional information about our accounting policies, practices and the transactions underlying our financial results. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes, environmental and other matters arising during the normal course of business. We apply our best judgment, our knowledge of existing facts and circumstances and actions that we may undertake in the future in determining the estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results may differ from these estimates. Ball Corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as Ball Corporation,\u201d Ball,\u201d the company,\u201d we\u201d or our\u201d in the following discussion and analysis.\nCRITICAL AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nAerospace\n \u00b7 Aligning ourselves with the right customers and markets by investing capital to meet double-digit volume growth for specialty beverage containers throughout our global network, which represent more than 30 percent of our global beverage packaging mix; aligning with craft brewers, sparkling water fillers and wine producers who continue to use beverage containers to grow their business; \nContingencies\nWe have entered into several regional committed and uncommitted accounts receivable factoring programs with various financial institutions for certain accounts receivables of the company. Programs accounted for as true sales of the receivables, without recourse to Ball, had combined limits of approximately $970 million at December 31, 2016. A total of $596 million and $479 million were sold under these programs at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Additionally, the company has programs that were not accounted for as true sales of the receivables, with combined limits of $30 million, under which $17 million was sold at December 31, 2016.\nThis report contains forward-looking\u201d statements concerning future events and financial performance. Words such as expects,\u201d anticipates,\u201d estimates,\u201d believes,\u201d targets,\u201d likely\u201d and similar expressions typically identify forward-looking statements, which are generally any statements other than statements of historical fact. Such statements are based on current expectations or views of the future and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Readers of this report should therefore not place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements and any of such statements should be read in conjunction with, and, qualified in their entirety by, the cautionary statements referenced below. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Key factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to be different are summarized in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Exhibit 99 in our Form 10-K, which are available on our website and at www.sec.gov. Some factors that could cause the company's actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed include, but are not limited to the following: a) in our packaging segments: product demand fluctuations; availability/cost of raw materials; competitive packaging, pricing and substitution; changes in climate and weather; competitive activity; failure to achieve synergies, productivity improvements or cost reductions; mandatory deposit or other restrictive packaging laws; customer and supplier consolidation, power and supply chain influence; changes in major customer or supplier contracts or a loss of a major customer or supplier; political instability and sanctions; currency controls; and changes in foreign exchange or tax rates; b) in our aerospace segment: funding, authorization, availability and returns of government and commercial contracts; and delays, extensions and technical uncertainties affecting segment contracts; c) in the company as a whole, those listed plus: changes in senior management; regulatory action or issues including tax, environmental, health and workplace safety, including U.S. FDA and other actions or public concerns affecting products filled in our containers, or chemicals or substances used in raw materials or in the manufacturing process; technological developments and innovations; litigation; strikes; labor cost changes; rates of return on assets of the company's defined benefit retirement plans; pension changes; uncertainties surrounding geopolitical events and governmental policies both in the U.S. and in other countries, including the U.S. government elections, budget, sequestration and debt limit; reduced cash flow; ability to achieve cost-out initiatives and synergies; interest rates affecting our debt; and successful or unsuccessful acquisitions and divestitures, including with respect to the Rexam PLC acquisition and its integration, or the associated divestiture; the effect of the acquisition or the divestiture on our business relationships, operating results and business generally.\nConsolidated Sales and Earnings\nNonfinancial measures in the packaging businesses include production efficiency and spoilage rates; quality control figures; environmental, health and safety statistics; production and sales volumes; asset utilization rates; and measures of sustainability. Additional measures used to evaluate financial performance in the aerospace segment include contract revenue realization, award and incentive fees realized, proposal win rates and backlog (including awarded, contracted and funded backlog).\nOn February 19, 2015, the company entered into a $3 billion revolving credit facility (the 2018 Revolver) to replace its then existing approximate $1 billion revolving credit facility, repay its $93 million Term C loan, repay the outstanding balance on the existing revolving credit facility, redeem the 2020 and 2021 senior notes and provide ongoing liquidity for the company. In June 2015, during a subsequent debt offering, the company issued $1 billion of 5.25 percent senior notes, thereby reducing the borrowing capacity under the 2018 Revolver from $3 billion to $2.25 billion. In March 2016, the 2018 revolver was refinanced in full with a $1.5 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility available to Ball and certain of its subsidiaries (the 2021 Revolver).\nContributions to the company's defined benefit pension plans, not including the unfunded German, Swedish and certain U.S. plans, are expected to be in the range of $190 million in 2017. This estimate may change based on changes in the Pension Protection Act, actual plan asset performance and available company cash flow, among other factors. Benefit\nOur calculation of comparable net earnings is summarized below:\nThe increased business consolidation and other activities in 2015 compared to 2014 included collar and option contract losses, cross-currency swap fair value changes, net currency exchange losses on the restricted cash and debt associated with the Rexam acquisition, and transaction costs related to the acquisition of Rexam. The collar and option contracts, as well as the cross-currency swap, are not accounted for as hedges. See Notes 5 and 20 located in Item 8 of this annual report for additional information on financial instruments.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nSegment sales in 2015 were $243 million lower compared to 2014 due primarily to unfavorable currency exchange effects of $359 million, partially offset by favorable product mix and higher sales volumes. Comparable operating earnings in 2015 were $31 million lower compared to 2014 due primarily to unfavorable currency exchange effects of $56 million and unfavorable manufacturing performance due to new line start-ups, partially offset by favorable sales mix and higher sales volumes.\n\nCash Flows and Capital Expenditures\n\nShare Repurchases\nThe increased business consolidation and other activities in 2016 compared to 2015 included transaction costs related to the acquisition of Rexam, net currency exchange losses on the restricted cash, intercompany loans and debt associated with the Rexam acquisition and Rexam acquisition-related compensation arrangements, partially offset by the gain on sale of the Divestment Business. See Note 5 located in Item 8 of this annual report for additional information on the activity in business consolidation and other activities.\nThe year-over-year increase in business consolidation and other activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to an increase of $202 million for transaction related costs, foreign currency exchange losses of $159 million on foreign currency-denominated restricted cash and debt and $108 million in expense for compensation arrangements, all associated with the Rexam acquisition and the sale of the Divestment Business. The increase was partially offset by a gain of $344 million in connection with the sale of the Divestment Business.\nCash payments required for long-term debt maturities, rental payments under noncancellable operating leases, purchase obligations and other commitments in effect at December 31, 2016, are summarized in the following table:\nDebt Facilities and Refinancing\nFood and Aerosol Packaging\nBeverage Packaging, South America\n(a)Further details of these items are included in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report.\nIn February 2015, we completed the acquisition of Sonoco's metal end and closure manufacturing facilities in Canton, Ohio. During the first quarter of 2016, we announced the closure of our food and aerosol packaging flat sheet production and end-making facility in Weirton, West Virginia, which is expected to cease production in early 2017. In October 2016, we sold our specialty tin manufacturing facility in Baltimore, Maryland.\n \u00b7 Expanding further into new products and capabilities by the acquisition of Sonoco's metal end and closure manufacturing facilities in Canton, Ohio, in February 2015; successfully commercializing extruded aluminum aerosol packaging that utilizes a significant amount of recycled material; and successfully commercializing the next generation aluminum bottle-shaping technology; \nTotal interest expense was $338 million in 2016 compared to $260 million in 2015 and $193 million in 2014. Excluding debt refinancing and other costs, interest expense in 2016 was higher compared to 2015 as the company incurred additional debt to pay a portion of the cash consideration due to Rexam's shareholders for the Rexam acquisition. Excluding debt refinancing and other costs, interest expense in 2015 was lower compared to 2014 due to lower interest rates on newly issued long-term debt and the retirement of higher interest rate long-term debt. Interest expense, excluding the effect of debt refinancing and other costs, as a percentage of average monthly borrowings was 4 percent in each of the years 2016 and 2015 and 5 percent in 2014.\nAdditional Segment Information\nThe company's share repurchases, net of issuances, totaled $59 million in 2016, $100 million in 2015 and $360 million in 2014. The repurchases were completed using cash on hand and available borrowings and included accelerated share repurchase agreements and other purchases under our ongoing share repurchase program. Additional details about our share repurchase activities are provided in Note 17 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report.\n\nBased on information currently available, we estimate cash flows from operating activities for 2017 to be in the range of $1.3 billion, capital expenditures to be approximately $500 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $800 million. In 2017, we intend to utilize our operating cash flow to service debt and to fund our growth capital projects, dividend payments, stock buybacks and, to the extent available, acquisitions that meet our various criteria. Of the total 2017 estimated capital expenditures, approximately $200 million was contractually committed as of December 31, 2016.\nOur Drive for 10 vision encompasses five strategic levers that are key to growing our business and achieving long-term success. Since launching Drive for 10 in 2011, we made progress on each of the levers as follows:\nThe effective tax rate for 2015 was 14 percent compared to 23 percent in 2014. The decrease in the rate for 2015 was primarily due to a 2.7 percentage point reduction related to the tax effect of statutory foreign exchange losses in our Brazilian operations, a 2.3 percentage point reduction related to the settlement of various uncertain tax positions, a 1.4 percentage point reduction related to the favorable settlement of a prior year IRS audit and a reduction in our rate of 3.0 percentage points due to an increase in U.S. research and development tax credits.\nBusiness consolidation and other activities were $337 million in 2016 compared to $195 million in 2015 and $81million in 2014. These amounts represented 4 percent, 2 percent and 1 percent of consolidated net sales for the three years, respectively.\nContracted backlog for the aerospace segment at December 31, 2016 and 2015, was $1.4 billion and $617 million, respectively. The year-over-year increase reflects several major contract awards during 2016. The segment has numerous outstanding bids for future contract awards. The backlog at December 31, 2016, consisted of 69 percent cost-type contracts. Comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations due to the nature of varying delivery and milestone schedules on contracts, funding of programs and the uncertainty of timing of future contract awards.\nCost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization, was $7,296 million in 2016 compared to $6,460 million in 2015 and $6,903 million in 2014. These amounts represented 81 percent of consolidated net sales for each of these years. Cost of sales in 2016 included expense of $84 million for the step-up of inventory related to the acquired Rexam business.\n(a)Further details of these items are included in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report.\nWhile ongoing financial and economic conditions in certain areas may raise concerns about credit risk with counterparties to derivative transactions, the company mitigates its exposure by allocating the risk among various counterparties and limiting exposure to any one party. We also monitor the credit ratings of our suppliers, customers, lenders and counterparties on a regular basis.\nbusiness. These decreases were partially offset by a gain of $344 million in 2016 recognized on the sale of the Ball legacy portion of the Divestment Business, $173 million lower income tax expense in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the tax impacts of the sale of the Divestment Business, earnings from the increase in net sales from the acquired Rexam business, net of the sale of Ball's legacy portion of the Divestment Business, lower net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests and higher equity in results of affiliates.\nInterest Expense\n(a)Further details of these items are included in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report.\nBall Corporation is one of the world's leading suppliers of metal packaging to the beverage, food, personal care and household products industries. Our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses, are manufactured in facilities around the world and are competitive with other substrates, such as plastics and glass. In the rigid packaging industry, sales and earnings can be increased by reducing costs, increasing prices, developing new products, expanding volumes and making strategic acquisitions. We also provide aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers.\nDuring the third quarter of 2016, Ball made certain segment realignments as a result of the Rexam acquisition and sale of the Divestment Business to align with how Ball now manages its businesses. Ball has retrospectively adjusted prior period amounts to conform to the current segment presentation. Ball's operations are organized and reviewed by management along its product lines and geographical areas and presented in the five reportable segments discussed below.\nComparable operating earnings in 2016 were $105 million higher compared to 2015. The second half of 2016 included earnings from the Rexam business while the second half of 2015 included the company's smaller legacy Brazil business, the significant portion of which was sold with the Divestment Business.\nManagement Performance Measures\nOther Liquidity Measures\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThese ongoing business developments and the successful acquisition of Rexam completed on June 30, 2016, help us stay close to our customers while expanding and/or sustaining our industry positions with major beverage, food, personal care, household products and aerospace customers.\nIn July 2016, $3.8 billion of proceeds released from the restricted cash escrow accounts and amounts drawn under the $1.4 billion Term A loan facility and the \u20ac1.1 billion Term A loan facility were used to pay the cash portion of the consideration due to Rexam's shareholders for the acquisition of Rexam.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nBusiness Overview and Industry Trends\n\nAcquisition of Rexam\nOn March 18, 2016, Ball refinanced the Bridge Facility in full with a $1.4 billion Term A loan facility available to Ball and a \u20ac1.1 billion Term A loan facility available to a subsidiary of Ball. The Term A Loan facilities and 2021 Revolver were entered under a secured, five-year credit agreement.\nThe following financial measurements are on a non-U.S. GAAP basis and should be considered in connection with the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report. Notes 1 and 21 to the company's financial statements included in Item 8 disclose revisions to the company's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the second and third quarters of 2016. The revisions had no impact on the company's non-GAAP measures of comparable operating earnings or comparable net earnings in the second or third quarters of 2016 or for the full year ended December 31, 2016. Non-U.S. GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to, or a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. A presentation of earnings in accordance with U.S. GAAP is available in Item 8 of this annual report.\nWe sell our packaging products mainly to large, multinational beverage, food, personal care and household products companies with which we have developed long-term relationships. This is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of long-term supply contracts. While we have a diversified customer base, we sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major companies in North, Central and South America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa, as do our equity joint ventures in Guatemala, Panama, South Korea, the U.S. and Vietnam. The overall metal container industry is growing globally and is expected to continue to grow in the medium to long term despite the North American industry seeing a continued decline in standard-sized aluminum beverage packaging for the carbonated soft drink market. The primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace segment are U.S. government agencies or their prime contractors.\nCash flows from operations in 2015 were comparable to 2014 as lower pension contributions were offset by lower net earnings, lower cash inflows from working capital and cash paid for transaction costs for the acquisition of Rexam. The working capital changes were primarily related to slightly higher days sales outstanding, partially offset by lower inventory volumes and higher days payable outstanding. Days sales outstanding increased from 34 days to 35 days, inventory days on hand decreased from 52 days to 49 days and days payable outstanding increased from 69 days to 82 days. The increase in days payables outstanding is primarily due to renegotiation of payment terms in supplier contracts in North America.\nWe were in compliance with all loan agreements at December 31, 2016, and all prior years presented, and have met all debt payment obligations. The U.S. note agreements and bank credit agreement contain certain restrictions relating to dividends, investments, financial ratios, guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness. The most restrictive of the company's debt covenants requires the company to maintain a leverage ratio (as defined) of no greater than 5 times on December 31, 2016, which changes to 4 times at December 31, 2017. The company was in compliance with all loan agreements and debt covenants at December 31, 2016, and 2015, and has met all debt payment obligations. As of December 31, 2016, the amounts disclosed as available under the company's long-term multi-currency committed revolving facilities, the short-term uncommitted credit facilities and the unsecured, committed bridge loan agreement, are available without violating our existing debt covenants. Additional details about our debt are available in Note 14 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report.\nAnnual cash dividends paid on common stock were 52 cents per share in each of 2016, 2015 and 2014. Total dividends paid were $83 million in 2016, $72 million in 2015 and $73 million in 2014. We paid dividends to noncontrolling interests of $18 million in 2015 and $12 million in 2014. No dividends were paid to noncontrolling interests in 2016.\nThe company announced on March 2, 2017, that it intends to cease production at its Recklinghausen, Germany, facility only after due negotiation and agreement with the Works Council.\nOVERVIEW\nSegment sales in 2016 were $262 million higher compared to 2015. The second half of 2016 included sales volumes from the Rexam business while the second half of 2015 included the company's legacy European business, the significant portion of which was sold with the Divestment Business.\nWe purchase our raw materials from relatively few suppliers. We also have exposure to inflation, in particular the rising costs of raw materials, as well as other direct cost inputs. We mitigate our exposure to the changes in the costs of metal through the inclusion of provisions in contracts covering the majority of our volumes to pass through metal price changes, as well as through the use of derivative instruments. The pass-through provisions generally result in proportional increases or decreases in sales and costs with a greatly reduced impact, if any, on net earnings. Because of our customer and supplier concentration, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss, insolvency or bankruptcy of a major customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a major customer or supplier, although our contract provisions generally mitigate the risk of customer loss, and our long-term relationships represent a known, stable customer base.\nBased on the above definition, our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows:\nCash flows from operations in 2016 were lower compared to 2015 due to increased operating cash outflows in 2016 due to payments of professional fees and employee costs related to the acquisition of Rexam and sale of the Divestment Business of approximately $325 million; $297 million of additional pension funding, including $171 million related to the acquired Rexam U.K. defined benefit plan; approximately $150 million less cash inflows from working capital due to the sale of the company's legacy European business at its peak working capital requirements; $90 million of payments to settle derivatives associated with the acquired Rexam business; and $50 million of additional interest payments associated with the financing of the Rexam acquisition. Inventory days on hand increased from 49 days to 68 days, days sales outstanding increased from 35 days to 46 days and days payable outstanding increased from 82 days to 97 days. The increase in days outstanding is primarily attributable to the working capital positions of the acquired Rexam operations as compared to the legacy Ball operations included in the Divestment Business.\nThe consummation of the acquisition was subject to, among other things, approval from Ball's shareholders, approval from Rexam's shareholders, certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, all of which were satisfied prior to closing. In order to satisfy certain regulatory requirements, the company was required to sell some of its existing beverage packaging businesses and select beverage can assets of Rexam (the Divestment Business).\nSales in 2016 were $1.1 billion higher compared to 2015 primarily as a result of increased sales of $1.5 billion related to the acquired Rexam business, net of Ball's legacy sales included in the Divestment Business. This increase was partially offset by lower metal input costs passed through to customers of $299 million. Net earnings in 2016 were lower than 2015 primarily due to $142 million higher business consolidation and other activities from increased costs associated with the Rexam acquisition and the sale of the Divestment Business, $167 million of increased depreciation and amortization primarily attributable to depreciation and amortization associated with the acquired Rexam business, recognition in cost of sales of $84 million step-up of inventory related to the acquired Rexam business, higher interest expense of $78 million associated with the net increase in borrowings to fund the cash portion of the purchase price of Rexam and $62 million increased selling, general and administrative costs also due to costs from the acquired Rexam\nBased on changes in return on asset and discount rate assumptions, as well as revisions based on plan experience studies, total pension expense in 2017 is anticipated to be approximately $80 million lower than in 2016 due non-recurring curtailment charge of $80 million in 2016. A reduction of the expected return on pension assets assumption by one quarter of a percentage point would result in an estimated $15 million increase in the 2017 pension expense, while a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate applied to the pension liability would result in an estimated $2 million reduction of pension expense in 2017.\nSales to the U.S. government, either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as a subcontractor, represented 97 percent of segment sales in 2016 compared to 96 percent of segment sales in 2015 and 95 percent in 2014. The aerospace contract mix in 2016 consisted of 55 percent cost-type contracts, which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon and/or earned profit component, and 39 percent fixed-price contracts. The remaining sales were for time and materials contracts.\nManagement internally uses a free cash flow measure to: (1) evaluate the company's liquidity, (2) evaluate strategic investments, (3) plan stock buyback and dividend levels and (4) evaluate the company's ability to incur and service debt. Free cash flow is not a defined term under U.S. GAAP, and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is typically derived directly from the company's consolidated statement of cash flows; however, it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods.\nWe recognize sales under long-term contracts in the aerospace segment using percentage-of-completion under the cost-to-cost method of accounting. Throughout the period of contract performance, we regularly reevaluate and, if necessary, revise our estimates of aerospace total contract revenue, total contract cost and progress toward completion. Because of contract payment schedules, limitations on funding and other contract terms, our sales and accounts receivable for this segment include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed.\nComparable operating earnings in 2016 were $67 million higher compared to 2015 primarily due to the earnings from the acquired Rexam business. Improved product mix from the legacy Ball business also contributed to the favorable year-over-year operating earnings improvement.\n\nDue to the U.S. tax status of certain of Ball's subsidiaries in Canada and the PRC, the company annually provides U.S. taxes on foreign earnings in those subsidiaries, net of any estimated foreign tax credits. Current taxes are also provided on certain other undistributed earnings that are currently taxed in the U.S. Net U.S. taxes provided for Brazil, Canada and PRC earnings in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $21 million, $2 million and $12 million, respectively. Management's intention is to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of Ball's remaining foreign investments and, as a result, no U.S. income or federal withholding tax provision has been made. The indefinite reinvestment assertion is supported by both long-term and short-term forecasts and U.S. financial requirements, including, but not limited to, operating cash flows, capital expenditures, debt maturities and dividends. The company has not provided deferred taxes on earnings in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in its international operations. Retained earnings in non-U.S. subsidiaries were $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2016. It is not practical to estimate the additional taxes that may become payable for the portion of these foreign earnings that have not already been taxed in the U.S.; however, repatriation of these earnings could result in a material increase in the company's income tax liabilities.\nThe 2016 full year effective income tax rate was negative 100.8 percent compared to 13.6 percent for 2015. The lower tax rate in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a 116.0 percentage point reduction for the tax benefit recorded with respect to tax deductible goodwill in a legal entity restructuring in Brazil that was completed in the current year. The tax rate was also reduced by 56.8 percentage points for increased benefits from foreign tax rate differences, primarily due to acquisitions, and by 49.6 percentage points for permanent tax differences on significant current year business dispositions. These amounts were partially offset by a 41.6 percentage point increase for non-deductible transaction costs related to current year acquisitions and a 36.8 percentage point increase for current year increases in valuation allowances, primarily on losses in the U.K.\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $453 million in 2016 compared to $286 million in 2015 and $281 million in 2014. These amounts represented 5 percent, 4 percent and 3 percent of consolidated net sales for those three years, respectively. Depreciation expense was higher in 2016 than in 2015 primarily due to the acquired Rexam fixed assets. Amortization in 2016 included $65 million for the amortization of acquired Rexam intangibles.\nManagement internally uses various measures to evaluate company performance such as return on average invested capital (net operating earnings after tax over the relevant performance period divided by average invested capital over the same period); economic value added (EVA\u00ae) dollars (net operating earnings after tax less a capital charge on average invested capital employed); earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT); earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA); and diluted earnings per share. Management also uses free cash flow (generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures) as a measure to evaluate the company's liquidity. Please refer to the Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources section below for additional information on the company's use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure. We believe this information is also useful to investors as it provides insight into the earnings and cash flow criteria management uses to make strategic decisions. These financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods such as business consolidation costs and gains or losses on acquisitions and dispositions.\nOn June 30, 2016, Ball acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of Rexam, a United Kingdom based beverage container manufacturer, for the purchase price of \u00a32.9 billion ($3.8 billion) in cash, and 32.25 million treasury shares of Ball Corporation common stock (valued at $71.39 per share for a total share consideration of $2.3 billion). The common shares were valued using the price on the date of acquisition and were presented as a reduction of treasury stock. The cash portion of the acquisition price was paid in July 2016 using proceeds from restricted cash held in escrow and borrowings under the $1.4 billion and \u20ac1.1 billion Term A loan facilities obtained in March 2016.\nBeverage Packaging, Europe\nAt December 31, 2016, taking into account outstanding letters of credit, approximately $1.2 billion was available under the company's long-term, multi-currency committed revolving credit facilities, which are available until March 2021. In addition to these facilities, the company had $821 million of short-term uncommitted credit facilities available at December 31, 2016, of which $143 million was outstanding and due on demand. These amounts are available without violating our existing debt covenants. At December 31, 2015, the company had $23 million outstanding under short-term uncommitted credit facilities.\n \u00b7 Maximizing value in our existing businesses by rationalizing standard beverage container and end capacity in North America and expanding specialty container production to meet current demand; leveraging plant floor systems in our beverage facilities to improve efficiencies and reduce costs; consolidating and/or closing multiple beverage and food and aerosol packaging facilities to gain efficiencies; and in food and aerosol packaging segment, installing new extruded aluminum aerosol lines in our existing Devizes, U.K., and Czech Republic facilities while also implementing cost-out and value-in initiatives across all of our businesses; \nThe decreased debt refinancing and other costs in 2016 compared to 2015 included mark-to-market losses on derivative financial instruments designed to mitigate exposure to interest rate changes for debt issuances related to the Rexam acquisition, interest expense on issued 3.5 percent and 4.375 percent senior notes used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Rexam acquisition, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing charges for the partial extinguishment of the committed bridge loan agreement, and the revolving credit facility and amortization of deferred financing costs for the committed bridge loan agreement. See Notes 14 and 20 located in Item 8 of this annual report for additional information on the activity in debt refinancing and other costs.\nSegment sales in 2015 were higher than in 2014 due to favorable price mix variance of $50 million, partially offset by lower sales volume of $35 million. Comparable operating earnings in 2015 were $14 million higher compared to 2014 due primarily to improved manufacturing performance.\nSegment Results\nThe company is routinely subject to litigation incident to operating its businesses, and has been designated by various federal and state environmental agencies as a potentially responsible party, along with numerous other companies, for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites, including in respect of sites related to alleged activities of certain Rexam subsidiaries. The company believes the matters identified will not have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company. Details of the company's legal proceedings are included in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report.\nCost of Sales (Excluding Depreciation and Amortization)\nThe decrease in net sales in 2015 compared to 2014 was due to unfavorable foreign currency effects in Europe, lower metal food container sales volumes due to a customer shift in North American steel food containers and unfavorable pricing in the PRC, partially offset by higher beverage packaging sales volumes. Net earnings were lower in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower sales, unfavorable currency effects, higher business consolidation and other activities and higher debt refinancing and other costs, partially offset by a lower tax rate in 2015 and cost reduction efforts by all business segments.\nSegment sales in 2016 were $126 million lower compared to 2015 as a result of $57 million in lower prices resulting from lower metal costs passed through to customers and $69 million in volume primarily driven by lower food can sales volumes. Comparable operating earnings in 2016 were relatively unchanged compared to 2015 due to improved extruded aluminum sales which offset the decline in food can sales volumes.\n\nBeverage Packaging, North and Central America\nFree Cash Flow\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and external committed borrowings. We believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by short-term, long-term and committed revolver borrowings, when necessary, will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditures. The following summarizes our cash flows:\nSegment sales in 2015 were $207 million lower compared to 2014 due primarily to lower metal food container sales volumes of $260 million, mainly related to a customer shift effective January 2015, and unfavorable currency exchange effects of $37 million, partially offset by favorable product mix of $90 million. The customer shift was the result of the loss of a significant customer upon expiration of their contract in December 2014. The volume reductions were offset by favorable product mix from a higher proportion of aerosol product sales, which is expected to continue. Comparable operating earnings in 2015 decreased $46 million compared to 2014 due primarily to earnings impacts from lower sales volumes, unfavorable currency exchange effects, unfavorable startup costs, partially offset by extruded aluminum aerosol growth in Europe, the earnings from the Sonoco acquisition and reduced selling, general and administrative costs.\nSegment sales in 2016 were $410 million higher compared to 2015. The increase in 2016 was primarily due to the increase in sales volumes of $526 million from the acquired Rexam business partially offset by lower metal input prices of $176 million. We cannot predict future changes in metal input prices and beverage can sales volumes.\nResults of Business Segments\nSegment sales in 2016 were $423 million higher compared to 2015. The second half of 2016 included sales volumes from the Rexam business while the second half of 2015 included the company's smaller legacy Brazil business, the significant portion of which was sold with the Divestment Business.\nThe beverage packaging, Europe, segment includes the manufacture and sale of metal beverage containers in facilities located throughout Europe, including Russia. To support growth for beverage cans in the Iberian Peninsula, the company is constructing a two-line, aluminum beverage can manufacturing facility near Madrid, Spain, with most of the new capacity secured under a long-term customer contract. The facility is expected to be fully operational in 2018 and will produce multiple can sizes.\nTax Provision\n\nFor information regarding the company's critical and significant accounting policies, as well as recent accounting pronouncements, see Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report.\nSegment sales in 2015 were relatively unchanged from 2014 due to higher sales volumes of $63 million partially offset by unfavorable price/mix changes of $60 million. Comparable operating earnings in 2015 were $15 million lower compared to 2014 due primarily to unfavorable manufacturing costs of $86 million partially offset by higher sales volumes and favorable product mix of $74 million.\n\nThe increased debt refinancing and other costs in 2015 compared to 2014 included mark-to-market losses on derivative financial instruments designed to mitigate exposure to interest rates changes for debt issuances related to the Rexam acquisition, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing charges for the partial extinguishment of the committed bridge loan agreement and the revolving credit facility, interest expense on 3.5 percent and 4.375 percent senior notes issued to fund a portion of the purchase price of the Rexam acquisition, amortization of deferred financing costs for the committed bridge loan agreement and the redemption of the 6.75 percent and 5.75 percent senior notes. See Notes 14 and 20 located in Item 8 of this annual report for additional information on financial instruments.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nFor additional information regarding our segments, see the business segment information in Note 3 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report. The charges recorded for business consolidation and other activities were based on estimates by Ball management and were developed from information available at the time. If actual outcomes vary from the estimates, the differences will be reflected in current period earnings in the consolidated statement of earnings and identified as business consolidation gains and losses. Additional details about our business consolidation and other activities are provided in Note 5 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGiven our cash flow projections and unused credit facilities that are available until 2021, our liquidity is strong and is expected to meet our ongoing cash and debt service requirements. Total interest-bearing debt was $7.5 billion at December 31, 2016, compared to $5.1 billion at December 31, 2015.\nThe aerospace segment consists of the manufacture and sale of aerospace and other related products and services provided for the defense, civil space and commercial space industries.\n\n(a) Further details of these items are included in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report.\nDebt refinancing and other costs were $109 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. These costs consisted of (1) interest expense of $49 million through June 30, 2016, on the 3.5 percent and 4.375 percent senior notes issued in December 2015, (2) fair value changes of $20 million on derivative instruments designed to mitigate risks of interest rate changes with debt issuances, (3) interest expense of $30 million through June 30, 2016, on Term A U.S. dollar and Term A euro dollar loans associated with the company's credit facility, and (4) amortization of deferred financing fees of $7 million for the Bridge Facility. See Notes 14 and 20 in Item 8 of this annual report for additional information on these instruments and the transactions flowing through debt refinancing and other costs.\n\n(a)Further details of these items are included in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report.\n \u00b7 Broadening our geographic reach with our acquisition of Rexam and our new investments in a beverage manufacturing facility in Myanmar, as well as an extruded aluminum aerosol manufacturing facility in India, and the construction of a beverage container facility in Monterrey, Mexico, producing cans and ends; and \n(a)Amounts reported in local currencies have been translated at year end 2016 exchange rates.\nCorporate Strategy\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\ninterest rate changes with anticipated debt issuances for a portion of the cash consideration payable in the acquisition of Rexam, (3) write-offs of unamortized deferred financing fees and other charges of $16 million for the partial extinguishment of the committed bridge loan agreement, the partial extinguishment of the revolving credit facility, and refinance of the senior credit facility, (4) the amortization of deferred financing fees of $23 million on the Bridge Facility, and (5) write off of unamortized deferred financing fees and premiums of $57 million for the redemption of previously issued senior notes and the refinance of senior credit facilities. See Notes 14 and 20 in Item 8 of this annual report for additional information on these instruments and the transactions flowing through debt refinancing and other costs.\n \u00b7 Leveraging our technological expertise in packaging innovation, including the introduction of next-generation aluminum bottle-shaping technologies, the introduction of a new two-piece, lightweight steel aerosol can, G3, technology in our Chestnut Hill, Tennessee, facility and the increased production of lightweight ReAlTM containers with 25 percent recycled aluminum content; and investment in cyber and data analytics to further enhance our aerospace technical expertise across a broader customer portfolio. \nThe beverage packaging, North and Central America, segment consists of operations located in the U.S., Canada and Mexico that manufacture aluminum containers used in beverage packaging. During 2016, our beverage manufacturing facility in Monterrey, Mexico, began production. Also, in 2016, our beverage packaging end-making facility in Bristol, Virginia, ceased production.\nCommitments\nBusiness Consolidation Costs and Other Activities\nThe table above does not include $77 million of uncertain tax positions, the timing of which is unknown at this time.\nBased on the above definitions, our calculation of comparable operating earnings is summarized below:\nSegment sales in 2015 decreased $125 million compared to 2014 primarily due to lower sales from U.S. national defense contracts. Comparable operating earnings in 2015 decreased $12 million compared to 2014 due to lower sales, favorable program performance in 2014 from program and contract completions and increased recovery of pension costs in 2014.\nThe beverage packaging, South America, segment consists of operations located in Brazil, Argentina and Chile that manufacture aluminum containers used in beverage packaging.\nComparable operating earnings in 2016 were $25 million higher compared to 2015. The second half of 2016 included earnings from the Rexam business while the second half of 2015 included earnings from the company's legacy European business, the significant portion of which was sold with the Divestment Business.", "item_7_tables": "Table 67: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

</tr>\n</table>", "summary": " This MD&A report discusses Ball Corporation's financial performance and operations in 2016 compared to 2015 and 2014. The key points are:\n\n- Ball completed the acquisition of Rexam PLC, a metal packaging company, in June 2016 for $5.1 billion in cash and stock. This expanded Ball's geographic reach but also resulted in one-time costs like transaction fees and integration expenses. \n\n- Sales in 2016 were $1.1 billion higher than 2015, mostly due to the Rexam acquisition. Net earnings were lower than 2015 due to higher one-time costs related to the Rexam deal, higher depreciation/amortization, and other expenses.\n\n- The food and aerosol packaging segment had lower sales in 2016 due to lower food can volumes. The beverage packaging segments saw sales increases in 2016 from the Rexam acquisition. The aerospace segment had lower sales.\n\n- Operating cash flows were lower in 2016 versus 2015, mostly due to one-time costs related to the Rexam acquisition. Capital expenditures were also higher. \n\n- Ball took on additional debt in 2016 to finance the cash portion of the Rexam acquisition. Total debt increased to $7.5 billion at the end of 2016 from $5.1 billion.\n\n- Ball estimates higher cash flows from operations in 2017 along with lower capital expenditures. It plans to use cash for debt service, growth projects, dividends, buybacks, and acquisitions.\n\nIn summary, Ball expanded its business through the Rexam acquisition in 2016 but experienced higher costs and expenses related to the deal. It expects improved cash flows in 2017."}
