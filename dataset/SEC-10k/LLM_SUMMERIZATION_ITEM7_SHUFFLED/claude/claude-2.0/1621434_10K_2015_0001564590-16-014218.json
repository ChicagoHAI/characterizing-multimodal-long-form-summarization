MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth under Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are one of the largest owners of oil and natural gas mineral interests in the United States. Our principal business is maximizing the value of our existing portfolio of mineral and royalty assets through active management and expanding our asset base through acquisitions of additional mineral and royalty interests. We maximize value through the marketing of our mineral assets for lease, creative structuring of those leases to encourage and accelerate drilling activity, and selectively participating alongside our lessees on a working-interest basis. Our primary business objective is to grow our reserves, production, and cash generated from operations over the long term, while paying, to the extent practicable, a growing quarterly distribution to our unitholders.\nOn May 1, 2015 our common units began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BSM.\u201d On May 6, 2015, we completed our initial public offering of 22,500,000 common units representing limited partner interests.\nOur mineral and royalty interests consist of mineral interests in approximately 14.6 million acres, with an average 47.8% ownership interest in that acreage, NPRIs in 1.3 million acres, and ORRIs in 1.4 million acres. These non-cost-bearing interests include ownership in over 45,000 producing wells. We also own non-operated working interests, a significant portion of which are on positions where we also have a mineral and royalty interest. We recognize oil and natural gas revenue from our mineral and royalty and non-operated working interests in producing wells when the oil and natural gas production from the associated acreage is sold. Our other sources of revenue include mineral lease bonus and delay rentals, which are recognized as revenue according to the terms of the lease agreements.\nRecent Developments\nCommon Unit Repurchase Program\nOn March 4, 2016, the board of directors of our general partner authorized the repurchase of up to $50.0 million in common units over the next six months. The repurchase program authorizes us to make repurchases on a discretionary basis as determined by management, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, available liquidity, and other appropriate factors. All or a portion of any repurchases may be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which would permit common units to be repurchased when we might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws. The repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common units and may be modified or suspended at any time and could be terminated prior to completion. We will periodically report the number of common units repurchased. The repurchase program will be funded from our cash on hand or available revolving credit facility. Any repurchased common units will be cancelled.\nCash Tender Offer\nOn November 6, 2015, we commenced a tender offer to purchase up to 100% of the 117,963 then outstanding preferred units from our preferred unitholders at the units' par value of $1,000.00 per preferred unit, plus unpaid accrued yield. The tender offer expired on December 10, 2015. We purchased and cancelled 40,747 preferred units, representing 34.5% of our then outstanding preferred units. The preferred units were purchased at a purchase price of $1,019.45 per preferred unit for a total cost of approximately $41.5 million, excluding fees and expenses relating to the tender offer.\nAcquisitions\nWe closed five separate transactions to acquire unproved oil and natural gas properties in the Permian Basin during 2015 for a total $51.7 million. We acquired acreage in the Eagle Ford Shale play through two transactions totaling $9.7 million during 2015, and we also acquired an overriding royalty interest in the Utica Shale and Marcellus plays for $1.8 million.\nBusiness Environment\nThe information below is designed to give a broad overview of the oil and natural gas business environment as it affects us.\nCommodity Prices\nOil and natural gas prices have been historically volatile based upon the dynamics of supply and demand. During 2015, oil and natural gas prices have remained significantly below prices seen over the past five years as global concerns of long-term supply imbalances and slowing demand growth have continued to weigh on prices. West Texas Intermediate ( WTI\u201d) spot prices ranged from a low of $34.55 per Bbl on December 21, 2015 to a high of $61.36 per Bbl on June 10, 2015. Oil prices have continued to be pressured downward following the end of the year, reaching a low of $26.19 per Bbl on February 11, 2016. During 2015, Henry Hub spot natural gas prices ranged from a low of $1.63 per MMBtu on December 23, 2015 to a high of $3.32 per MMBtu on January 15, 2015. The Henry Hub spot price closed at $1.62 per MMBtu on February 29, 2016. To manage the variability in cash flows associated with the projected sale of our oil and natural gas production, we use various derivative instruments, which have generally consisted of fixed-price swaps and costless collars.\nThe following table reflects commodity prices at the end of each of the four quarters for the most recently completed fiscal year:\nTable 187: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Benchmark Prices\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> First\nQuarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Second\nQuarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Third\nQuarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fourth\nQuarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> WTI spot oil price ($/Bbl)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 47.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 59.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45.06\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Henry Hub spot natural gas ($/MMBtu)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.65\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSource: EIA\nRig Count\nSince we are not an operator, drilling on our acreage is dependent upon the exploration and production companies that lease our acreage. In addition to drilling plans that we seek from our operators, we monitor rig counts in an effort to identify existing and future leasing and drilling activity on our acreage.\nThe following table shows the rig count at the end of each of the four quarters for the most recently completed fiscal year:\nTable 188: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. Rotary Rig Count\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> First\nQuarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Second\nQuarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Third\nQuarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fourth\nQuarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Oil\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Natural gas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSource: Baker Hughes Incorporated\nNatural Gas Storage\nA substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sales of oil production attributable to our interests; however, the majority of our production is natural gas. Natural gas prices are significantly influenced by storage levels throughout the year. Accordingly, we monitor the natural gas storage reports regularly in the evaluation of our business and its outlook.\nHistorically, natural gas supply and demand fluctuates on a seasonal basis. From April to October, when the weather is warmer and natural gas demand is lower, natural gas storage levels generally increase. From November to March, storage levels typically decline as utility companies draw natural gas from storage to meet increased heating demand due to colder weather. In order to maintain sufficient storage levels for increased seasonal demand, a portion of natural gas production during the summer months must be used for storage injection. The portion of production used for storage varies from year to year depending on the demand from the previous winter and the demand for electricity used for cooling during the summer months.\nThe following table shows natural gas storage volumes by region at the end of each of the four quarters for the most recently completed fiscal year:\nTable 189: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Region\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> First\nQuarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Second\nQuarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Third\nQuarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fourth\nQuarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Bcf)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> East\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Midwest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mountain\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pacific\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> South Central\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,756\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSource: EIA\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nWe use a variety of operational and financial measures to assess our performance. Among the measures considered by management are the following:\nTable 190: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> volumes of oil and natural gas produced;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> commodity prices including the effect of hedges; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 192: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and cash available for distribution.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nVolumes of Oil and Natural Gas Produced\nIn order to assess and track the performance of our assets, we monitor and analyze production volumes from the various basins and plays that comprise our extensive asset base. We also regularly compare projected volumes to actual reported volumes and investigate unexpected variations.\nCommodity Prices\nFactors Affecting the Sales Price of Oil and Natural Gas\nThe prices we receive for oil, natural gas, and NGLs vary by geographical area. The relative prices of these products are determined by the factors affecting global and regional supply and demand dynamics, such as economic conditions, production levels, availability of transportation, weather cycles, and other factors. In addition, realized prices are influenced by product quality and proximity to consuming and refining markets. Any differences between realized prices and NYMEX prices are referred to as differentials. All of our production is derived from properties located in the United States. As a result of our geographic diversification, we are not exposed to concentrated differential risks associated with any single play, trend, or basin.\nTable 193: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Oil. The substantial majority of our oil production is sold at prevailing market prices, which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of our control. NYMEX light sweet crude oil, commonly referred to as WTI, is the prevailing domestic oil pricing index. The majority of our oil production is priced at the prevailing market price with the final realized price affected by both quality and location differentials.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe chemical composition of crude oil plays an important role in its refining and subsequent sale as petroleum products. As a result, variations in chemical composition relative to the benchmark crude oil, usually WTI, will result in price adjustments, which are often referred to as quality differentials. The characteristics that most significantly affect quality differentials include the density of the oil, as characterized by its API gravity, and the presence and concentration of impurities, such as sulfur.\nLocation differentials generally result from transportation costs based on the produced oil's proximity to consuming and refining markets and major trading points.\nTable 194: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Natural Gas. The NYMEX price quoted at Henry Hub is a widely used benchmark for the pricing of natural gas in the United States. The actual volumetric prices realized from the sale of natural gas differ from the quoted NYMEX price as a result of quality and location differentials.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nQuality differentials result from the heating value of natural gas measured in Btus and the presence of impurities, such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen. Natural gas containing ethane and heavier hydrocarbons has a higher Btu value and will realize a higher volumetric price than natural gas made up of predominantly methane, which has a lower Btu value. Natural gas with a higher concentration of impurities will realize a lower volumetric price due to the presence of the impurities in the natural gas when sold or the cost of treating the natural gas to meet pipeline quality specifications.\nNatural gas, which currently has a limited global transportation system, is subject to price variances based on local supply and demand conditions and the cost to transport natural gas to end user markets.\nHedging\nWe enter into derivative instruments to partially mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility on our cash generated from operations. From time to time, such instruments may include fixed-price swaps, costless collars, fixed-price contracts, and other contractual arrangements. We currently employ a rolling hedge\u201d strategy whereby we hedge a significant portion of our proved developed producing reserves 18 to 24 months into the future. The impact of these derivative instruments could affect the amount of revenue we ultimately realize. Throughout 2014, we entered into costless collars to allow us the ability to participate in upward movements in commodity prices while also setting a price floor for a portion of our production. Costless collars are a combination of a purchased put option and a sold call option, in which the premiums paid and received net to zero. During the fourth quarter of 2014 and all of 2015, we also entered into fixed-price swap contracts. Under fixed-price swap contracts, a counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is less than the swap strike price; conversely, we are required to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is greater than the swap strike price. We may employ contractual arrangements other than costless collars and fixed-price swap contracts in the future to mitigate the impact of price fluctuations. If commodity prices decline in the future, our hedging contracts will partially mitigate the effect of lower prices on our future revenue.\nOur open oil and natural gas derivative contracts as of December 31, 2015 are detailed in Note 5 - Derivatives and Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Our credit facility agreement limits the extent to which we can hedge our future production. Under the terms of our credit facility agreement, we are able to hedge estimated production from our proved developed producing reserves based on our most recently completed reserve report provided to our lenders. We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes. Including derivative contracts entered into subsequent to December 31, 2015, we have hedged 91.7%, and 44.2% of our estimated oil and condensate production and 92.5%, and 46.5% of our estimated natural gas production from our proved developed producing reserves for 2016 and 2017, respectively.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and cash available for distribution are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures used by our management and external users of our financial statements such as investors, research analysts, and others, to assess the financial performance of our assets and our ability to sustain distributions over the long term without regard to financing methods, capital structure, or historical cost basis.\nWe define EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, income taxes and depreciation, depletion, and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for impairment of oil and natural gas properties, accretion of ARO, unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments, and non-cash equity-based compensation. We define cash available for distribution as Adjusted EBITDA plus or minus amounts for certain non-cash operating activities, borrowings for capital expenditures, capital expenditures, cash interest expense, and distributions to noncontrolling interests and preferred unitholders.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and cash available for distribution should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, cash flows from operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP as measures of our financial performance. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and cash available for distribution have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Our computation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and cash available for distribution may differ from computations of similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and cash available for distribution to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the periods indicated.\nTable 195: <table> <tr>

These incremental expenses include costs associated with SEC reporting requirements, including annual and quarterly reports to unitholders; tax return and Schedule K-1 preparation and distribution; Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance; New York Stock Exchange listing fees; independent registered public accounting firm fees; legal fees, investor-relations activities, registrar and transfer agent fees; director-and-officer insurance; and additional compensation. These direct, incremental general and administrative expenses are not included in our historical results of operations for periods prior to our IPO.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31,

mineral-and-royalty-interest owner, we are often provided insufficient and inconsistent data by our operators. As a result, we are unable to reliably determine the total volumes of NGLs associated with the production of natural gas on our acreage. As such, the realized prices account for all sales attributable to NGLs. The oil and condensate production volumes and natural gas production volumes do not include NGL volumes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nThe decrease in total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to a decrease of $228.9 million from lower realized commodity prices and $23.1 million of reduced lease bonus activity, partially offset by $52.9 million of gains attributable to commodity derivative instruments and $43.6 million related to higher oil and condensate production volumes.\nOil and condensate sales. Oil and condensate sales during 2015 were lower than the corresponding period in 2014 primarily due to a steep decline in realized prices. Our mineral-and-royalty-interest oil volumes accounted for 76.8% and 74.7% of total oil and condensate volumes for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the year ended December 31, 2014, respectively. Our mineral-and-royalty-interest oil volumes increased in 2015 relative to 2014 primarily driven by production increases from new wells in the Bakken/Three Forks and Eagle Ford plays. Our working-interest oil and condensate volumes increased during 2015 versus 2014 primarily due to volumes added from new wells in the Bakken/Three Forks and Wilcox plays.\nNatural gas and natural gas liquids sales. Natural gas revenues decreased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014. A significant decline in the realized natural gas and NGL prices for the year ended December 31, 2015 versus the corresponding period in 2014 was primarily responsible for the decrease in our natural gas and NGL revenues. Mineral-and-royalty-\ninterest production made up 67.3% and 67.8% of our natural gas volumes for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nGain on commodity derivative instruments. In 2015, we recognized $57.7 million of gains from oil commodity contracts, of which $15.9 million were realized, compared to $27.5 million of combined gains in 2014, virtually all of which were unrealized. In 2015, we recognized $32.6 million of gains from natural gas commodity contracts, of which $11.2 million were unrealized, compared to $9.8 million of net gains in 2014, of which $11.8 million were unrealized gains.\nLease bonus and other income. Lease bonus and delay rental revenue decreased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014. In 2014, we successfully closed several large leases in the Canyon Lime and Canyon Wash plays in north Texas, the Permian Basin in west Texas, the Austin Chalk and Woodbine play in east Texas, the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale play in Mississippi and the Bakken play in North Dakota. While we closed large lease transactions in 2015 in the Wolfcamp, the Eagle Ford Shale, various plays in East Texas and in Southern Mississippi, the total number of leases was down significantly from 2014.\nOperating Expenses\nLease operating expenses. Lease operating expense includes normally recurring expenses necessary to produce hydrocarbons from our non-operated working interests in oil and natural gas wells, as well as certain nonrecurring expenses, such as well repairs. Lease operating expense increased slightly for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to higher oil and condensate production.\nProduction costs and ad valorem taxes. Production taxes include statutory amounts deducted from our production revenues by various state taxing entities. Depending on the regulations of the states where the production originates, these taxes may be based on a percentage of the realized value or a fixed amount per production unit. This category also includes the costs to process and transport our production to applicable sales points. Ad valorem taxes are jurisdictional taxes levied on the value of oil and natural gas minerals and reserves. Rates, methods of calculating property values, and timing of payments vary between taxing authorities. For the year ended December 31, 2015, production and ad valorem taxes decreased over the year ended December 31, 2014, generally as a result of lower realized commodity prices and estimated mineral reserve valuations.\nExploration expense. Exploration expense typically consists of dry-hole expenses and geological and geophysical costs, including seismic costs, and is expensed as incurred under the successful efforts method of accounting. Exploration expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased from the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to costs incurred to acquire 3-D seismic information related to our mineral and royalty interests from a third-party service provider.\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization. Depletion is the amount of cost basis of oil and natural gas properties attributable to the volume of hydrocarbons extracted during such period, calculated on a units-of-production basis. Estimates of proved developed producing reserves are a major component of the calculation of depletion. We adjust our depletion rates semi-annually based upon the mid-year and year-end reserve reports, except when circumstances indicate that there has been a significant change in reserves or costs. Depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense decreased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to higher production rates offset by the impact of a reduced cost basis resulting from impairment charges related to prior periods.\nImpairment of oil and natural gas properties. Individual categories of oil and natural gas properties are assessed periodically to determine if the net book value for these properties has been impaired. Management periodically conducts an in-depth evaluation of the cost of property acquisitions, successful exploratory wells, development activities, unproved leasehold, and mineral interests to identify impairments. Impairments for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 primarily resulted from changes in reserve values due to declines in future expected realized net cash flows as a result of lower commodity prices.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses are costs not directly associated with the production of oil and natural gas and include the cost of employee salaries and related benefits, office expenses, and fees for professional services. For the year ended December 31, 2015, general and administrative expenses increased compared to 2014. In 2015, personnel costs and costs attributable to our long-term incentive plans were $12.3 million higher primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation awards granted subsequent to our IPO and certain restructuring costs. We also incurred an additional $2.5 million for our Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance project and other consulting work during 2015.\nInterest expense. Interest expense decreased due to lower average outstanding borrowing under our credit facility. Outstanding borrowings during 2015 were lower than 2014, primarily due to payments made towards the outstanding balance of our credit facility with proceeds from our IPO.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014

often provided insufficient and inconsistent data by our operators. As a result, we are unable to reliably determine the total volumes of NGLs associated with the production of natural gas on our acreage. As such, the realized prices account for all sales attributable to NGLs. The oil and condensate production volumes and natural gas production volumes do not include NGL volumes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nTotal revenue. The increase in total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 was made up of $43.2 million from commodity derivative instruments, $23.8 million resulting from higher production volumes, $14.3 million from higher lease bonus, and $3.4 million from higher realized commodity prices.\nOil and condensate sales. Oil and condensate sales during the period were higher than the corresponding period in 2013 primarily due to an increase in production volumes. Our mineral-and-royalty-interest oil volumes accounted for 74.7% and 73.7% of total oil and condensate volumes for the year ended December 31, 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2013, respectively. The 16.1% increase in mineral-and-royalty-interest oil volumes, in 2014 relative to 2013 was driven primarily by production increases from new wells in the Eagle Ford Shale. Our working-interest oil volumes increased by 9.8% during 2014 versus 2013 primarily due to volumes added from new wells in the Bakken/Three Forks plays. The decrease in realized oil prices partially offset the impact on revenues from the increase in oil and condensate production.\nNatural gas and natural gas liquids sales. An increase in the realized natural gas price for the twelve months of 2014 versus the same period in 2013 was responsible for the growth in our natural gas revenues. The favorable price variance was partially offset by a decrease in produced volumes. As we expected, natural gas production declined from period to period. The decline in both mineral-and-royalty-interest and working-interest volumes was primarily driven by the run-off in production in the Hayneville/Bossier Shale\nplays. In 2008 and 2009, we entered into lease agreements which covered the majority of our Hayneville/Bossier Shale acreage in Louisiana and Texas. As operators drilled wells to hold acreage, our natural gas production increased significantly in the plays, with volumes peaking in 2012. With most acreage now held by production, many operators have moved drilling rigs out of the plays. Although these wells initially produce at high rates, they tend to decline rapidly. Without consistent drilling activity to replace the high decline rates of the individual wells, the overall production rate from the plays has declined. While operators have recently begun to increase the drilling activity on our acreage, production from these new wells has not yet reached the point of offsetting declines in existing wells. Mineral-and-royalty-interest production made up 67.8% and 62.7% of our natural gas volumes for the period ending December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nGain (loss) on commodity derivative instruments. In 2014, global oil inventories increased to the largest level since 2008. Supply and demand imbalances caused oil prices to decline sharply during the latter half of the year. In addition, robust domestic natural gas production coupled with a warmer than normal winter contributed to lower than average natural gas storage withdrawals. Natural gas prices reflected the abundant supplies. We used derivative instruments to mitigate the risk and resulting impact of such volatility. In 2014, we recognized $27.5 million of combined gains from oil commodity contracts, virtually all of which were unrealized, compared to $3.5 million of combined losses in 2013. In 2014, we recognized $9.8 million of net gains from natural gas commodity contracts, of which $11.8 million were unrealized, compared to $2.4 million of net losses in 2013.\nLease bonus and other income. The increase in lease bonus and other income for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013 was primarily due to the successful closing of several significant leases in the Canyon Lime and Canyon Wash plays in north Texas and the Permian Basin during 2014.\nOperating Expenses\nLease operating expense. Lease operating expense was substantially consistent between periods.\nProduction costs and ad valorem taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2014, production and ad valorem taxes increased over the year ended December 31, 2013 as a result of higher oil and natural gas sales.\nExploration expense. Exploration expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased from the same period in 2013 due to costs related to a dry hole that was drilled during 2014.\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization. Depreciation, depletion, and amortization increased primarily due to an increase in our overall average depletion rate by field. The average depletion rate increased because of downward reserve revisions, which resulted from adjustments to estimates made by NSAI for projected lease operating expenses and natural gas shrinkage. In addition, during the second half of 2014, we experienced higher depletion expense for certain working-interest wells due to rapidly declining reservoir characteristics. Lower natural gas production volumes served to partially mitigate this increase in depletion rates.\nImpairment of oil and natural gas properties. Impairments totaled $117.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to changes in reserve values resulting from the drop in commodity prices and other factors. Impairments totaled $57.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to the impact that changes in price had on the value of our reserve estimates.\nGeneral and administrative. For the year ended December 31, 2014, general and administrative expenses increased as compared to 2013 primarily due to higher personnel costs and costs attributable to our long-term incentive plans. While our overall general and administrative expenses increased for 2014, our 2014 legal and broker fees were lower due to nonrecurring costs incurred to consummate our 2013 exchange offer and a one-time acquisition-related broker fee payment incurred in the prior period.\nInterest expense. Interest expense increased due to additional borrowings under our credit facility. Outstanding borrowings during 2014 were higher than 2013, primarily due to increased expenditures for acquisitions, drilling activity, and common equity repurchases during 2013.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations, borrowings under our credit facility, and proceeds from any future issuances of equity and debt. Our primary uses of cash are for distributions to our unitholders and for investing in our\nbusiness, specifically the acquisition of mineral-and-royalty and working interests and the development of our oil and natural gas properties.\nThe board of directors of our general partner has adopted a policy pursuant to which distributions equal in amount to the applicable minimum quarterly distribution will be paid on each common and subordinated unit for each quarter to the extent we have sufficient cash generated from our operations after establishment of cash reserves, if any, and after we have made the required distributions to the holders of our outstanding preferred units. However, we do not have a legal or contractual obligation to pay distributions quarterly or on any other basis, at the applicable minimum quarterly distribution rate or at any other rate, and there is no guarantee that we will pay distributions to our unitholders in any quarter. Our minimum quarterly distribution provides the common unitholders a specified priority right to distributions over the subordinated unitholders. The board of directors of our general partner may change the foregoing distribution policy at any time and from time to time.\nWe intend to finance our future acquisitions and working-interest capital needs with cash generated from operations, borrowings from our credit facility, and proceeds from any future issuances of equity and debt. Replacement capital expenditures are expenditures necessary to replace our existing oil and natural gas reserves or otherwise maintain our asset base over the long-term. Like a number of other master limited partnerships, we are required by our partnership agreement to retain cash from our operations in an amount equal to our estimated replacement capital requirements. We have set our distribution rate at a level we believe will allow us to retain in our business sufficient cash generated from our operations to satisfy our replacement capital expenditures needs and to fund a portion of our growth capital expenditures. The board of directors of our general partner is responsible for establishing the amount of our estimated replacement capital expenditures.\nCash Flows\nThe following table shows our cash flows for the periods presented:\nTable 200: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 284,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 396,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 320,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (90,998\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (101,110\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (195,631\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows used in financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (195,307\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (310,335\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (142,311\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nOperating Activities. Our operating cash flow is dependent, in large part, on our production, realized commodity prices, leasing revenues, and operating expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2015, cash flows from operating activities decreased by $111.4 million. This decrease was primarily due to lower cash collections of $190.0 million related to oil and natural gas sales and lease bonus revenue as compared to 2014; the impact of $65.2 million in higher cash collections related to the settlement of commodity derivative instruments partially offset the decrease resulting from lower oil and natural gas sales and lease bonus.\nInvesting Activities. The net cash used in investing activities decreased by $10.1 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to a reduction of $26.2 million in capital expenditures for our working interests, net of proceeds from the sales of oil and natural gas properties and a contractual termination payment related to a leasehold prospect. An increase of $16.7 million spent on acquisitions partially offset the overall decrease in net cash used in investing activities.\nFinancing Activities. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the net cash used in financing activities decreased $115.0 million compared to 2014. During 2015, we used net proceeds from our IPO to repay substantially all of our outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility. The proceeds received in excess of our net repayments resulted in a decrease in net cash used in financing activities from 2014. Monies borrowed to fund a $41.5 million cash tender offer for our preferred units plus unpaid accrued yield partially offset the overall decrease in net cash used in financing activities.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nOperating Activities. For the year ended December 31, 2014, cash flows from operating activities increased by $75.4 million as compared to the same period in 2013 due to increased realized natural gas prices, higher oil and condensate volumes, and higher lease bonus revenue.\nInvesting Activities. The net cash used in investing activities decreased by $94.5 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to reduced capital spent on acquisitions and lower capital expenditures under our working-interest participation program. For the\nyear ended December 31, 2014, our cash expenditures for acquisitions totaled $45.6 million versus $121.6 million for the same period in 2013. Capital expenditures for our working interests, net of sale proceeds, decreased by $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 versus the comparable period of 2013.\nFinancing Activities. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the net cash used in financing activities increased $168.0 million compared to the same period in 2013. During 2014, we made distributions to unitholders of $224.9 million, distributions on redeemable preferred units of $15.7 million, $57.0 million of credit facility repayments, and equity repurchases of $5.2 million, and we paid $7.6 million of consulting and other costs directly related to our initial public offering. During 2013, we received $191.6 million in equity contributions as a result of our exchange offer and borrowed $134.0 million under our credit facility. These activities were partially offset by distributions to unitholders of $225.7 million, distributions on redeemable preferred units of $15.7 million, equity repurchases of $118.1 million, repayments under our credit facility of $46.1 million, and purchases of noncontrolling interests of $60.7 million. Please read the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our exchange and equity offerings.\nCapital Expenditures\nAt the beginning of each calendar year, we establish a capital budget and then monitor it throughout the year. Our capital budgets are created based upon our estimate of internally generated cash flows and the ability to borrow and raise additional capital. Actual capital expenditure levels will vary, in part, based on actual internally generated cash, actual wells proposed by our operators for our participation, and the successful closing of acquisitions. The timing, size, and nature of acquisitions are unpredictable.\nDuring 2015, we spent approximately $63.2 million on eight acquisitions. We also incurred approximately $60.1 million related to drilling and completion costs, the majority of which was in the Haynesville/Bossier, Bakken/Three Forks, and Wilcox plays. Our 2016 capital budget for drilling expenditures is approximately $60.0 million. Approximately 95% of our drilling capital budget will be spent in the Haynesville/Bossier and Bakken/Three Forks plays, respectively, with the remainder spent in various plays including the Wolfcamp and Wilcox plays.\nDuring 2014, we spent $45.6 million on three cash acquisitions and completed another acquisition for $2.3 million with an issuance of equity securities. In 2014, we spent approximately $67.7 million on drilling and completion costs.\nCredit Facility\nOn January 23, 2015, we amended and restated our $1.0 billion senior secured revolving credit agreement. Under this third amended and restated credit facility, the commitment of the lenders equals the lesser of the aggregate maximum credit amounts of the lenders or the borrowing base, which is determined based on the lenders' estimated value of our oil and natural gas properties. On October 28, 2015, the third amended and restated credit facility was further amended to extend the term of the agreement from February 3, 2017 to February 4, 2019. Borrowings under the third amended and restated credit facility may be used for the acquisition of properties, cash distributions, and other general corporate purposes. Our semi-annual borrowing base redetermination process resulted in a decrease of the borrowing base from $600.0 million to $550.0 million, effective October 28, 2015. Our next borrowing base redetermination is scheduled for April 2016. As of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding borrowings of $66.0 million at a weighted-average interest rate of 1.92%. We used net proceeds from our IPO in May 2015 to repay substantially all indebtedness then outstanding under our third amended and restated credit facility.\nThe borrowing base under the third amended and restated credit agreement is redetermined semi-annually, on April 1 and October 1 of each year, by the administrative agent, taking into consideration the estimated loan value of our oil and natural gas properties consistent with the administrative agent's normal oil and natural gas lending criteria. The administrative agent's proposed redetermined borrowing base must be approved by all lenders to increase our existing borrowing base, and by two-thirds of the lenders to maintain or decrease our existing borrowing base. In addition, we and the lenders (at the election of two-thirds of the lenders) each have discretion once in between scheduled redeterminations, to have the borrowing base redetermined.\nOutstanding borrowings under the third amended and restated credit facility bear interest at a floating rate elected by us equal to an alternative base rate (which is equal to the greatest of the Prime rate, the Federal Funds effective rate plus 0.5%, or 1-month LIBOR plus 1.0%) or LIBOR, in each case plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin ranges from 0.50% to 1.50% in the case of the alternative base rate and from 1.50% to 2.50% in the case of LIBOR, in each case depending on the amount of borrowings outstanding in relation to the borrowing base. We are obligated to pay a quarterly commitment fee ranging from 0.375% to 0.500% per year on the unused portion of the borrowing base, depending on the amount of the borrowings outstanding in relation to the borrowing base. Principal may be optionally repaid from time to time without premium or penalty, other than customary LIBOR breakage, and is required to be paid (a) if the amount outstanding exceeds the borrowing base, whether due to a borrowing base redetermination or otherwise, in some cases subject to a cure period or (b) at the maturity date. The third amended and restated credit facility is secured by liens on substantially all of our properties.\nThe third amended and restated credit agreement contains various affirmative, negative, and financial maintenance covenants. These covenants, among other things, limit additional indebtedness, additional liens, sales of assets, mergers and consolidations, dividends and distributions, transactions with affiliates and entering into certain swap agreements, as well as require the maintenance of certain financial ratios. The third amended and restated credit agreement contains two financial covenants: total debt to EBITDAX of 3.5:1.0 or less; and a modified current ratio of 1.0:1.0 or greater. Distributions are not permitted if there is a default under the third amended and restated credit agreement (including due to a failure to satisfy one of the financial covenants) or during any time that our borrowing base is lower than the loans outstanding under the third amended and restated credit facility. The lenders have the right to accelerate all of the indebtedness under the third amended and restated credit facility upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any event of default, and the third amended and restated credit agreement contains customary events of default, including non-payment, breach of covenants, materially incorrect representations, cross-default, bankruptcy, and change of control. There are no cure periods for events of default due to non-payment of principal and breaches of negative and financial covenants, but non-payment of interest and breaches of certain affirmative covenants are subject to customary cure periods. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our minimum payments as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 201: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less Than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More Than 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit facility\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 66,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 66,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 71,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 66,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2015, we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Related Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of our accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. The following discussions of critical accounting estimates, including any related discussion of contingencies, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions could be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. We have provided expanded discussion of our more significant accounting estimates below.\nPlease read the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our accounting policies.\nSuccessful Efforts Method of Accounting\nWe use the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and natural gas operations. Under this method, costs to acquire interests in oil and natural gas properties are capitalized. The cost of property acquisitions, successful exploratory wells, development costs, and support equipment and facilities are initially capitalized when incurred. DD&A of producing oil and natural gas properties is recorded based on a units-of-production methodology. Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized on the basis of all proved reserves, developed and undeveloped, and capitalized development costs are amortized on the basis of proved developed reserves. Proved reserves are quantities of oil and natural gas that can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. A sustained low price environment could decrease our estimate of proved reserves, which would increase the rate at which we record depletion expense and reduce net income. Additionally, a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our assessment of producing properties for impairment. We are unable to predict future commodity prices with any greater precision than the futures market. The impact of commodity prices can be illustrated as follows. If we assumed the average 12-month forward strip pricing as of December 31, 2015 was held constant in determining our reserves, our estimated proved reserves on a Boe basis as of December 31, 2015 would have declined by approximately 2%.\nOther exploratory costs, including annual delay rentals and geological and geophysical costs, are expensed when incurred. Mineral and royalty interests and working interests are recorded at cost at the time of acquisition. Upon sale or retirement of depreciable or depletable property, the cost and related accumulated DD&A are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is recognized.\nThe costs of unproved leaseholds and mineral interests are capitalized as unproved properties pending the results of exploration efforts. As unproved leaseholds are determined to be proved, the related costs are transferred to proved properties. Unproved and non-producing property costs are assessed periodically, on a property-by-property basis, and an impairment loss is recognized to the extent, if any, the recorded value has been impaired. Mineral interests are recorded at cost at the time of acquisition. Mineral interests are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. This assessment is performed by comparing carrying values to valuation estimates and impairment is recognized to the extent that book value exceeds estimated recoverable value. Any impairment will generally be based on geographic or geologic data and our estimated future cash flows related to our properties.\nWe evaluate impairment of producing properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We estimate the undiscounted future cash flows expected in connection with the properties and compare such undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable. When the carrying amount of a property exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, the carrying amount is reduced to its fair value. Fair value is calculated as the present value of estimated future discounted cash flows of such properties. The factors used to determine fair value include estimates of proved reserves, future commodity prices, timing of future production, future capital expenditures, and a risk-adjusted discount rate. The markets for oil and natural gas have a history of significant price volatility. However, a sustained low price environment could result in lower NYMEX forward strip prices and lower estimates of future cash flows expected from our properties. Such decrease in cash flow estimates could result in recording additional impairment for our properties if such circumstances indicated the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nUnder various contracts, permits, and regulations, we have legal obligations to restore the land at the end of operations at certain properties where we own non-operated working interests. Estimating the future restoration costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult. Most of these restoration obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what practices and criteria must be met when the event actually occurs. Asset-restoration technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into the valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change.\nFair values of legal obligations to retire and remove long-lived assets are recorded when the obligation is incurred and becomes determinable. When the liability is initially recorded, we capitalize this cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related property and equipment. Over time, the liability is accreted for the change in its present value, and the capitalized cost in oil and natural gas properties is depleted based on units of production consistent with the related asset.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. Revenues are considered realized or realizable and earned when: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. We recognize oil and natural gas revenue from our interests in producing wells when the associated production is sold. To the extent actual volumes and prices of oil and natural gas are unavailable for a given reporting period because of timing or information not received from third parties, the expected sales volume and prices for these properties are estimated and recorded within accounts receivable. Crude oil is priced on the delivery date based upon prevailing prices published by purchasers with certain adjustments related to oil quality and physical location. Natural gas contracts' pricing provisions are tied to a market index, with certain adjustments based on, among other factors, whether a well delivers to a gathering or transmission line, quality and heat content of natural gas, and prevailing supply and demand conditions, so that the price of natural gas fluctuates to remain competitive with other available natural gas supplies. These market indices are determined on a monthly basis.\nOur other sources of revenue include mineral lease bonus and delay rentals, which are recognized as revenue according to the terms of the lease agreements. We generate lease bonus revenue from leasing our mineral interests to exploration and production companies. The lease agreements transfer the rights to any oil or natural gas discovered to the operators, grant us a right to a specified royalty interest, and require that drilling and completion operations be done within a specified time period. We recognize such lease bonus revenue at which time the lease agreement has been executed, payment is determined to be collectable, and we have no further\nobligation to refund the payment. We also recognize revenue from delay rentals to the extent drilling has not started within the specified period, payment has been collected, and we have no further obligation to refund the payment.\nDerivatives and Financial Instruments\nOur ongoing operations expose us to changes in the market price for oil and natural gas. To mitigate the given commodity price risk associated with its operations, we use derivative instruments. From time to time, such instruments may include fixed-price contracts, variable to fixed price swaps, costless collars, and other contractual arrangements. We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes. In addition, we currently employ a rolling hedge\u201d strategy whereby we generally hedge our proved developed producing reserves 18 to 24 months into the future. The impact of these derivative instruments could affect the amount of revenue we ultimately record.\nDerivative instruments are recognized at fair value. If a right of offset exists under master netting arrangements and certain other criteria are met, derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are netted on the consolidated balance sheet. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized on a net basis in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations within gain (loss) on commodity derivative instruments. Although these derivative instruments may expose us to credit risk, we monitor the creditworthiness of our counterparties.\nEquity-Based Compensation\nWe recognize equity-based compensation expense for unit-based awards granted to our employees and the board of directors of our general partner. Total compensation expense for unit-based awards is calculated based on the number of units granted multiplied by the grant-date fair value per unit. Compensation expense for time-based restricted unit awards with graded vesting requirements are recognized using straight-line attribution over the requisite service period. Compensation expense related to the restricted performance unit awards is determined by multiplying the number of common units underlying such awards that, based on our estimates, are likely to vest, by the grant-date fair value and recognized using the accelerated attribution method. Equity-based compensation expense related to unit-based awards is included in general and administrative expense within the consolidated statements of operations. Distribution equivalent rights for the restricted performance unit awards that are expected to vest are charged to partners' capital. Please read Note 10 - Incentive Compensation within the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information.\nPrior to our initial public offering, the board of directors of our Predecessor determined the fair value of unit-based awards by considering various objective and subjective factors, along with input from management, and using the same methodology as required under our Predecessor's partnership agreement for purposes of repurchasing Predecessor common units from those limited partners who exercise their right to annually sell a portion of their units. To determine the fair value of the unit-based awards, the board of directors of our Predecessor considered information provided by third-party consultants and relied on generally accepted valuation techniques, which included the net asset value method under the asset approach, the guideline public company method under the market approach, and the dividend discount method of the income approach. Estimates of value using the net asset value method were derived using assumptions including commodity prices, estimated development timing of our acreage, and market-based discount rates. The value conclusion using the guideline public company method was estimated by considering peer company performance metrics, comparability of the peer company portfolio and risk profiles, and implied forward distribution yields and multiples. To estimate the value of the awards using the transaction method, publicly available data related to acquisitions of mineral properties and applied the implied deal metrics to our performance measures were reviewed. The dividend discount method was developed based on assumptions including our projected distributions, anticipated long-term distribution growth rates, and near- and long-term cost of capital estimates.

Our operating cash flow is dependent, in large part, on our production, realized commodity prices, leasing revenues, and operating expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2015, cash flows from operating activities decreased by $111.4 million. This decrease was primarily due to lower cash collections of $190.0 million related to oil and natural gas sales and lease bonus revenue as compared to 2014; the impact of $65.2 million in higher cash collections related to the settlement of commodity derivative instruments partially offset the decrease resulting from lower oil and natural gas sales and lease bonus.\nTable 201: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less Than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More Than 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit facility\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 66,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 66,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 71,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 66,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nTable 188: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. Rotary Rig Count\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> First\nQuarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Second\nQuarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Third\nQuarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fourth\nQuarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Oil\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Natural gas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe are one of the largest owners of oil and natural gas mineral interests in the United States. Our principal business is maximizing the value of our existing portfolio of mineral and royalty assets through active management and expanding our asset base through acquisitions of additional mineral and royalty interests. We maximize value through the marketing of our mineral assets for lease, creative structuring of those leases to encourage and accelerate drilling activity, and selectively participating alongside our lessees on a working-interest basis. Our primary business objective is to grow our reserves, production, and cash generated from operations over the long term, while paying, to the extent practicable, a growing quarterly distribution to our unitholders.\nplays. In 2008 and 2009, we entered into lease agreements which covered the majority of our Hayneville/Bossier Shale acreage in Louisiana and Texas. As operators drilled wells to hold acreage, our natural gas production increased significantly in the plays, with volumes peaking in 2012. With most acreage now held by production, many operators have moved drilling rigs out of the plays. Although these wells initially produce at high rates, they tend to decline rapidly. Without consistent drilling activity to replace the high decline rates of the individual wells, the overall production rate from the plays has declined. While operators have recently begun to increase the drilling activity on our acreage, production from these new wells has not yet reached the point of offsetting declines in existing wells. Mineral-and-royalty-interest production made up 67.8% and 62.7% of our natural gas volumes for the period ending December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nNatural gas and natural gas liquids sales. An increase in the realized natural gas price for the twelve months of 2014 versus the same period in 2013 was responsible for the growth in our natural gas revenues. The favorable price variance was partially offset by a decrease in produced volumes. As we expected, natural gas production declined from period to period. The decline in both mineral-and-royalty-interest and working-interest volumes was primarily driven by the run-off in production in the Hayneville/Bossier Shale\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nTable

sources of revenue include mineral lease bonus and delay rentals, which are recognized as revenue according to the terms of the lease agreements. We generate lease bonus revenue from leasing our mineral interests to exploration and production companies. The lease agreements transfer the rights to any oil or natural gas discovered to the operators, grant us a right to a specified royalty interest, and require that drilling and completion operations be done within a specified time period. We recognize such lease bonus revenue at which time the lease agreement has been executed, payment is determined to be collectable, and we have no further\nThe board of directors of our general partner has adopted a policy pursuant to which distributions equal in amount to the applicable minimum quarterly distribution will be paid on each common and subordinated unit for each quarter to the extent we have sufficient cash generated from our operations after establishment of cash reserves, if any, and after we have made the required distributions to the holders of our outstanding preferred units. However, we do not have a legal or contractual obligation to pay distributions quarterly or on any other basis, at the applicable minimum quarterly distribution rate or at any other rate, and there is no guarantee that we will pay distributions to our unitholders in any quarter. Our minimum quarterly distribution provides the common unitholders a specified priority right to distributions over the subordinated unitholders. The board of directors of our general partner may change the foregoing distribution policy at any time and from time to time.\nInvesting Activities. The net cash used in investing activities decreased by $94.5 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to reduced capital spent on acquisitions and lower capital expenditures under our working-interest participation program.

Oil and condensate sales during 2015 were lower than the corresponding period in 2014 primarily due to a steep decline in realized prices. Our mineral-and-royalty-interest oil volumes accounted for 76.8% and 74.7% of total oil and condensate volumes for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the year ended December 31, 2014, respectively. Our mineral-and-royalty-interest oil volumes increased in 2015 relative to 2014 primarily driven by production increases from new wells in the Bakken/Three Forks and Eagle Ford plays. Our working-interest oil and condensate volumes increased during 2015 versus 2014 primarily due to volumes added from new wells in the Bakken/Three Forks and Wilcox plays.\nobligation to refund the payment. We also recognize revenue from delay rentals to the extent drilling has not started within the specified period, payment has been collected, and we have no further obligation to refund the payment.\nWe closed five separate transactions to acquire unproved oil and natural gas properties in the Permian Basin during 2015 for a total $51.7 million. We acquired acreage in the Eagle Ford Shale play through two transactions totaling $9.7 million during 2015, and we also acquired an overriding royalty interest in the Utica Shale and Marcellus plays for $1.8 million.\nFinancing Activities. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the net cash used in financing activities increased $168.0 million compared to the same period in 2013. During 2014, we made distributions to unitholders of $224.9 million, distributions on redeemable preferred units of $15.7 million, $57.0 million of credit facility repayments, and equity repurchases of $5.2 million, and we paid $7.6 million of consulting and other costs directly related to our initial public offering. During 2013, we received $191.6 million in equity contributions as a result of our exchange offer and borrowed $134.0 million under our credit facility. These activities were partially offset by distributions to unitholders of $225.7 million, distributions on redeemable preferred units of $15.7 million, equity repurchases of $118.1 million, repayments under our credit facility of $46.1 million, and purchases of noncontrolling interests of $60.7 million. Please read the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our exchange and equity offerings.\nFactors Affecting the Sales Price of Oil and Natural Gas\nFinancing Activities. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the net cash used in financing activities decreased $115.0 million compared to 2014. During 2015, we used net proceeds from our IPO to repay substantially all of our outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility. The proceeds received in excess of our net repayments resulted in a decrease in net cash used in financing activities from 2014. Monies borrowed to fund a $41.5 million cash tender offer for our preferred units plus unpaid accrued yield partially offset the overall decrease in net cash used in financing activities.\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization. Depletion is the amount of cost basis of oil and natural gas properties attributable to the volume of hydrocarbons extracted during such period, calculated on a units-of-production basis. Estimates of proved developed producing reserves are a major component of the calculation of depletion. We adjust our depletion rates semi-annually based upon the mid-year and year-end reserve reports, except when circumstances indicate that there has been a significant change in reserves or costs. Depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense decreased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to higher production rates offset by the impact of a reduced cost basis resulting from impairment charges related to prior periods.\nEquity-Based Compensation\nSource: EIA\n\nOur open oil and natural gas derivative contracts as of December 31, 2015 are detailed in Note 5 - Derivatives and Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Our credit facility agreement limits the extent to which we can hedge our future production. Under the terms of our credit facility agreement, we are able to hedge estimated production from our proved developed producing reserves based on our most recently completed reserve report provided to our lenders. We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes. Including derivative contracts entered into subsequent to December 31, 2015, we have hedged 91.7%, and 44.2% of our estimated oil and condensate production and 92.5%, and 46.5% of our estimated natural gas production from our proved developed producing reserves for 2016 and 2017, respectively.\nOverview\nCommon Unit Repurchase Program\nGain (loss) on commodity derivative instruments. In 2014, global oil inventories increased to the largest level since 2008. Supply and demand imbalances caused oil prices to decline sharply during the latter half of the year. In addition, robust domestic natural gas production coupled with a warmer than normal winter contributed to lower than average natural gas storage withdrawals. Natural gas prices reflected the abundant supplies. We used derivative instruments to mitigate the risk and resulting impact of such volatility. In 2014, we recognized $27.5 million of combined gains from oil commodity contracts, virtually all of which were unrealized, compared to $3.5 million of combined losses in 2013. In 2014, we recognized $9.8 million of net gains from natural gas commodity contracts, of which $11.8 million were unrealized, compared to $2.4 million of net losses in 2013.\nExploration expense. Exploration expense typically consists of dry-hole expenses and geological and geophysical costs, including seismic costs, and is expensed as incurred under the successful efforts method of accounting. Exploration expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased from the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to costs incurred to acquire 3-D seismic information related to our mineral and royalty interests from a third-party service provider.\nRevenues\nThe decrease in total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to a decrease of $228.9 million from lower realized commodity prices and $23.1 million of reduced lease bonus activity, partially offset by $52.9 million of gains attributable to commodity derivative instruments and $43.6 million related to higher oil and condensate production volumes.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses are costs not directly associated with the production of oil and natural gas and include the cost of employee salaries and related benefits, office expenses, and fees for professional services. For the year ended December 31, 2015, general and administrative expenses increased compared to 2014. In 2015, personnel costs and costs attributable to our long-term incentive plans were $12.3 million higher primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation awards granted subsequent to our IPO and certain restructuring costs. We also incurred an additional $2.5 million for our Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance project and other consulting work during 2015.\nProduction costs and ad valorem taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2014, production and ad valorem taxes increased over the year ended December 31, 2013 as a result of higher oil and natural gas sales.\nInterest expense. Interest expense decreased due to lower average outstanding borrowing under our credit facility. Outstanding borrowings during 2015 were lower than 2014, primarily due to payments made towards the outstanding balance of our credit facility with proceeds from our IPO.\nRevenue Recognition\nCredit Facility\nOur ongoing operations expose us to changes in the market price for oil and natural gas. To mitigate the given commodity price risk associated with its operations, we use derivative instruments. From time to time, such instruments may include fixed-price contracts, variable to fixed price swaps, costless collars, and other contractual arrangements. We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes. In addition, we currently employ a rolling hedge\u201d strategy whereby we generally hedge our proved developed producing reserves 18 to 24 months into the future. The impact of these derivative instruments could affect the amount of revenue we ultimately record.\n\nThe borrowing base under the third amended and restated credit agreement is redetermined semi-annually, on April 1 and October 1 of each year, by the administrative agent, taking into consideration the estimated loan value of our oil and natural gas properties consistent with the administrative agent's normal oil and natural gas lending criteria. The administrative agent's proposed redetermined borrowing base must be approved by all lenders to increase our existing borrowing base, and by two-thirds of the lenders to maintain or decrease our existing borrowing base. In addition, we and the lenders (at the election of two-thirds of the lenders) each have discretion once in between scheduled redeterminations, to have the borrowing base redetermined.\nInvesting Activities. The net cash used in investing activities decreased by $10.1 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to a reduction of $26.2 million in capital expenditures for our working interests, net of proceeds from the sales of oil and natural gas properties and a contractual termination payment related to a leasehold prospect. An increase of $16.7 million spent on acquisitions partially offset the overall decrease in net cash used in investing activities.\nbusiness, specifically the acquisition of mineral-and-royalty and working interests and the development of our oil and natural gas properties.\nLease bonus and other income. Lease bonus and delay rental revenue decreased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014. In 2014, we successfully closed several large leases in the Canyon Lime and Canyon Wash plays in north Texas, the Permian Basin in west Texas, the Austin Chalk and Woodbine play in east Texas, the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale play in Mississippi and the Bakken play in North Dakota. While we closed large lease transactions in 2015 in the Wolfcamp, the Eagle Ford Shale, various plays in East Texas and in Southern Mississippi, the total number of leases was down significantly from 2014.\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization. Depreciation, depletion, and amortization increased primarily due to an increase in our overall average depletion rate by field. The average depletion rate increased because of downward reserve revisions, which resulted from adjustments to estimates made by NSAI for projected lease operating expenses and natural gas shrinkage. In addition, during the second half of 2014, we experienced higher depletion expense for certain working-interest wells due to rapidly declining reservoir characteristics. Lower natural gas production volumes served to partially mitigate this increase in depletion rates.\n \u00b7 Oil. The substantial majority of our oil production is sold at prevailing market prices, which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of our control. NYMEX light sweet crude oil, commonly referred to as WTI, is the prevailing domestic oil pricing index. The majority of our oil production is priced at the prevailing market price with the final realized price affected by both quality and location differentials. \nThe following table shows our production, revenues, and expenses for the periods presented:\nOn May 1, 2015 our common units began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BSM.\u201d On May 6, 2015, we completed our initial public offering of 22,500,000 common units representing limited partner interests.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nLease bonus and other income. The increase in lease bonus and other income for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013 was primarily due to the successful closing of several significant leases in the Canyon Lime and Canyon Wash plays in north Texas and the Permian Basin during 2014.\nOil and condensate sales. Oil and condensate sales during the period were higher than the corresponding period in 2013 primarily due to an increase in production volumes. Our mineral-and-royalty-interest oil volumes accounted for 74.7% and 73.7% of total oil and condensate volumes for the year ended December 31, 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2013, respectively. The 16.1% increase in mineral-and-royalty-interest oil volumes, in 2014 relative to 2013 was driven primarily by production increases from new wells in the Eagle Ford Shale. Our working-interest oil volumes increased by 9.8% during 2014 versus 2013 primarily due to volumes added from new wells in the Bakken/Three Forks plays. The decrease in realized oil prices partially offset the impact on revenues from the increase in oil and condensate production.\nA substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sales of oil production attributable to our interests; however, the majority of our production is natural gas. Natural gas prices are significantly influenced by storage levels throughout the year. Accordingly, we monitor the natural gas storage reports regularly in the evaluation of our business and its outlook.\nCash Tender Offer\nOverview\nPlease read the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our accounting policies.\nNatural Gas Storage\nWe define EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, income taxes and depreciation, depletion, and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for impairment of oil and natural gas properties, accretion of ARO, unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments, and non-cash equity-based compensation. We define cash available for distribution as Adjusted EBITDA plus or minus amounts for certain non-cash operating activities, borrowings for capital expenditures, capital expenditures, cash interest expense, and distributions to noncontrolling interests and preferred unitholders.\nOur mineral and royalty interests consist of mineral interests in approximately 14.6 million acres, with an average 47.8% ownership interest in that acreage, NPRIs in 1.3 million acres, and ORRIs in 1.4 million acres. These non-cost-bearing interests include ownership in over 45,000 producing wells. We also own non-operated working interests, a significant portion of which are on positions where we also have a mineral and royalty interest. We recognize oil and natural gas revenue from our mineral and royalty and non-operated working interests in producing wells when the oil and natural gas production from the associated acreage is sold. Our other sources of revenue include mineral lease bonus and delay rentals, which are recognized as revenue according to the terms of the lease agreements.\nRecent Developments\nThe following table shows our cash flows for the periods presented:\n\nProduction costs and ad valorem taxes. Production taxes include statutory amounts deducted from our production revenues by various state taxing entities. Depending on the regulations of the states where the production originates, these taxes may be based on a percentage of the realized value or a fixed amount per production unit. This category also includes the costs to process and transport our production to applicable sales points. Ad valorem taxes are jurisdictional taxes levied on the value of oil and natural gas minerals and reserves. Rates, methods of calculating property values, and timing of payments vary between taxing authorities. For the year ended December 31, 2015, production and ad valorem taxes decreased over the year ended December 31, 2014, generally as a result of lower realized commodity prices and estimated mineral reserve valuations.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and cash available for distribution to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the periods indicated.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Related Estimates\nFactors Affecting the Comparability of Our Financial Results\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nGeneral and administrative. For the year ended December 31, 2014, general and administrative expenses increased as compared to 2013 primarily due to higher personnel costs and costs attributable to our long-term incentive plans. While our overall general and administrative expenses increased for 2014, our 2014 legal and broker fees were lower due to nonrecurring costs incurred to consummate our 2013 exchange offer and a one-time acquisition-related broker fee payment incurred in the prior period.\nCommodity Prices\nOperating Expenses\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nAt the beginning of each calendar year, we establish a capital budget and then monitor it throughout the year. Our capital budgets are created based upon our estimate of internally generated cash flows and the ability to borrow and raise additional capital. Actual capital expenditure levels will vary, in part, based on actual internally generated cash, actual wells proposed by our operators for our participation, and the successful closing of acquisitions. The timing, size, and nature of acquisitions are unpredictable.\nVolumes of Oil and Natural Gas Produced\nThe effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nThe following table reflects commodity prices at the end of each of the four quarters for the most recently completed fiscal year:\nQuality differentials result from the heating value of natural gas measured in Btus and the presence of impurities, such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen. Natural gas containing ethane and heavier hydrocarbons has a higher Btu value and will realize a higher volumetric price than natural gas made up of predominantly methane, which has a lower Btu value. Natural gas with a higher concentration of impurities will realize a lower volumetric price due to the presence of the impurities in the natural gas when sold or the cost of treating the natural gas to meet pipeline quality specifications.\nHedging\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nWe enter into derivative instruments to partially mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility on our cash generated from operations. From time to time, such instruments may include fixed-price swaps, costless collars, fixed-price contracts, and other contractual arrangements. We currently employ a rolling hedge\u201d strategy whereby we hedge a significant portion of our proved developed producing reserves 18 to 24 months into the future. The impact of these derivative instruments could affect the amount of revenue we ultimately realize. Throughout 2014, we entered into costless collars to allow us the ability to participate in upward movements in commodity prices while also setting a price floor for a portion of our production. Costless collars are a combination of a purchased put option and a sold call option, in which the premiums paid and received net to zero. During the fourth quarter of 2014 and all of 2015, we also entered into fixed-price swap contracts. Under fixed-price swap contracts, a counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is less than the swap strike price; conversely, we are required to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is greater than the swap strike price. We may employ contractual arrangements other than costless collars and fixed-price swap contracts in the future to mitigate the impact of price fluctuations. If commodity prices decline in the future, our hedging contracts will partially mitigate the effect of lower prices on our future revenue.\nOutstanding borrowings under the third amended and restated credit facility bear interest at a floating rate elected by us equal to an alternative base rate (which is equal to the greatest of the Prime rate, the Federal Funds effective rate plus 0.5%, or 1-month LIBOR plus 1.0%) or LIBOR, in each case plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin ranges from 0.50% to 1.50% in the case of the alternative base rate and from 1.50% to 2.50% in the case of LIBOR, in each case depending on the amount of borrowings outstanding in relation to the borrowing base. We are obligated to pay a quarterly commitment fee ranging from 0.375% to 0.500% per year on the unused portion of the borrowing base, depending on the amount of the borrowings outstanding in relation to the borrowing base. Principal may be optionally repaid from time to time without premium or penalty, other than customary LIBOR breakage, and is required to be paid (a) if the amount outstanding exceeds the borrowing base, whether due to a borrowing base redetermination or otherwise, in some cases subject to a cure period or (b) at the maturity date. The third amended and restated credit facility is secured by liens on substantially all of our properties.\nOur financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented may not be comparable, either from period to period or going forward, because we will incur higher general and administrative expenses than in prior periods as a result of operating as a publicly traded partnership. These incremental expenses include costs associated with SEC reporting requirements, including annual and quarterly reports to unitholders; tax return and Schedule K-1 preparation and distribution; Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance; New York Stock Exchange listing fees; independent registered public accounting firm fees; legal fees, investor-relations activities, registrar and transfer agent fees; director-and-officer insurance; and additional compensation. These direct, incremental general and administrative expenses are not included in our historical results of operations for periods prior to our IPO.\nRig Count\nSuccessful Efforts Method of Accounting\nCash Flows\nAt December 31, 2015, we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nInterest expense. Interest expense increased due to additional borrowings under our credit facility. Outstanding borrowings during 2014 were higher than 2013, primarily due to increased expenditures for acquisitions, drilling activity, and common equity repurchases during 2013.\nLease operating expense. Lease operating expense was substantially consistent between periods.\nOperating Expenses\nFair values of legal obligations to retire and remove long-lived assets are recorded when the obligation is incurred and becomes determinable. When the liability is initially recorded, we capitalize this cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related property and equipment. Over time, the liability is accreted for the change in its present value, and the capitalized cost in oil and natural gas properties is depleted based on units of production consistent with the related asset.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n \u00b7 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and cash available for distribution. \nThe information below is designed to give a broad overview of the oil and natural gas business environment as it affects us.\nyear ended December 31, 2014, our cash expenditures for acquisitions totaled $45.6 million versus $121.6 million for the same period in 2013. Capital expenditures for our working interests, net of sale proceeds, decreased by $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 versus the comparable period of 2013.\nSince we are not an operator, drilling on our acreage is dependent upon the exploration and production companies that lease our acreage. In addition to drilling plans that we seek from our operators, we monitor rig counts in an effort to identify existing and future leasing and drilling activity on our acreage.\nOther exploratory costs, including annual delay rentals and geological and geophysical costs, are expensed when incurred. Mineral and royalty interests and working interests are recorded at cost at the time of acquisition. Upon sale or retirement of depreciable or depletable property, the cost and related accumulated DD&A are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is recognized.\nWe use the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and natural gas operations. Under this method, costs to acquire interests in oil and natural gas properties are capitalized. The cost of property acquisitions, successful exploratory wells, development costs, and support equipment and facilities are initially capitalized when incurred. DD&A of producing oil and natural gas properties is recorded based on a units-of-production methodology. Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized on the basis of all proved reserves, developed and undeveloped, and capitalized development costs are amortized on the basis of proved developed reserves. Proved reserves are quantities of oil and natural gas that can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. A sustained low price environment could decrease our estimate of proved reserves, which would increase the rate at which we record depletion expense and reduce net income. Additionally, a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our assessment of producing properties for impairment. We are unable to predict future commodity prices with any greater precision than the futures market. The impact of commodity prices can be illustrated as follows. If we assumed the average 12-month forward strip pricing as of December 31, 2015 was held constant in determining our reserves, our estimated proved reserves on a Boe basis as of December 31, 2015 would have declined by approximately 2%.\nDuring 2015, we spent approximately $63.2 million on eight acquisitions. We also incurred approximately $60.1 million related to drilling and completion costs, the majority of which was in the Haynesville/Bossier, Bakken/Three Forks, and Wilcox plays. Our 2016 capital budget for drilling expenditures is approximately $60.0 million. Approximately 95% of our drilling capital budget will be spent in the Haynesville/Bossier and Bakken/Three Forks plays, respectively, with the remainder spent in various plays including the Wolfcamp and Wilcox plays.\nImpairment of oil and natural gas properties. Individual categories of oil and natural gas properties are assessed periodically to determine if the net book value for these properties has been impaired. Management periodically conducts an in-depth evaluation of the cost of property acquisitions, successful exploratory wells, development activities, unproved leasehold, and mineral interests to identify impairments. Impairments for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 primarily resulted from changes in reserve values due to declines in future expected realized net cash flows as a result of lower commodity prices.\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of our accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. The following discussions of critical accounting estimates, including any related discussion of contingencies, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions could be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. We have provided expanded discussion of our more significant accounting estimates below.\nResults of Operations\nNatural gas, which currently has a limited global transportation system, is subject to price variances based on local supply and demand conditions and the cost to transport natural gas to end user markets.\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations, borrowings under our credit facility, and proceeds from any future issuances of equity and debt. Our primary uses of cash are for distributions to our unitholders and for investing in our\nOn November 6, 2015, we commenced a tender offer to purchase up to 100% of the 117,963 then outstanding preferred units from our preferred unitholders at the units' par value of $1,000.00 per preferred unit, plus unpaid accrued yield. The tender offer expired on December 10, 2015. We purchased and cancelled 40,747 preferred units, representing 34.5% of our then outstanding preferred units. The preferred units were purchased at a purchase price of $1,019.45 per preferred unit for a total cost of approximately $41.5 million, excluding fees and expenses relating to the tender offer.\nThe following table shows our production, revenues, and expenses for the periods presented:\nIn order to assess and track the performance of our assets, we monitor and analyze production volumes from the various basins and plays that comprise our extensive asset base. We also regularly compare projected volumes to actual reported volumes and investigate unexpected variations.\n As a mineral-and-royalty-interest owner, we are often provided insufficient and inconsistent data by our operators. As a result, we are unable to reliably determine the total volumes of NGLs associated with the production of natural gas on our acreage. As such, the realized prices account for all sales attributable to NGLs. The oil and condensate production volumes and natural gas production volumes do not include NGL volumes. \nDerivative instruments are recognized at fair value. If a right of offset exists under master netting arrangements and certain other criteria are met, derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are netted on the consolidated balance sheet. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized on a net basis in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations within gain (loss) on commodity derivative instruments. Although these derivative instruments may expose us to credit risk, we monitor the creditworthiness of our counterparties.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth under Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\n \u00b7 Natural Gas. The NYMEX price quoted at Henry Hub is a widely used benchmark for the pricing of natural gas in the United States. The actual volumetric prices realized from the sale of natural gas differ from the quoted NYMEX price as a result of quality and location differentials. \nWe recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. Revenues are considered realized or realizable and earned when: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. We recognize oil and natural gas revenue from our interests in producing wells when the associated production is sold. To the extent actual volumes and prices of oil and natural gas are unavailable for a given reporting period because of timing or information not received from third parties, the expected sales volume and prices for these properties are estimated and recorded within accounts receivable. Crude oil is priced on the delivery date based upon prevailing prices published by purchasers with certain adjustments related to oil quality and physical location. Natural gas contracts' pricing provisions are tied to a market index, with certain adjustments based on, among other factors, whether a well delivers to a gathering or transmission line, quality and heat content of natural gas, and prevailing supply and demand conditions, so that the price of natural gas fluctuates to remain competitive with other available natural gas supplies. These market indices are determined on a monthly basis.\nOperating Activities. For the year ended December 31, 2014, cash flows from operating activities increased by $75.4 million as compared to the same period in 2013 due to increased realized natural gas prices, higher oil and condensate volumes, and higher lease bonus revenue.\nThe chemical composition of crude oil plays an important role in its refining and subsequent sale as petroleum products. As a result, variations in chemical composition relative to the benchmark crude oil, usually WTI, will result in price adjustments, which are often referred to as quality differentials. The characteristics that most significantly affect quality differentials include the density of the oil, as characterized by its API gravity, and the presence and concentration of impurities, such as sulfur.\n\nUnder various contracts, permits, and regulations, we have legal obligations to restore the land at the end of operations at certain properties where we own non-operated working interests. Estimating the future restoration costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult. Most of these restoration obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what practices and criteria must be met when the event actually occurs. Asset-restoration technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into the valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change.\nDerivatives and Financial Instruments\nThe following table shows natural gas storage volumes by region at the end of each of the four quarters for the most recently completed fiscal year:\nPrior to our initial public offering, the board of directors of our Predecessor determined the fair value of unit-based awards by considering various objective and subjective factors, along with input from management, and using the same methodology as required under our Predecessor's partnership agreement for purposes of repurchasing Predecessor common units from those limited partners who exercise their right to annually sell a portion of their units. To determine the fair value of the unit-based awards, the board of directors of our Predecessor considered information provided by third-party consultants and relied on generally accepted valuation techniques, which included the net asset value method under the asset approach, the guideline public company method under the market approach, and the dividend discount method of the income approach. Estimates of value using the net asset value method were derived using assumptions including commodity prices, estimated development timing of our acreage, and market-based discount rates. The value conclusion using the guideline public company method was estimated by considering peer company performance metrics, comparability of the peer company portfolio and risk profiles, and implied forward distribution yields and multiples. To estimate the value of the awards using the transaction method, publicly available data related to acquisitions of mineral properties and applied the implied deal metrics to our performance measures were reviewed. The dividend discount method was developed based on assumptions including our projected distributions, anticipated long-term distribution growth rates, and near- and long-term cost of capital estimates. In determining the fair value of the awards, the board of directors of our Predecessor also considered our historical transactions and performance in making these estimates.\nSource: Baker Hughes Incorporated\nTotal revenue. The increase in total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 was made up of $43.2 million from commodity derivative instruments, $23.8 million resulting from higher production volumes, $14.3 million from higher lease bonus, and $3.4 million from higher realized commodity prices.\ninterest production made up 67.3% and 67.8% of our natural gas volumes for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOil and natural gas prices have been historically volatile based upon the dynamics of supply and demand. During 2015, oil and natural gas prices have remained significantly below prices seen over the past five years as global concerns of long-term supply imbalances and slowing demand growth have continued to weigh on prices. West Texas Intermediate ( WTI\u201d) spot prices ranged from a low of $34.55 per Bbl on December 21, 2015 to a high of $61.36 per Bbl on June 10, 2015. Oil prices have continued to be pressured downward following the end of the year, reaching a low of $26.19 per Bbl on February 11, 2016. During 2015, Henry Hub spot natural gas prices ranged from a low of $1.63 per MMBtu on December 23, 2015 to a high of $3.32 per MMBtu on January 15, 2015. The Henry Hub spot price closed at $1.62 per MMBtu on February 29, 2016. To manage the variability in cash flows associated with the projected sale of our oil and natural gas production, we use various derivative instruments, which have generally consisted of fixed-price swaps and costless collars.\n \u00b7 volumes of oil and natural gas produced; \nThe prices we receive for oil, natural gas, and NGLs vary by geographical area. The relative prices of these products are determined by the factors affecting global and regional supply and demand dynamics, such as economic conditions, production levels, availability of transportation, weather cycles, and other factors. In addition, realized prices are influenced by product quality and proximity to consuming and refining markets. Any differences between realized prices and NYMEX prices are referred to as differentials. All of our production is derived from properties located in the United States. As a result of our geographic diversification, we are not exposed to concentrated differential risks associated with any single play, trend, or basin.\nBusiness Environment\n\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and cash available for distribution are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures used by our management and external users of our financial statements such as investors, research analysts, and others, to assess the financial performance of our assets and our ability to sustain distributions over the long term without regard to financing methods, capital structure, or historical cost basis.\nGain on commodity derivative instruments. In 2015, we recognized $57.7 million of gains from oil commodity contracts, of which $15.9 million were realized, compared to $27.5 million of combined gains in 2014, virtually all of which were unrealized. In 2015, we recognized $32.6 million of gains from natural gas commodity contracts, of which $11.2 million were unrealized, compared to $9.8 million of net gains in 2014, of which $11.8 million were unrealized gains.\nDuring 2014, we spent $45.6 million on three cash acquisitions and completed another acquisition for $2.3 million with an issuance of equity securities. In 2014, we spent approximately $67.7 million on drilling and completion costs.\nExploration expense. Exploration expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased from the same period in 2013 due to costs related to a dry hole that was drilled during 2014.\nThe following table shows the rig count at the end of each of the four quarters for the most recently completed fiscal year:\nContractual Obligations\nRevenues\nThe third amended and restated credit agreement contains various affirmative, negative, and financial maintenance covenants. These covenants, among other things, limit additional indebtedness, additional liens, sales of assets, mergers and consolidations, dividends and distributions, transactions with affiliates and entering into certain swap agreements, as well as require the maintenance of certain financial ratios. The third amended and restated credit agreement contains two financial covenants: total debt to EBITDAX of 3.5:1.0 or less; and a modified current ratio of 1.0:1.0 or greater. Distributions are not permitted if there is a default under the third amended and restated credit agreement (including due to a failure to satisfy one of the financial covenants) or during any time that our borrowing base is lower than the loans outstanding under the third amended and restated credit facility. The lenders have the right to accelerate all of the indebtedness under the third amended and restated credit facility upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any event of default, and the third amended and restated credit agreement contains customary events of default, including non-payment, breach of covenants, materially incorrect representations, cross-default, bankruptcy, and change of control. There are no cure periods for events of default due to non-payment of principal and breaches of negative and financial covenants, but non-payment of interest and breaches of certain affirmative covenants are subject to customary cure periods. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.\nWe use a variety of operational and financial measures to assess our performance. Among the measures considered by management are the following:\nThe following table summarizes our minimum payments as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nImpairment of oil and natural gas properties. Impairments totaled $117.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to changes in reserve values resulting from the drop in commodity prices and other factors. Impairments totaled $57.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to the impact that changes in price had on the value of our reserve estimates.\nHistorically, natural gas supply and demand fluctuates on a seasonal basis. From April to October, when the weather is warmer and natural gas demand is lower, natural gas storage levels generally increase. From November to March, storage levels typically decline as utility companies draw natural gas from storage to meet increased heating demand due to colder weather. In order to maintain sufficient storage levels for increased seasonal demand, a portion of natural gas production during the summer months must be used for storage injection. The portion of production used for storage varies from year to year depending on the demand from the previous winter and the demand for electricity used for cooling during the summer months.\nAcquisitions\nWe evaluate impairment of producing properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We estimate the undiscounted future cash flows expected in connection with the properties and compare such undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable. When the carrying amount of a property exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, the carrying amount is reduced to its fair value. Fair value is calculated as the present value of estimated future discounted cash flows of such properties. The factors used to determine fair value include estimates of proved reserves, future commodity prices, timing of future production, future capital expenditures, and a risk-adjusted discount rate. The markets for oil and natural gas have a history of significant price volatility. However, a sustained low price environment could result in lower NYMEX forward strip prices and lower estimates of future cash flows expected from our properties. Such decrease in cash flow estimates could result in recording additional impairment for our properties if such circumstances indicated the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.\n \u00b7 commodity prices including the effect of hedges; and \n\nOn January 23, 2015, we amended and restated our $1.0 billion senior secured revolving credit agreement. Under this third amended and restated credit facility, the commitment of the lenders equals the lesser of the aggregate maximum credit amounts of the lenders or the borrowing base, which is determined based on the lenders' estimated value of our oil and natural gas properties. On October 28, 2015, the third amended and restated credit facility was further amended to extend the term of the agreement from February 3, 2017 to February 4, 2019. Borrowings under the third amended and restated credit facility may be used for the acquisition of properties, cash distributions, and other general corporate purposes. Our semi-annual borrowing base redetermination process resulted in a decrease of the borrowing base from $600.0 million to $550.0 million, effective October 28, 2015. Our next borrowing base redetermination is scheduled for April 2016. As of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding borrowings of $66.0 million at a weighted-average interest rate of 1.92%. We used net proceeds from our IPO in May 2015 to repay substantially all indebtedness then outstanding under our third amended and restated credit facility.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and cash available for distribution should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, cash flows from operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP as measures of our financial performance. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and cash available for distribution have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Our computation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and cash available for distribution may differ from computations of similarly titled measures of other companies.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n As a mineral-and-royalty-interest owner, we are often provided insufficient and inconsistent data by our operators. As a result, we are unable to reliably determine the total volumes of NGLs associated with the production of natural gas on our acreage. As such, the realized prices account for all sales attributable to NGLs. The oil and condensate production volumes and natural gas production volumes do not include NGL volumes. \nCommodity Prices\nNew and Revised Financial Accounting Standards\nWe recognize equity-based compensation expense for unit-based awards granted to our employees and the board of directors of our general partner. Total compensation expense for unit-based awards is calculated based on the number of units granted multiplied by the grant-date fair value per unit. Compensation expense for time-based restricted unit awards with graded vesting requirements are recognized using straight-line attribution over the requisite service period. Compensation expense related to the restricted performance unit awards is determined by multiplying the number of common units underlying such awards that, based on our estimates, are likely to vest, by the grant-date fair value and recognized using the accelerated attribution method. Equity-based compensation expense related to unit-based awards is included in general and administrative expense within the consolidated statements of operations. Distribution equivalent rights for the restricted performance unit awards that are expected to vest are charged to partners' capital. Please read Note 10 - Incentive Compensation within the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information.\nThe costs of unproved leaseholds and mineral interests are capitalized as unproved properties pending the results of exploration efforts. As unproved leaseholds are determined to be proved, the related costs are transferred to proved properties. Unproved and non-producing property costs are assessed periodically, on a property-by-property basis, and an impairment loss is recognized to the extent, if any, the recorded value has been impaired. Mineral interests are recorded at cost at the time of acquisition. Mineral interests are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. This assessment is performed by comparing carrying values to valuation estimates and impairment is recognized to the extent that book value exceeds estimated recoverable value. Any impairment will generally be based on geographic or geologic data and our estimated future cash flows related to our properties.\nOn March 4, 2016, the board of directors of our general partner authorized the repurchase of up to $50.0 million in common units over the next six months. The repurchase program authorizes us to make repurchases on a discretionary basis as determined by management, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, available liquidity, and other appropriate factors. All or a portion of any repurchases may be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which would permit common units to be repurchased when we might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws. The repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common units and may be modified or suspended at any time and could be terminated prior to completion. We will periodically report the number of common units repurchased. The repurchase program will be funded from our cash on hand or available revolving credit facility. Any repurchased common units will be cancelled.\nLocation differentials generally result from transportation costs based on the produced oil's proximity to consuming and refining markets and major trading points.", "item_7_text": "Operating Activities. Our operating cash flow is dependent, in large part, on our production, realized commodity prices, leasing revenues, and operating expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2015, cash flows from operating activities decreased by $111.4 million. This decrease was primarily due to lower cash collections of $190.0 million related to oil and natural gas sales and lease bonus revenue as compared to 2014; the impact of $65.2 million in higher cash collections related to the settlement of commodity derivative instruments partially offset the decrease resulting from lower oil and natural gas sales and lease bonus.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nWe are one of the largest owners of oil and natural gas mineral interests in the United States. Our principal business is maximizing the value of our existing portfolio of mineral and royalty assets through active management and expanding our asset base through acquisitions of additional mineral and royalty interests. We maximize value through the marketing of our mineral assets for lease, creative structuring of those leases to encourage and accelerate drilling activity, and selectively participating alongside our lessees on a working-interest basis. Our primary business objective is to grow our reserves, production, and cash generated from operations over the long term, while paying, to the extent practicable, a growing quarterly distribution to our unitholders.\nplays. In 2008 and 2009, we entered into lease agreements which covered the majority of our Hayneville/Bossier Shale acreage in Louisiana and Texas. As operators drilled wells to hold acreage, our natural gas production increased significantly in the plays, with volumes peaking in 2012. With most acreage now held by production, many operators have moved drilling rigs out of the plays. Although these wells initially produce at high rates, they tend to decline rapidly. Without consistent drilling activity to replace the high decline rates of the individual wells, the overall production rate from the plays has declined. While operators have recently begun to increase the drilling activity on our acreage, production from these new wells has not yet reached the point of offsetting declines in existing wells. Mineral-and-royalty-interest production made up 67.8% and 62.7% of our natural gas volumes for the period ending December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nNatural gas and natural gas liquids sales. An increase in the realized natural gas price for the twelve months of 2014 versus the same period in 2013 was responsible for the growth in our natural gas revenues. The favorable price variance was partially offset by a decrease in produced volumes. As we expected, natural gas production declined from period to period. The decline in both mineral-and-royalty-interest and working-interest volumes was primarily driven by the run-off in production in the Hayneville/Bossier Shale\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\n\nWe intend to finance our future acquisitions and working-interest capital needs with cash generated from operations, borrowings from our credit facility, and proceeds from any future issuances of equity and debt. Replacement capital expenditures are expenditures necessary to replace our existing oil and natural gas reserves or otherwise maintain our asset base over the long-term. Like a number of other master limited partnerships, we are required by our partnership agreement to retain cash from our operations in an amount equal to our estimated replacement capital requirements. We have set our distribution rate at a level we believe will allow us to retain in our business sufficient cash generated from our operations to satisfy our replacement capital expenditures needs and to fund a portion of our growth capital expenditures. The board of directors of our general partner is responsible for establishing the amount of our estimated replacement capital expenditures.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nOur other sources of revenue include mineral lease bonus and delay rentals, which are recognized as revenue according to the terms of the lease agreements. We generate lease bonus revenue from leasing our mineral interests to exploration and production companies. The lease agreements transfer the rights to any oil or natural gas discovered to the operators, grant us a right to a specified royalty interest, and require that drilling and completion operations be done within a specified time period. We recognize such lease bonus revenue at which time the lease agreement has been executed, payment is determined to be collectable, and we have no further\nThe board of directors of our general partner has adopted a policy pursuant to which distributions equal in amount to the applicable minimum quarterly distribution will be paid on each common and subordinated unit for each quarter to the extent we have sufficient cash generated from our operations after establishment of cash reserves, if any, and after we have made the required distributions to the holders of our outstanding preferred units. However, we do not have a legal or contractual obligation to pay distributions quarterly or on any other basis, at the applicable minimum quarterly distribution rate or at any other rate, and there is no guarantee that we will pay distributions to our unitholders in any quarter. Our minimum quarterly distribution provides the common unitholders a specified priority right to distributions over the subordinated unitholders. The board of directors of our general partner may change the foregoing distribution policy at any time and from time to time.\nInvesting Activities. The net cash used in investing activities decreased by $94.5 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to reduced capital spent on acquisitions and lower capital expenditures under our working-interest participation program. For the\nNatural gas and natural gas liquids sales. Natural gas revenues decreased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014. A significant decline in the realized natural gas and NGL prices for the year ended December 31, 2015 versus the corresponding period in 2014 was primarily responsible for the decrease in our natural gas and NGL revenues. Mineral-and-royalty-\nSource: EIA\nLease operating expenses. Lease operating expense includes normally recurring expenses necessary to produce hydrocarbons from our non-operated working interests in oil and natural gas wells, as well as certain nonrecurring expenses, such as well repairs. Lease operating expense increased slightly for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to higher oil and condensate production.\nCapital Expenditures\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nOil and condensate sales. Oil and condensate sales during 2015 were lower than the corresponding period in 2014 primarily due to a steep decline in realized prices. Our mineral-and-royalty-interest oil volumes accounted for 76.8% and 74.7% of total oil and condensate volumes for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the year ended December 31, 2014, respectively. Our mineral-and-royalty-interest oil volumes increased in 2015 relative to 2014 primarily driven by production increases from new wells in the Bakken/Three Forks and Eagle Ford plays. Our working-interest oil and condensate volumes increased during 2015 versus 2014 primarily due to volumes added from new wells in the Bakken/Three Forks and Wilcox plays.\nobligation to refund the payment. We also recognize revenue from delay rentals to the extent drilling has not started within the specified period, payment has been collected, and we have no further obligation to refund the payment.\nWe closed five separate transactions to acquire unproved oil and natural gas properties in the Permian Basin during 2015 for a total $51.7 million. We acquired acreage in the Eagle Ford Shale play through two transactions totaling $9.7 million during 2015, and we also acquired an overriding royalty interest in the Utica Shale and Marcellus plays for $1.8 million.\nFinancing Activities. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the net cash used in financing activities increased $168.0 million compared to the same period in 2013. During 2014, we made distributions to unitholders of $224.9 million, distributions on redeemable preferred units of $15.7 million, $57.0 million of credit facility repayments, and equity repurchases of $5.2 million, and we paid $7.6 million of consulting and other costs directly related to our initial public offering. During 2013, we received $191.6 million in equity contributions as a result of our exchange offer and borrowed $134.0 million under our credit facility. These activities were partially offset by distributions to unitholders of $225.7 million, distributions on redeemable preferred units of $15.7 million, equity repurchases of $118.1 million, repayments under our credit facility of $46.1 million, and purchases of noncontrolling interests of $60.7 million. Please read the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our exchange and equity offerings.\nFactors Affecting the Sales Price of Oil and Natural Gas\nFinancing Activities. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the net cash used in financing activities decreased $115.0 million compared to 2014. During 2015, we used net proceeds from our IPO to repay substantially all of our outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility. The proceeds received in excess of our net repayments resulted in a decrease in net cash used in financing activities from 2014. Monies borrowed to fund a $41.5 million cash tender offer for our preferred units plus unpaid accrued yield partially offset the overall decrease in net cash used in financing activities.\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization. Depletion is the amount of cost basis of oil and natural gas properties attributable to the volume of hydrocarbons extracted during such period, calculated on a units-of-production basis. Estimates of proved developed producing reserves are a major component of the calculation of depletion. We adjust our depletion rates semi-annually based upon the mid-year and year-end reserve reports, except when circumstances indicate that there has been a significant change in reserves or costs. Depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense decreased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to higher production rates offset by the impact of a reduced cost basis resulting from impairment charges related to prior periods.\nEquity-Based Compensation\nSource: EIA\n\nOur open oil and natural gas derivative contracts as of December 31, 2015 are detailed in Note 5 - Derivatives and Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Our credit facility agreement limits the extent to which we can hedge our future production. Under the terms of our credit facility agreement, we are able to hedge estimated production from our proved developed producing reserves based on our most recently completed reserve report provided to our lenders. We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes. Including derivative contracts entered into subsequent to December 31, 2015, we have hedged 91.7%, and 44.2% of our estimated oil and condensate production and 92.5%, and 46.5% of our estimated natural gas production from our proved developed producing reserves for 2016 and 2017, respectively.\nOverview\nCommon Unit Repurchase Program\nGain (loss) on commodity derivative instruments. In 2014, global oil inventories increased to the largest level since 2008. Supply and demand imbalances caused oil prices to decline sharply during the latter half of the year. In addition, robust domestic natural gas production coupled with a warmer than normal winter contributed to lower than average natural gas storage withdrawals. Natural gas prices reflected the abundant supplies. We used derivative instruments to mitigate the risk and resulting impact of such volatility. In 2014, we recognized $27.5 million of combined gains from oil commodity contracts, virtually all of which were unrealized, compared to $3.5 million of combined losses in 2013. In 2014, we recognized $9.8 million of net gains from natural gas commodity contracts, of which $11.8 million were unrealized, compared to $2.4 million of net losses in 2013.\nExploration expense. Exploration expense typically consists of dry-hole expenses and geological and geophysical costs, including seismic costs, and is expensed as incurred under the successful efforts method of accounting. Exploration expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased from the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to costs incurred to acquire 3-D seismic information related to our mineral and royalty interests from a third-party service provider.\nRevenues\nThe decrease in total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to a decrease of $228.9 million from lower realized commodity prices and $23.1 million of reduced lease bonus activity, partially offset by $52.9 million of gains attributable to commodity derivative instruments and $43.6 million related to higher oil and condensate production volumes.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses are costs not directly associated with the production of oil and natural gas and include the cost of employee salaries and related benefits, office expenses, and fees for professional services. For the year ended December 31, 2015, general and administrative expenses increased compared to 2014. In 2015, personnel costs and costs attributable to our long-term incentive plans were $12.3 million higher primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation awards granted subsequent to our IPO and certain restructuring costs. We also incurred an additional $2.5 million for our Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance project and other consulting work during 2015.\nProduction costs and ad valorem taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2014, production and ad valorem taxes increased over the year ended December 31, 2013 as a result of higher oil and natural gas sales.\nInterest expense. Interest expense decreased due to lower average outstanding borrowing under our credit facility. Outstanding borrowings during 2015 were lower than 2014, primarily due to payments made towards the outstanding balance of our credit facility with proceeds from our IPO.\nRevenue Recognition\nCredit Facility\nOur ongoing operations expose us to changes in the market price for oil and natural gas. To mitigate the given commodity price risk associated with its operations, we use derivative instruments. From time to time, such instruments may include fixed-price contracts, variable to fixed price swaps, costless collars, and other contractual arrangements. We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes. In addition, we currently employ a rolling hedge\u201d strategy whereby we generally hedge our proved developed producing reserves 18 to 24 months into the future. The impact of these derivative instruments could affect the amount of revenue we ultimately record.\n\nThe borrowing base under the third amended and restated credit agreement is redetermined semi-annually, on April 1 and October 1 of each year, by the administrative agent, taking into consideration the estimated loan value of our oil and natural gas properties consistent with the administrative agent's normal oil and natural gas lending criteria. The administrative agent's proposed redetermined borrowing base must be approved by all lenders to increase our existing borrowing base, and by two-thirds of the lenders to maintain or decrease our existing borrowing base. In addition, we and the lenders (at the election of two-thirds of the lenders) each have discretion once in between scheduled redeterminations, to have the borrowing base redetermined.\nInvesting Activities. The net cash used in investing activities decreased by $10.1 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to a reduction of $26.2 million in capital expenditures for our working interests, net of proceeds from the sales of oil and natural gas properties and a contractual termination payment related to a leasehold prospect. An increase of $16.7 million spent on acquisitions partially offset the overall decrease in net cash used in investing activities.\nbusiness, specifically the acquisition of mineral-and-royalty and working interests and the development of our oil and natural gas properties.\nLease bonus and other income. Lease bonus and delay rental revenue decreased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014. In 2014, we successfully closed several large leases in the Canyon Lime and Canyon Wash plays in north Texas, the Permian Basin in west Texas, the Austin Chalk and Woodbine play in east Texas, the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale play in Mississippi and the Bakken play in North Dakota. While we closed large lease transactions in 2015 in the Wolfcamp, the Eagle Ford Shale, various plays in East Texas and in Southern Mississippi, the total number of leases was down significantly from 2014.\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization. Depreciation, depletion, and amortization increased primarily due to an increase in our overall average depletion rate by field. The average depletion rate increased because of downward reserve revisions, which resulted from adjustments to estimates made by NSAI for projected lease operating expenses and natural gas shrinkage. In addition, during the second half of 2014, we experienced higher depletion expense for certain working-interest wells due to rapidly declining reservoir characteristics. Lower natural gas production volumes served to partially mitigate this increase in depletion rates.\n \u00b7 Oil. The substantial majority of our oil production is sold at prevailing market prices, which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of our control. NYMEX light sweet crude oil, commonly referred to as WTI, is the prevailing domestic oil pricing index. The majority of our oil production is priced at the prevailing market price with the final realized price affected by both quality and location differentials. \nThe following table shows our production, revenues, and expenses for the periods presented:\nOn May 1, 2015 our common units began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BSM.\u201d On May 6, 2015, we completed our initial public offering of 22,500,000 common units representing limited partner interests.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nLease bonus and other income. The increase in lease bonus and other income for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013 was primarily due to the successful closing of several significant leases in the Canyon Lime and Canyon Wash plays in north Texas and the Permian Basin during 2014.\nOil and condensate sales. Oil and condensate sales during the period were higher than the corresponding period in 2013 primarily due to an increase in production volumes. Our mineral-and-royalty-interest oil volumes accounted for 74.7% and 73.7% of total oil and condensate volumes for the year ended December 31, 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2013, respectively. The 16.1% increase in mineral-and-royalty-interest oil volumes, in 2014 relative to 2013 was driven primarily by production increases from new wells in the Eagle Ford Shale. Our working-interest oil volumes increased by 9.8% during 2014 versus 2013 primarily due to volumes added from new wells in the Bakken/Three Forks plays. The decrease in realized oil prices partially offset the impact on revenues from the increase in oil and condensate production.\nA substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sales of oil production attributable to our interests; however, the majority of our production is natural gas. Natural gas prices are significantly influenced by storage levels throughout the year. Accordingly, we monitor the natural gas storage reports regularly in the evaluation of our business and its outlook.\nCash Tender Offer\nOverview\nPlease read the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our accounting policies.\nNatural Gas Storage\nWe define EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, income taxes and depreciation, depletion, and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for impairment of oil and natural gas properties, accretion of ARO, unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments, and non-cash equity-based compensation. We define cash available for distribution as Adjusted EBITDA plus or minus amounts for certain non-cash operating activities, borrowings for capital expenditures, capital expenditures, cash interest expense, and distributions to noncontrolling interests and preferred unitholders.\nOur mineral and royalty interests consist of mineral interests in approximately 14.6 million acres, with an average 47.8% ownership interest in that acreage, NPRIs in 1.3 million acres, and ORRIs in 1.4 million acres. These non-cost-bearing interests include ownership in over 45,000 producing wells. We also own non-operated working interests, a significant portion of which are on positions where we also have a mineral and royalty interest. We recognize oil and natural gas revenue from our mineral and royalty and non-operated working interests in producing wells when the oil and natural gas production from the associated acreage is sold. Our other sources of revenue include mineral lease bonus and delay rentals, which are recognized as revenue according to the terms of the lease agreements.\nRecent Developments\nThe following table shows our cash flows for the periods presented:\n\nProduction costs and ad valorem taxes. Production taxes include statutory amounts deducted from our production revenues by various state taxing entities. Depending on the regulations of the states where the production originates, these taxes may be based on a percentage of the realized value or a fixed amount per production unit. This category also includes the costs to process and transport our production to applicable sales points. Ad valorem taxes are jurisdictional taxes levied on the value of oil and natural gas minerals and reserves. Rates, methods of calculating property values, and timing of payments vary between taxing authorities. For the year ended December 31, 2015, production and ad valorem taxes decreased over the year ended December 31, 2014, generally as a result of lower realized commodity prices and estimated mineral reserve valuations.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and cash available for distribution to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the periods indicated.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Related Estimates\nFactors Affecting the Comparability of Our Financial Results\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nGeneral and administrative. For the year ended December 31, 2014, general and administrative expenses increased as compared to 2013 primarily due to higher personnel costs and costs attributable to our long-term incentive plans. While our overall general and administrative expenses increased for 2014, our 2014 legal and broker fees were lower due to nonrecurring costs incurred to consummate our 2013 exchange offer and a one-time acquisition-related broker fee payment incurred in the prior period.\nCommodity Prices\nOperating Expenses\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nAt the beginning of each calendar year, we establish a capital budget and then monitor it throughout the year. Our capital budgets are created based upon our estimate of internally generated cash flows and the ability to borrow and raise additional capital. Actual capital expenditure levels will vary, in part, based on actual internally generated cash, actual wells proposed by our operators for our participation, and the successful closing of acquisitions. The timing, size, and nature of acquisitions are unpredictable.\nVolumes of Oil and Natural Gas Produced\nThe effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nThe following table reflects commodity prices at the end of each of the four quarters for the most recently completed fiscal year:\nQuality differentials result from the heating value of natural gas measured in Btus and the presence of impurities, such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen. Natural gas containing ethane and heavier hydrocarbons has a higher Btu value and will realize a higher volumetric price than natural gas made up of predominantly methane, which has a lower Btu value. Natural gas with a higher concentration of impurities will realize a lower volumetric price due to the presence of the impurities in the natural gas when sold or the cost of treating the natural gas to meet pipeline quality specifications.\nHedging\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nWe enter into derivative instruments to partially mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility on our cash generated from operations. From time to time, such instruments may include fixed-price swaps, costless collars, fixed-price contracts, and other contractual arrangements. We currently employ a rolling hedge\u201d strategy whereby we hedge a significant portion of our proved developed producing reserves 18 to 24 months into the future. The impact of these derivative instruments could affect the amount of revenue we ultimately realize. Throughout 2014, we entered into costless collars to allow us the ability to participate in upward movements in commodity prices while also setting a price floor for a portion of our production. Costless collars are a combination of a purchased put option and a sold call option, in which the premiums paid and received net to zero. During the fourth quarter of 2014 and all of 2015, we also entered into fixed-price swap contracts. Under fixed-price swap contracts, a counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is less than the swap strike price; conversely, we are required to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is greater than the swap strike price. We may employ contractual arrangements other than costless collars and fixed-price swap contracts in the future to mitigate the impact of price fluctuations. If commodity prices decline in the future, our hedging contracts will partially mitigate the effect of lower prices on our future revenue.\nOutstanding borrowings under the third amended and restated credit facility bear interest at a floating rate elected by us equal to an alternative base rate (which is equal to the greatest of the Prime rate, the Federal Funds effective rate plus 0.5%, or 1-month LIBOR plus 1.0%) or LIBOR, in each case plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin ranges from 0.50% to 1.50% in the case of the alternative base rate and from 1.50% to 2.50% in the case of LIBOR, in each case depending on the amount of borrowings outstanding in relation to the borrowing base. We are obligated to pay a quarterly commitment fee ranging from 0.375% to 0.500% per year on the unused portion of the borrowing base, depending on the amount of the borrowings outstanding in relation to the borrowing base. Principal may be optionally repaid from time to time without premium or penalty, other than customary LIBOR breakage, and is required to be paid (a) if the amount outstanding exceeds the borrowing base, whether due to a borrowing base redetermination or otherwise, in some cases subject to a cure period or (b) at the maturity date. The third amended and restated credit facility is secured by liens on substantially all of our properties.\nOur financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented may not be comparable, either from period to period or going forward, because we will incur higher general and administrative expenses than in prior periods as a result of operating as a publicly traded partnership. These incremental expenses include costs associated with SEC reporting requirements, including annual and quarterly reports to unitholders; tax return and Schedule K-1 preparation and distribution; Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance; New York Stock Exchange listing fees; independent registered public accounting firm fees; legal fees, investor-relations activities, registrar and transfer agent fees; director-and-officer insurance; and additional compensation. These direct, incremental general and administrative expenses are not included in our historical results of operations for periods prior to our IPO.\nRig Count\nSuccessful Efforts Method of Accounting\nCash Flows\nAt December 31, 2015, we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nInterest expense. Interest expense increased due to additional borrowings under our credit facility. Outstanding borrowings during 2014 were higher than 2013, primarily due to increased expenditures for acquisitions, drilling activity, and common equity repurchases during 2013.\nLease operating expense. Lease operating expense was substantially consistent between periods.\nOperating Expenses\nFair values of legal obligations to retire and remove long-lived assets are recorded when the obligation is incurred and becomes determinable. When the liability is initially recorded, we capitalize this cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related property and equipment. Over time, the liability is accreted for the change in its present value, and the capitalized cost in oil and natural gas properties is depleted based on units of production consistent with the related asset.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n \u00b7 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and cash available for distribution. \nThe information below is designed to give a broad overview of the oil and natural gas business environment as it affects us.\nyear ended December 31, 2014, our cash expenditures for acquisitions totaled $45.6 million versus $121.6 million for the same period in 2013. Capital expenditures for our working interests, net of sale proceeds, decreased by $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 versus the comparable period of 2013.\nSince we are not an operator, drilling on our acreage is dependent upon the exploration and production companies that lease our acreage. In addition to drilling plans that we seek from our operators, we monitor rig counts in an effort to identify existing and future leasing and drilling activity on our acreage.\nOther exploratory costs, including annual delay rentals and geological and geophysical costs, are expensed when incurred. Mineral and royalty interests and working interests are recorded at cost at the time of acquisition. Upon sale or retirement of depreciable or depletable property, the cost and related accumulated DD&A are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is recognized.\nWe use the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and natural gas operations. Under this method, costs to acquire interests in oil and natural gas properties are capitalized. The cost of property acquisitions, successful exploratory wells, development costs, and support equipment and facilities are initially capitalized when incurred. DD&A of producing oil and natural gas properties is recorded based on a units-of-production methodology. Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized on the basis of all proved reserves, developed and undeveloped, and capitalized development costs are amortized on the basis of proved developed reserves. Proved reserves are quantities of oil and natural gas that can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. A sustained low price environment could decrease our estimate of proved reserves, which would increase the rate at which we record depletion expense and reduce net income. Additionally, a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our assessment of producing properties for impairment. We are unable to predict future commodity prices with any greater precision than the futures market. The impact of commodity prices can be illustrated as follows. If we assumed the average 12-month forward strip pricing as of December 31, 2015 was held constant in determining our reserves, our estimated proved reserves on a Boe basis as of December 31, 2015 would have declined by approximately 2%.\nDuring 2015, we spent approximately $63.2 million on eight acquisitions. We also incurred approximately $60.1 million related to drilling and completion costs, the majority of which was in the Haynesville/Bossier, Bakken/Three Forks, and Wilcox plays. Our 2016 capital budget for drilling expenditures is approximately $60.0 million. Approximately 95% of our drilling capital budget will be spent in the Haynesville/Bossier and Bakken/Three Forks plays, respectively, with the remainder spent in various plays including the Wolfcamp and Wilcox plays.\nImpairment of oil and natural gas properties. Individual categories of oil and natural gas properties are assessed periodically to determine if the net book value for these properties has been impaired. Management periodically conducts an in-depth evaluation of the cost of property acquisitions, successful exploratory wells, development activities, unproved leasehold, and mineral interests to identify impairments. Impairments for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 primarily resulted from changes in reserve values due to declines in future expected realized net cash flows as a result of lower commodity prices.\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of our accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. The following discussions of critical accounting estimates, including any related discussion of contingencies, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions could be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. We have provided expanded discussion of our more significant accounting estimates below.\nResults of Operations\nNatural gas, which currently has a limited global transportation system, is subject to price variances based on local supply and demand conditions and the cost to transport natural gas to end user markets.\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations, borrowings under our credit facility, and proceeds from any future issuances of equity and debt. Our primary uses of cash are for distributions to our unitholders and for investing in our\nOn November 6, 2015, we commenced a tender offer to purchase up to 100% of the 117,963 then outstanding preferred units from our preferred unitholders at the units' par value of $1,000.00 per preferred unit, plus unpaid accrued yield. The tender offer expired on December 10, 2015. We purchased and cancelled 40,747 preferred units, representing 34.5% of our then outstanding preferred units. The preferred units were purchased at a purchase price of $1,019.45 per preferred unit for a total cost of approximately $41.5 million, excluding fees and expenses relating to the tender offer.\nThe following table shows our production, revenues, and expenses for the periods presented:\nIn order to assess and track the performance of our assets, we monitor and analyze production volumes from the various basins and plays that comprise our extensive asset base. We also regularly compare projected volumes to actual reported volumes and investigate unexpected variations.\n As a mineral-and-royalty-interest owner, we are often provided insufficient and inconsistent data by our operators. As a result, we are unable to reliably determine the total volumes of NGLs associated with the production of natural gas on our acreage. As such, the realized prices account for all sales attributable to NGLs. The oil and condensate production volumes and natural gas production volumes do not include NGL volumes. \nDerivative instruments are recognized at fair value. If a right of offset exists under master netting arrangements and certain other criteria are met, derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are netted on the consolidated balance sheet. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized on a net basis in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations within gain (loss) on commodity derivative instruments. Although these derivative instruments may expose us to credit risk, we monitor the creditworthiness of our counterparties.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth under Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\n \u00b7 Natural Gas. The NYMEX price quoted at Henry Hub is a widely used benchmark for the pricing of natural gas in the United States. The actual volumetric prices realized from the sale of natural gas differ from the quoted NYMEX price as a result of quality and location differentials. \nWe recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. Revenues are considered realized or realizable and earned when: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. We recognize oil and natural gas revenue from our interests in producing wells when the associated production is sold. To the extent actual volumes and prices of oil and natural gas are unavailable for a given reporting period because of timing or information not received from third parties, the expected sales volume and prices for these properties are estimated and recorded within accounts receivable. Crude oil is priced on the delivery date based upon prevailing prices published by purchasers with certain adjustments related to oil quality and physical location. Natural gas contracts' pricing provisions are tied to a market index, with certain adjustments based on, among other factors, whether a well delivers to a gathering or transmission line, quality and heat content of natural gas, and prevailing supply and demand conditions, so that the price of natural gas fluctuates to remain competitive with other available natural gas supplies. These market indices are determined on a monthly basis.\nOperating Activities. For the year ended December 31, 2014, cash flows from operating activities increased by $75.4 million as compared to the same period in 2013 due to increased realized natural gas prices, higher oil and condensate volumes, and higher lease bonus revenue.\nThe chemical composition of crude oil plays an important role in its refining and subsequent sale as petroleum products. As a result, variations in chemical composition relative to the benchmark crude oil, usually WTI, will result in price adjustments, which are often referred to as quality differentials. The characteristics that most significantly affect quality differentials include the density of the oil, as characterized by its API gravity, and the presence and concentration of impurities, such as sulfur.\n\nUnder various contracts, permits, and regulations, we have legal obligations to restore the land at the end of operations at certain properties where we own non-operated working interests. Estimating the future restoration costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult. Most of these restoration obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what practices and criteria must be met when the event actually occurs. Asset-restoration technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into the valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change.\nDerivatives and Financial Instruments\nThe following table shows natural gas storage volumes by region at the end of each of the four quarters for the most recently completed fiscal year:\nPrior to our initial public offering, the board of directors of our Predecessor determined the fair value of unit-based awards by considering various objective and subjective factors, along with input from management, and using the same methodology as required under our Predecessor's partnership agreement for purposes of repurchasing Predecessor common units from those limited partners who exercise their right to annually sell a portion of their units. To determine the fair value of the unit-based awards, the board of directors of our Predecessor considered information provided by third-party consultants and relied on generally accepted valuation techniques, which included the net asset value method under the asset approach, the guideline public company method under the market approach, and the dividend discount method of the income approach. Estimates of value using the net asset value method were derived using assumptions including commodity prices, estimated development timing of our acreage, and market-based discount rates. The value conclusion using the guideline public company method was estimated by considering peer company performance metrics, comparability of the peer company portfolio and risk profiles, and implied forward distribution yields and multiples. To estimate the value of the awards using the transaction method, publicly available data related to acquisitions of mineral properties and applied the implied deal metrics to our performance measures were reviewed. The dividend discount method was developed based on assumptions including our projected distributions, anticipated long-term distribution growth rates, and near- and long-term cost of capital estimates. In determining the fair value of the awards, the board of directors of our Predecessor also considered our historical transactions and performance in making these estimates.\nSource: Baker Hughes Incorporated\nTotal revenue. The increase in total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 was made up of $43.2 million from commodity derivative instruments, $23.8 million resulting from higher production volumes, $14.3 million from higher lease bonus, and $3.4 million from higher realized commodity prices.\ninterest production made up 67.3% and 67.8% of our natural gas volumes for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOil and natural gas prices have been historically volatile based upon the dynamics of supply and demand. During 2015, oil and natural gas prices have remained significantly below prices seen over the past five years as global concerns of long-term supply imbalances and slowing demand growth have continued to weigh on prices. West Texas Intermediate ( WTI\u201d) spot prices ranged from a low of $34.55 per Bbl on December 21, 2015 to a high of $61.36 per Bbl on June 10, 2015. Oil prices have continued to be pressured downward following the end of the year, reaching a low of $26.19 per Bbl on February 11, 2016. During 2015, Henry Hub spot natural gas prices ranged from a low of $1.63 per MMBtu on December 23, 2015 to a high of $3.32 per MMBtu on January 15, 2015. The Henry Hub spot price closed at $1.62 per MMBtu on February 29, 2016. To manage the variability in cash flows associated with the projected sale of our oil and natural gas production, we use various derivative instruments, which have generally consisted of fixed-price swaps and costless collars.\n \u00b7 volumes of oil and natural gas produced; \nThe prices we receive for oil, natural gas, and NGLs vary by geographical area. The relative prices of these products are determined by the factors affecting global and regional supply and demand dynamics, such as economic conditions, production levels, availability of transportation, weather cycles, and other factors. In addition, realized prices are influenced by product quality and proximity to consuming and refining markets. Any differences between realized prices and NYMEX prices are referred to as differentials. All of our production is derived from properties located in the United States. As a result of our geographic diversification, we are not exposed to concentrated differential risks associated with any single play, trend, or basin.\nBusiness Environment\n\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and cash available for distribution are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures used by our management and external users of our financial statements such as investors, research analysts, and others, to assess the financial performance of our assets and our ability to sustain distributions over the long term without regard to financing methods, capital structure, or historical cost basis.\nGain on commodity derivative instruments. In 2015, we recognized $57.7 million of gains from oil commodity contracts, of which $15.9 million were realized, compared to $27.5 million of combined gains in 2014, virtually all of which were unrealized. In 2015, we recognized $32.6 million of gains from natural gas commodity contracts, of which $11.2 million were unrealized, compared to $9.8 million of net gains in 2014, of which $11.8 million were unrealized gains.\nDuring 2014, we spent $45.6 million on three cash acquisitions and completed another acquisition for $2.3 million with an issuance of equity securities. In 2014, we spent approximately $67.7 million on drilling and completion costs.\nExploration expense. Exploration expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased from the same period in 2013 due to costs related to a dry hole that was drilled during 2014.\nThe following table shows the rig count at the end of each of the four quarters for the most recently completed fiscal year:\nContractual Obligations\nRevenues\nThe third amended and restated credit agreement contains various affirmative, negative, and financial maintenance covenants. These covenants, among other things, limit additional indebtedness, additional liens, sales of assets, mergers and consolidations, dividends and distributions, transactions with affiliates and entering into certain swap agreements, as well as require the maintenance of certain financial ratios. The third amended and restated credit agreement contains two financial covenants: total debt to EBITDAX of 3.5:1.0 or less; and a modified current ratio of 1.0:1.0 or greater. Distributions are not permitted if there is a default under the third amended and restated credit agreement (including due to a failure to satisfy one of the financial covenants) or during any time that our borrowing base is lower than the loans outstanding under the third amended and restated credit facility. The lenders have the right to accelerate all of the indebtedness under the third amended and restated credit facility upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any event of default, and the third amended and restated credit agreement contains customary events of default, including non-payment, breach of covenants, materially incorrect representations, cross-default, bankruptcy, and change of control. There are no cure periods for events of default due to non-payment of principal and breaches of negative and financial covenants, but non-payment of interest and breaches of certain affirmative covenants are subject to customary cure periods. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.\nWe use a variety of operational and financial measures to assess our performance. Among the measures considered by management are the following:\nThe following table summarizes our minimum payments as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nImpairment of oil and natural gas properties. Impairments totaled $117.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to changes in reserve values resulting from the drop in commodity prices and other factors. Impairments totaled $57.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to the impact that changes in price had on the value of our reserve estimates.\nHistorically, natural gas supply and demand fluctuates on a seasonal basis. From April to October, when the weather is warmer and natural gas demand is lower, natural gas storage levels generally increase. From November to March, storage levels typically decline as utility companies draw natural gas from storage to meet increased heating demand due to colder weather. In order to maintain sufficient storage levels for increased seasonal demand, a portion of natural gas production during the summer months must be used for storage injection. The portion of production used for storage varies from year to year depending on the demand from the previous winter and the demand for electricity used for cooling during the summer months.\nAcquisitions\nWe evaluate impairment of producing properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We estimate the undiscounted future cash flows expected in connection with the properties and compare such undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable. When the carrying amount of a property exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, the carrying amount is reduced to its fair value. Fair value is calculated as the present value of estimated future discounted cash flows of such properties. The factors used to determine fair value include estimates of proved reserves, future commodity prices, timing of future production, future capital expenditures, and a risk-adjusted discount rate. The markets for oil and natural gas have a history of significant price volatility. However, a sustained low price environment could result in lower NYMEX forward strip prices and lower estimates of future cash flows expected from our properties. Such decrease in cash flow estimates could result in recording additional impairment for our properties if such circumstances indicated the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.\n \u00b7 commodity prices including the effect of hedges; and \n\nOn January 23, 2015, we amended and restated our $1.0 billion senior secured revolving credit agreement. Under this third amended and restated credit facility, the commitment of the lenders equals the lesser of the aggregate maximum credit amounts of the lenders or the borrowing base, which is determined based on the lenders' estimated value of our oil and natural gas properties. On October 28, 2015, the third amended and restated credit facility was further amended to extend the term of the agreement from February 3, 2017 to February 4, 2019. Borrowings under the third amended and restated credit facility may be used for the acquisition of properties, cash distributions, and other general corporate purposes. Our semi-annual borrowing base redetermination process resulted in a decrease of the borrowing base from $600.0 million to $550.0 million, effective October 28, 2015. Our next borrowing base redetermination is scheduled for April 2016. As of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding borrowings of $66.0 million at a weighted-average interest rate of 1.92%. We used net proceeds from our IPO in May 2015 to repay substantially all indebtedness then outstanding under our third amended and restated credit facility.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and cash available for distribution should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, cash flows from operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP as measures of our financial performance. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and cash available for distribution have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Our computation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and cash available for distribution may differ from computations of similarly titled measures of other companies.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n As a mineral-and-royalty-interest owner, we are often provided insufficient and inconsistent data by our operators. As a result, we are unable to reliably determine the total volumes of NGLs associated with the production of natural gas on our acreage. As such, the realized prices account for all sales attributable to NGLs. The oil and condensate production volumes and natural gas production volumes do not include NGL volumes. \nCommodity Prices\nNew and Revised Financial Accounting Standards\nWe recognize equity-based compensation expense for unit-based awards granted to our employees and the board of directors of our general partner. Total compensation expense for unit-based awards is calculated based on the number of units granted multiplied by the grant-date fair value per unit. Compensation expense for time-based restricted unit awards with graded vesting requirements are recognized using straight-line attribution over the requisite service period. Compensation expense related to the restricted performance unit awards is determined by multiplying the number of common units underlying such awards that, based on our estimates, are likely to vest, by the grant-date fair value and recognized using the accelerated attribution method. Equity-based compensation expense related to unit-based awards is included in general and administrative expense within the consolidated statements of operations. Distribution equivalent rights for the restricted performance unit awards that are expected to vest are charged to partners' capital. Please read Note 10 - Incentive Compensation within the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information.\nThe costs of unproved leaseholds and mineral interests are capitalized as unproved properties pending the results of exploration efforts. As unproved leaseholds are determined to be proved, the related costs are transferred to proved properties. Unproved and non-producing property costs are assessed periodically, on a property-by-property basis, and an impairment loss is recognized to the extent, if any, the recorded value has been impaired. Mineral interests are recorded at cost at the time of acquisition. Mineral interests are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. This assessment is performed by comparing carrying values to valuation estimates and impairment is recognized to the extent that book value exceeds estimated recoverable value. Any impairment will generally be based on geographic or geologic data and our estimated future cash flows related to our properties.\nOn March 4, 2016, the board of directors of our general partner authorized the repurchase of up to $50.0 million in common units over the next six months. The repurchase program authorizes us to make repurchases on a discretionary basis as determined by management, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, available liquidity, and other appropriate factors. All or a portion of any repurchases may be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which would permit common units to be repurchased when we might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws. The repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common units and may be modified or suspended at any time and could be terminated prior to completion. We will periodically report the number of common units repurchased. The repurchase program will be funded from our cash on hand or available revolving credit facility. Any repurchased common units will be cancelled.\nLocation differentials generally result from transportation costs based on the produced oil's proximity to consuming and refining markets and major
