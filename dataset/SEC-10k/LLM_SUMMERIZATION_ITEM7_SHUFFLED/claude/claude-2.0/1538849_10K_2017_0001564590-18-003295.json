MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following MD&A is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. This section is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with Items 1., 1A. and 8.

Circle K is a wholly owned subsidiary of Couche-Tard.\nAs a result of the Merger, Circle K indirectly owns all of the membership interests in the sole member of our General Partner, as well as a 21.1% limited partner interest in the Partnership and all of the outstanding IDRs of the Partnership. Circle K, through its indirect ownership interest in the sole member of our General Partner, has the ability to appoint all of the members of the Board and to control and manage the operations and activities of the Partnership.\nSignificant Factors Affecting our Profitability\nThe Significance of Crude Oil and Wholesale Motor Fuel Prices on Our Revenues, Cost of Sales and Gross Profit\nWholesale segment\nThe prices paid to our motor fuel suppliers for wholesale motor fuel (which affects our cost of sales) are highly correlated to the price of crude oil. The crude oil commodity markets are highly volatile, and the market prices of crude oil, and, correspondingly, the market prices of wholesale motor fuel, experience significant and rapid fluctuations. We receive a fixed mark-up per gallon on approximately 85% of gallons sold to our customers. The remaining gallons are primarily DTW priced contracts with our customers. These contracts provide for variable, market based pricing that results in motor fuel gross profit effects similar to retail motor fuel gross profits (as crude oil prices decline, motor fuel gross profit generally increases, as discussed in our Retail segment below). The increase in DTW gross profit results from the acquisition cost of wholesale motor fuel declining at a faster rate as compared to the rate retail motor fuel prices decline. Conversely, our DTW motor fuel gross profit declines when the cost of wholesale motor fuel increases at a faster rate as compared to the rate retail motor fuel prices increase.\nCrossAmerica purchases motor fuel for our Jet-Pep Assets from Circle K at Circle K's cost plus terminal and administration fees of $0.015 per gallon. Circle K's cost to supply these sites includes price fluctuations associated with index-based motor fuel pricing for pipeline delivery and the generation and sale of RINs. Circle K has implemented a motor fuel price hedging program to mitigate the price risk during delivery; however, we are exposed to more price risk with these motor fuel purchases from Circle K as compared to our other motor fuel purchases.\nRegarding our supplier relationships, a majority of our total gallons purchased are subject to Terms Discounts. The dollar value of these discounts increases and decreases corresponding to motor fuel prices. Therefore, in periods of lower wholesale motor fuel prices, our gross profit is negatively affected and, in periods of higher wholesale motor fuel prices, our gross profit is positively affected (as it relates to these discounts).\nRetail segment\nWe attempt to pass along wholesale motor fuel price changes to our retail customers through at the pump\u201d retail price changes; however, market conditions do not always allow us to do so immediately. The timing of any related increase or decrease in at the pump\u201d retail prices is affected by competitive conditions in each geographic market in which we operate. As such, the prices we charge our customers for motor fuel and the gross profit we receive on our motor fuel sales can increase or decrease significantly over short periods of time.\nChanges in our average motor fuel selling price per gallon and gross margin are directly related to the changes in crude oil and wholesale motor fuel prices. Variations in our reported revenues and cost of sales are, therefore, primarily related to the price of crude oil and wholesale motor fuel prices and generally not as a result of changes in motor fuel sales volumes, unless otherwise indicated and discussed below.\nWe typically experience lower retail motor fuel gross profits in periods when the wholesale cost of motor fuel increases, and higher retail motor fuel gross profits in periods when the wholesale cost of motor fuel declines.\nSeasonality Effects on Volumes\nOur business is subject to seasonality due to our wholesale and retail sites being located in certain geographic areas that are affected by seasonal weather and temperature trends and associated changes in retail customer activity during different seasons. Historically, sales volumes have been highest in the second and third quarters (during the summer months) and lowest during the winter months in the first and fourth quarters.\nImpact of Inflation\nInflation affects our financial performance by increasing certain of our operating expenses and cost of goods sold. Operating expenses include labor costs, leases, and general and administrative expenses. While our Wholesale segment benefits from higher Terms Discounts as a result of higher fuel costs, inflation could negatively impact our Retail segment as a result of higher motor fuel, merchandise and operating costs. Although we have historically been able to pass on increased costs through price increases, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future.\nAcquisition and Financing Activity\nOur results of operations and financial condition are also impacted by our acquisition and financing activities as summarized below.\nTable 199: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> In January 2015, we closed on the purchase of a 5% limited partner equity interest in CST Fuel Supply for approximately 1.5 million common units with an aggregate consideration of $60.0 million on the date of closing.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> In January 2015, in connection with the joint acquisition by CST and the Partnership of 22 retail sites from Landmark Assets, we acquired the real property of the 22 fee sites for $41.2 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 201: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> In February 2015, we closed on the purchase of all of the outstanding capital stock of Erickson and certain related assets for an aggregate purchase price of $83.8 million, including working capital.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> In June 2015, we closed on the sale of 4.6 million common units for net proceeds of approximately $138.5 million.

Such costs are included in general and administrative expenses and were primarily paid by Circle K in the third quarter of 2017. Accounts payable to related parties includes these costs as we will reimburse Circle K.\nIn addition, certain participants in the EICP received retention bonuses that will be paid in annual installments that began in July 2017 and will continue through July 2019. The Partnership recorded a $1.0 million charge during 2017 in connection with the payments made by Circle K in July 2017, which were included in general and administrative expenses. In addition, the Partnership recognized a $0.7 million charge in 2017 for the payments expected to be made in July 2018 and July 2019. The Partnership anticipates recognizing future charges totaling $0.9 million over the remaining retention period, of which $0.8 million is anticipated to be recognized in 2018.\nWe were a co-defendant, together with our General Partner, CST and CST Services LLC, in a lawsuit brought by a former executive of CST Services who, until March 2015, provided services to us as Chief Investment Officer and Vice President of Finance (Court of Common Pleas, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, case number 2015-1003). In connection with CST's acquisition of our General Partner in 2014, the plaintiff alleged breach of contract and associated claims relating to his termination of employment and claimed severance benefits under the EICP. In October 2017, a jury awarded the plaintiff a total of $1.7 million. Under the EICP, we were also obligated to pay reasonable legal expenses incurred by the plaintiff in connection with this dispute.\nAcquisition of Jet-Pep Assets\nOn November 28, 2017, we closed on the acquisition of the real property and the fuel supply business of 101 commission operated retail sites, including 92 fee simple sites, the leasehold interest in five real property sites and the fuel supply business to four independent commission sites, all located in Alabama, from Jet-Pep, Inc. and affiliated entities, for an aggregate cash consideration of $75.6 million, including working capital. On the same day, Circle K closed on the acquisition of certain related retail and terminal assets from Jet-Pep, Inc. and affiliated entities.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Income Statement Analysis\nBelow is an analysis of our consolidated statements of income and provides the primary reasons for significant increases and decreases in the various income statement line items from period to period.

Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA as further adjusted to exclude equity funded expenses related to incentive compensation and the Amended Omnibus Agreement, gains or losses on sales of assets, certain discrete acquisition related costs, such as legal and other professional fees and severance expenses associated with recently acquired companies, and certain other discrete non-cash items arising from purchase accounting. Distributable Cash Flow represents Adjusted EBITDA less cash interest expense, sustaining capital expenditures and current income tax expense. Distribution Coverage Ratio is computed by dividing Distributable Cash Flow by the weighted average diluted common and subordinated units and then dividing that result by the distributions paid per limited partner unit.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio are used as supplemental financial measures by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors and lenders. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used to assess our financial performance without regard to financing methods, capital structure or income taxes and the ability to incur and service debt and to fund capital expenditures. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is used to assess the operating performance of our business on a consistent basis by excluding the impact of items which do not result directly from the wholesale distribution of motor fuel, the leasing of real property, or the day to day operations of our retail site activities. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio are also used to assess the ability to generate cash sufficient to make distributions to our unitholders.\nWe believe the presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio provides useful information to investors in assessing the financial condition and results of operations. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio should not be considered alternatives to net income or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income. Additionally, because EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\nThe following table presents reconciliations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Distributable Cash Flow to net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, for each of the periods indicated (in thousands, except for per unit amounts):\nTable 246: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

We expect our ongoing sources of liquidity to include cash generated by our operations and borrowings under the revolving credit facility and, if available to us on acceptable terms, issuances of equity and debt securities. We regularly evaluate alternate sources of capital, including sale-leaseback financing of real property with third parties, to support our liquidity requirements.\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations and other capital requirements, including capital expenditures, acquisitions, and partnership distributions, will depend on our future operating performance, which, in turn, will be subject to general economic, financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other conditions, many of which are beyond our control. As a normal part of our business, depending on market conditions, we will, from time to time, consider opportunities to repay, redeem, repurchase or refinance our indebtedness. Changes in our operating plans, lower than anticipated sales, increased expenses, acquisitions or other events may cause us to seek additional debt or equity financing in future periods.\nWe believe that we will have sufficient cash flow from operations, borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility and access to capital markets and alternate sources of funding to meet our financial commitments, debt service obligations, contingencies, anticipated capital expenditures and partnership distributions. However, we are subject to business and operational risks that could adversely affect our cash flow. A material decrease in our cash flows would likely produce an adverse effect on our borrowing capacity as well as our ability to issue additional equity and/or debt securities.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes cash flow activity (in thousands):\nTable 253: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 88,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 79,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 64,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (60,113\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (96,906\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (311,518\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (26,300\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 233,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $9.5 million for 2017 compared to 2016, driven primarily by incremental cash flow generated by our March 2016 Franchised Holiday Stores, September 2016 State Oil Assets and November 2017 Jet-Pep Assets acquisitions. In addition, we paid $1.1 million more of the management fees related to the services provided under the Amended Omnibus Agreement in common units issued to CST (pre-Merger) and Circle K (post-Merger) in 2017 compared to 2016.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $15.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015, driven primarily by incremental cash flow generated by our acquisitions. In addition, we settled $3.2 million more in management fees in equity with CST in 2016 compared to 2015.\nInvesting Activities\nIn 2017, we paid $75.6 million in the Jet-Pep Assets acquisition and incurred $12.5 million in capital expenditures. In addition, we received $27.6 million of proceeds on sales, largely driven by the sale of 29 properties to DMR and two properties sold as a result of the FTC's requirements associated with the Merger.\nIn 2016, we paid $94.2 million in the Franchised Holiday Stores and State Oil Assets acquisitions and $2.9 million for independent dealer and sub-wholesaler contracts purchased from CST. We also incurred $20.8 million of capital expenditures and received $17.5 million in proceeds from the refund payment related to CST's sale of the California and Wyoming assets.\nIn 2015, we paid $167.8 million in the Landmark Assets, Erickson and One Stop acquisitions and $141.9 million on the acquisitions of CST's NTIs and CST Fuel Supply equity interests. We also had $10.2 million in capital expenditures.\nFinancing Activities\nIn 2017, we paid $88.2 million in distributions and made net borrowings on our credit facility of $64.5 million.\nIn 2016, we paid $83.6 million in distributions and purchased $3.3 million in common units under our common unit purchase program. We received $25.0 million in proceeds on the sale-leaseback transaction and had $83.1 million in net borrowings under our credit facility to fund our acquisitions.\nIn 2015, we received $144.9 million in net proceeds on equity offerings and $158.0 million in net borrowings under our credit facility to fund our acquisitions. We paid $66.1 million in distributions and purchased $3.6 million in common units under our common unit purchase program.\nRefund payment related to CST sale of California and Wyoming assets\nOn July 7, 2016, in connection with the divestiture of certain California and Wyoming assets and the related decrease in supplied fuel volumes and as approved by the independent conflicts committee of the Board, CST provided a refund payment to the purchase price paid by us for our interest in CST Fuel Supply. The total refund payment received by us was approximately $18.2 million. See Note 12 to the financial statements for additional information.\nDistributions\nDistribution activity for 2017 was as follows:\nTable 254: <table> <tr> <td> Quarter Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Record Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payment Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cash Distribution\n(per unit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cash Distribution\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> February 6, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> February 13, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.6125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> March 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> May 8, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> May 15, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.6175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> June 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> August 7, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> August 14, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.6225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> September 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> November 6, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> November 13, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.6275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> February 5, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> February 12, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.6275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe amount of any distribution is subject to the discretion of the Board, which may modify or revoke our cash distribution policy at any time. Our Partnership Agreement does not require us to pay any distributions. As such, there can be no assurance we will continue to pay distributions in the future.\nIDRs\nWe distributed $4.3 million and $3.4 million to CST and Circle K with respect to the IDRs in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nExpiration of the Subordination Period\nIn accordance with the terms of the Partnership Agreement, on February 25, 2016, the first business day after the payment of the fourth quarter 2015 distribution of $0.5925 per unit, the subordination period under the Partnership Agreement ended. At that time, each of the 7,525,000 outstanding subordinated units converted into one common unit and now participates in distributions pro rata with other common units.\nDebt\nAs of December 31, 2017, our consolidated debt and capital lease obligations consisted of the following (in thousands):\nTable 255: <table> <tr> <td> $550 million revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 506,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Note payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total debt and capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 533,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current portion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noncurrent portion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 531,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred financing costs, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noncurrent portion, net of deferred financing costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 529,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur revolving credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets. Our borrowings under the revolving credit facility had a weighted-average interest rate of 4.44% as of December 31, 2017 (LIBOR plus an applicable margin, which was 3.00% as of December 31, 2017). Letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2017 totaled $6.7 million. The amount of availability under the revolving credit facility at February 21, 2018, after taking into consideration debt covenant restrictions, was $17.6 million. In connection with future acquisitions, the revolving credit facility requires, among other things, that we have, after giving effect to such acquisition, at least $20 million in the aggregate of borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and unrestricted cash on the balance sheet on the date of such acquisition. We are required to maintain a total leverage ratio (as defined in the revolving credit facility) for the most recently completed four fiscal quarters of less than or equal to 4.50 : 1.00, except for the quarter in which a material acquisition occurs and the first three full fiscal quarters following a material acquisition, generally defined as an acquisition with a purchase price of at least $30.0 million, with a ratio of 5.00 : 1.00, and a consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the revolving credit facility) of greater than or equal to 2.75 : 1.00. The computation of our total leverage ratio allows for a pro forma application of the EBITDA (as defined in the revolving credit facility) of acquired entities and was 4.14 : 1.00 as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with these financial covenant ratios.\nRenegotiation of Rocky Top Purchase Obligation\nIn connection with the Rocky Top acquisition that we completed in September 2013, we entered into a deferred seller financing arrangement, which obligated us to purchase certain sites over a 5-year period for an average $5.2 million per year beginning in 2016 at an approximately 7.7% capitalization rate. In June 2016, we renegotiated the terms with the sellers, eliminating the deferred seller financing obligation and agreeing to terms of a new lease of the assets for an initial term of 15 years and eight months with four renewal options of five years each. Under this triple net lease, annual rent is initially $1.8 million based on a 6.5% capitalization rate and increases 1.5% per year. However, because of the continuing involvement we have with the sites through the lease and sublease of the properties, we recorded the liability on our balance sheet at fair value in June 2016, which approximated its carrying value. This sale-leaseback liability is classified within accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on the balance sheet.\nSale Leaseback Transaction\nIn December 2016, we sold the real property at 17 sites acquired through the State Oil Assets asset acquisition for cash proceeds of $25.0 million, which were used to repay borrowings on the credit facility. We leased these properties for an initial term of 15 years with three renewal options of approximately five years each. Under the triple net lease, annual rent is initially $1.6 million based on a 6.5% capitalization rate and increases every five years based on inflation. Because of the continuing involvement we have with the sites through the lease and sublease of the properties, we recorded a liability for the proceeds received and are amortizing this liability over the lease term as rent payments are made. This sale-leaseback liability is classified within accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on the balance sheet.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe make investments to expand, upgrade and enhance existing assets. We categorize our capital requirements as either sustaining capital expenditures, growth capital expenditures or acquisition capital expenditures. Sustaining capital expenditures are those capital expenditures required to maintain our long-term operating income or operating capacity. Acquisition and growth capital expenditures are those capital expenditures that we expect will increase our operating income or operating capacity over the long term. We have the ability to fund our capital expenditures by additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility or, if available to us on acceptable terms, issuing additional equity, debt securities or other options, such as the sale of assets. With the significant decline in energy prices since 2014, access to the capital markets has tightened for the energy and MLP industries as a whole, which has impacted our cost of capital and our ability to raise equity and debt financing at favorable terms. Our ability to access the capital markets may have an impact on our ability to fund acquisitions. We may not be able to complete any offering of securities or other options on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nThe following table outlines our capital expenditures and acquisitions for 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 256: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

related to our credit facility assuming a 4.5% interest rate.\nCapital Lease Obligations\nWe have certain retail site properties under capital leases. Capital lease obligations in the table above include both principal and interest.\nOperating Lease Obligations\nThe operating lease obligations include leases for land, office facilities and retail sites. Operating lease obligations reflected in the table above include all operating leases that have initial or remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases. In addition, such amounts do not reflect contingent rentals that may be incurred in addition to minimum rentals.\nOur principal executive offices are in Allentown, Pennsylvania, in an office space leased by Circle K, for which the rent is charged to us as a cost under the Amended Omnibus Agreement. Future lease payments on this office lease are included within operating lease obligations.\nSale Leaseback Obligations\nThe payments in the table above represent payments on sale-leaseback transactions for which the sale was not recognized as a result of the continuing involvement with the sites. As such, the table above includes the payments under the lease.\nManagement Fees\nThe payments in the table above represent contractually obligated payments under the Amended Omnibus Agreement. See Note 12 to the financial statements for additional information.\nOther Liabilities\nOther liabilities include asset retirement obligations described in Note 10 to the financial statements and exclude other liabilities whose payment period or amount is not determinable. For purposes of reflecting amounts for asset retirement obligations in the table above, we have made our best estimate of expected payments based on information available as of December 31, 2017.\nUnder the terms of various supply agreements, the Partnership is obligated to minimum volume purchases measured in gallons of motor fuel. Future minimum volume purchase requirements are 347 million gallons in 2018, reducing to 33 million gallons in 2022. Future minimum volume purchase requirements from 2023 through 2024 total 50 million gallons. The aggregate dollar amount of the future minimum volume purchase requirements is dependent on the future weighted average wholesale cost per gallon charged under the applicable supply agreements. The amounts and timing of the related payment obligations cannot reasonably be estimated reliably. As a result, payment of these amounts has been excluded from the table above. See Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Amended Omnibus Agreement contingently requires us to perform environmental remediation work as further discussed in Note 14 to the financial statements. We also have operating leases and motor fuel purchase commitments as previously discussed in Contractual Obligations\u201d and in Notes 13 and 15 to the financial statements.\nOther Matters Impacting Liquidity and Capital Resources\nConcentration of Customers\nIn 2017, we distributed approximately 13% of our total wholesale distribution volumes to DMS and its affiliates and DMS and its affiliates accounted for approximately 22% of our rental income. In 2017, we distributed 8% of our total wholesale distribution volume to Circle K retail sites that are not supplied by CST Fuel Supply and received 20% of our rental income from Circle K. For more information regarding transactions with DMS and its affiliates and CST or Circle K, see Note 12 to the financial statements for additional information.\nCommon Unit Offering\nOn June 19, 2015, we closed on the sale to the public of 4.6 million common units for net proceeds of approximately $138.5 million. On July 16, 2015, we closed on the sale of an additional 0.2 million common units for net proceeds of approximately $6.4 million in accordance with the underwriters' option to purchase additional common units. See Note 17 to the financial statements for additional information.\nPartnership Common Unit Purchases by CST\nOn September 21, 2015, CST approved a common unit purchase program under Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, authorizing CST to purchase up to an aggregate of $50 million of the common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership. The unit purchase program does not have a fixed expiration date and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time at CST's discretion. CST made no purchases under the common unit purchase program during 2016 or 2017. From inception until December 31, 2015, CST had purchased $19.8 million, or 804,667 common units, at an average price of $24.64 per common unit, which common units cannot be transferred absent registration with the SEC or an available exemption from the SEC's registration requirements.\nCommon Unit Repurchase Program\nIn November 2015, the Board approved a common unit repurchase program under Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act authorizing us to repurchase up to an aggregate of $25 million of the common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership. Under the program, we may make purchases in the open market in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, or in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to a trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act or otherwise. Any purchases will be funded from available cash on hand. The common unit repurchase program does not require us to acquire any specific number of common units and may be suspended or terminated by us at any time without prior notice. The purchases will not be made from any officer, director or control person of the Partnership or CST. We did not repurchase any common units under the plan in 2017. The following table shows the purchases made through December 31, 2016:\nTable 258: <table> <tr> <td> Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\nNumber of\nUnits\nPurchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average\nPrice Paid\nper Unit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total Cost\nof Units\nPurchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\nRemaining\nunder\nthe Program\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 154,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23.37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,603,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,396,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 133,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,252,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,144,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 287,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23.84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,855,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,144,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPurchase of CST Fuel Supply Equity Interests\nIn January 2015 and again in July 2015, we closed on the purchase of a 5% and 12.5%, respectively, limited partner equity interest in CST Fuel Supply for aggregate consideration of 4.8 million common units and cash in the amount of $17.5 million. See Note 12 to the financial statements for additional information.\nAcquisition of Landmark Assets\nIn January 2015, in connection with the joint acquisition by CST and CrossAmerica of 22 retail sites from Landmark Assets, we acquired the real property of the 22 fee sites for $41.2 million. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information.\nAcquisition of Erickson\nIn February 2015, we closed on the purchase of all of the outstanding capital stock of Erickson and certain related assets for an aggregate purchase price of $83.8 million, including working capital and net of cash acquired. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information.\nPurchase of NTI retail sites\nIn July 2015, we completed the purchase of real property at 29 NTIs from CST in exchange for an aggregate consideration of approximately 0.3 million common units and cash in the amount of $124.4 million, with an aggregate consideration of $134.0 million on the date of closing. See Note 12 to the financial statements for additional information.\nAcquisition of One Stop\nIn July 2015, we closed on the purchase of retail sites from One Stop and certain related assets for $45.0 million, including working capital and net of cash acquired. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information.\nPurchase of Wholesale Fuel Supply Contracts from CST\nIn February 2016, CST sold 21 independent dealer contracts and 11 sub-wholesaler contracts to us for $2.9 million. See Notes 3 and 12 to the financial statements for additional information.\nAcquisition of Franchised Holiday Stores\nOn March 29, 2016, we closed on the acquisition of 31 Franchise Holiday Stores and three company operated liquor stores from S/S/G Corporation for approximately $52.4 million, including working capital. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information.\nAcquisition of State Oil Assets\nOn September 27, 2016, we acquired certain assets of State Oil Company located in the greater Chicago market for approximately $41.9 million, including working capital. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information.\nAcquisition of Jet-Pep Assets\nOn November 28, 2017, we acquired certain assets of Jet-Pep, Inc. and affiliated companies located in Alabama for approximately $75.6 million, including working capital. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information.\nContingencies\nEnvironmental Matters\nSee Note 14 to the financial statements for a discussion of our environmental matters.\nLegal Matters\nSee Note 15 to the financial statements for a discussion of our legal matters.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nSee Note 23 to the financial statements for financial and operating quarterly data for each quarter of 2017 and 2016.\nOutlook\nAs noted previously, the prices paid to our motor fuel suppliers for wholesale motor fuel (which affects our costs of sales) are highly correlated to the price of crude oil. The crude oil commodity markets are highly volatile, and the market prices of crude oil, and, correspondingly, the market prices of wholesale motor fuel, experience significant and rapid fluctuations, which affect our motor fuel gross profit. See Significant Factors Affecting our Profitability-The Significance of Crude Oil and Wholesale Motor Fuel Prices on Our Revenues, Cost of Sales and Gross Profit\u201d for additional information.\nWe expect our rent income to increase in 2018 based on our recent acquisitions and our expectation that we will continue to convert company operated retail sites to lessee dealers.\nWe will continue to evaluate acquisitions on an opportunistic basis. Additionally, we will pursue acquisition targets that fit into our strategy. Whether we will be able to execute acquisitions will depend on market conditions, availability of suitable acquisition targets at attractive terms, acquisition related compliance with customary regulatory requirements, and our ability to finance such acquisitions on favorable terms and in compliance with our debt covenant restrictions.\nNew Accounting Policies\nFor information on recent accounting pronouncements impacting our business, see Note 2 to the financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies Involving Critical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies.\nCritical accounting policies are those we believe are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because we must make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. We believe the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenues from wholesale motor fuel sales when motor fuel is delivered to the customer. The purchase and delivery of motor fuels generally occurs on the same day. We recognize revenues from retail sales when motor fuel is sold to the customer. We record inventory from the time of the purchase of motor fuels from third party suppliers until the retail sale to the end customer.\nWe recognize revenue from leasing arrangements ratably over the term of the underlying lease. Renewals are not assumed unless reasonably assured.\nRevenues from retail food and merchandise sales are recognized net of applicable provisions for discounts and allowances upon delivery, generally at the point of sale.\nAccounts receivable primarily result from the sale of motor fuels to customers and rental fees for retail sites. The majority of our accounts receivable relate to motor fuel sales that can generally be described as high volume and low margin activities. Credit is extended to a customer based on an evaluation of the customer's financial condition. In certain circumstances collateral may be required from the customer. Receivables are recorded at face value, without interest or discount.\nThe provision for bad debts is generally based upon a specific analysis of aged accounts while also factoring in any new business conditions that might impact the historical analysis, such as market conditions and bankruptcies of particular customers. Bad debt provisions are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nWe review all accounts receivable balances on at least a quarterly basis and provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and on a specific identification basis.\nLGW collects motor fuel taxes, which consist of various pass through taxes collected from customers on behalf of taxing authorities, and remits such taxes directly to those taxing authorities. LGW's accounting policy is to exclude the tax collected and remitted from wholesale revenues and cost of sales and account for them as liabilities. LGWS's retail sales and cost of sales include motor fuel taxes as the taxes are included in the cost paid for motor fuel and LGWS has no direct responsibility to collect or remit such taxes to the taxing authorities.\nAsset Acquisitions and Business Combinations\nWe early adopted ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business, effective January 1, 2017. Under this guidance, we first determine whether substantially all of the fair value of the set of gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets. If this threshold is met, the set is not a business. If this threshold is not met, we determine whether the set meets the definition of a business.\nA business is defined as an integrated set of assets and activities that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors or other owners, members or participants. A business typically has inputs, processes applied to those inputs and outputs that are used to generate a return to investors, but outputs are not required for a set to be a business. A business must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs.\nWe account for asset acquisitions (i.e. transactions involving the acquisition of a set of assets that does not meet the definition of a business) in accordance with the guidance under ASC 805-50 and other applicable guidance. Asset acquisitions are generally accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis. Two of the key differences in accounting for transactions as asset acquisitions as compared to business combination are summarized below:\nTable 259: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Transaction costs are capitalized as a component of the cost of the assets acquired rather than expensed as incurred;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 260: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Goodwill is not recognized. Rather, any excess consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is allocated on a relative fair value basis to the identifiable net assets other than certain non-qualifying assets as defined in the guidance.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe account for business combinations in accordance with the guidance under ASC 805-Business Combinations. The purchase price is recorded for assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair value. The excess of the fair value of the consideration conveyed over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nThe income statement includes the results of operations for each acquisition from their respective date of acquisition.\nWhether we account for a transaction as an asset acquisition or a business combination, determining the fair value of these items requires management's judgment, the utilization of independent valuation experts and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, market prices and asset lives, among other items. The judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the investee, as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability, can materially impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition, such as through depreciation and amortization. For more information on our acquisitions, see Note 3 to the financial statements.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually, and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the goodwill might be impaired. The annual impairment testing date of goodwill is October 1.\nWe early adopted ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, effective January 1, 2017.\nIn performing our annual impairment analysis, ASC 350-20, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, allows us to use qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (likelihood of more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill.\nIf, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further testing is necessary. However, if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we perform the goodwill impairment test.\nIn the goodwill impairment test, the reporting unit's carrying amount (including goodwill) and its fair value are compared. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge is recognized for the deficit up to the amount of goodwill recorded.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had $89.1 million of goodwill recorded in our segments. After assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units exceed their carrying amounts and therefore goodwill is not impaired at December 31, 2017.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWhen we install or acquire USTs, we recognize the estimated future cost to remove our USTs over their estimated useful lives. We record a discounted liability for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation with a corresponding increase to the carrying value of the related long-lived asset at the time a UST is installed. We depreciate the amount added to property and equipment and recognize accretion expense in connection with the discounted liability over the remaining life of the UST.\nWe base our estimates of such future costs on our prior experience with removal and include normal and customary costs we expect to incur associated with UST removal. We compare our cost estimates with our actual removal cost experience on an annual basis, and when the actual costs we experience exceed our original estimates, we will recognize an additional liability for estimated future costs to remove the USTs. Because these estimates are subjective and are currently based on historical costs with adjustments for estimated future changes in the associated costs, the dollar amount of these obligations could change as more information is obtained.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, our liabilities related to the removal of USTs recorded in the consolidated financial statements were $31.5 million and $27.8 million, respectively. A 10% change in our estimate of anticipated future costs for removal of USTs as of December 31, 2017 would change our asset retirement obligation by approximately $3.1 million. See also Note 10 under the caption Asset Retirement Obligations\u201d to the financial statements.\nEnvironmental Liabilities\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, our environmental reserves recorded in the consolidated financial statements were $3.5 million and $4.2 million, respectively. These environmental reserves represent our estimates for future expenditures for remediation and related litigation associated with contaminated retail sites as a result of releases (e.g. overfills, spills and releases) and are based on current regulations, historical results and certain other factors.\nEnvironmental liabilities that we have recorded are based on internal and external estimates of costs to remediate retail sites. Factors considered in the estimates of the liability are the expected cost and the estimated length of time to remediate each contaminated site. Estimated remediation costs are not discounted because the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. Reimbursements under state trust fund programs are recognized when received because such amounts are insignificant. The adequacy of the liability is evaluated quarterly and adjustments are made based on updated experience at existing retail sites, newly identified retail sites and changes in governmental policy. A 10% change in our estimate of future costs related to environmental liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2017 would change our environmental liabilities and operating expenses by $0.4 million. See Note 14 to the financial statements for additional information.\nTax Matters\nAs a limited partnership, we are not subject to federal and state income taxes. Income tax attributable to our taxable income, which may differ significantly from income for financial statement purposes, is assessed at the individual level of the unit holder. We are subject to a statutory requirement that non-qualifying income, as defined by the Internal Revenue Code, cannot exceed 10% of total gross income for the calendar year. If non-qualifying income exceeds this statutory limit, we would be taxed as a corporation. The non-qualifying income did not exceed the statutory limit in any period.\nCertain activities that generate non-qualifying income are conducted through our wholly owned taxable corporate subsidiary, LGWS. Current and deferred income taxes are recognized on the earnings of LGWS. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates.\nValuation allowances are initially recorded and reevaluated each reporting period by assessing the likelihood of the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset. We consider a number of factors in assessing the realization of a deferred tax asset, including the reversal of temporary differences, projections of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The amount of deferred tax assets ultimately realized may differ materially from the estimates utilized in the computation of valuation allowances and may materially impact the financial statements in the future.\nAs a result of a reassessment of the positive and negative evidence supporting whether or not a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is needed, we released the entire $3.7 million valuation allowance in 2017. See Note 19 to the financial statements for additional information.", "item_7_truncated": "In 2017, we distributed approximately 13% of our total wholesale distribution volumes to DMS and its affiliates and DMS and its affiliates accounted for approximately 22% of our rental income. In 2017, we distributed 8% of our total wholesale distribution volume to Circle K retail sites that are not supplied by CST Fuel Supply and received 20% of our rental income from Circle K. For more information regarding transactions with DMS and its affiliates and CST or Circle K, see Note 12 to the financial statements for additional information.\nTable 257: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

a result of the conversion of company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites in 2015 and 2016, partially offset by the incremental gross profit generated by the Franchised Holiday Stores acquisition. The decline in our merchandise gross profit percentage was the result of low gross margin items, such as cigarettes, comprising a higher percentage of our merchandise sales as a result of the change

We categorize our capital requirements as either sustaining capital expenditures, growth capital expenditures or acquisition capital expenditures. Sustaining capital expenditures are those capital expenditures required to maintain our long-term operating income or operating capacity. Acquisition and growth capital expenditures are those capital expenditures that we expect will increase our operating income or operating capacity over the long term. We have the ability to fund our capital expenditures by additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility or, if available to us on acceptable terms, issuing additional equity, debt securities or other options, such as the sale of assets. With the significant decline in energy prices since 2014, access to the capital markets has tightened for the energy and MLP industries as a whole, which has impacted our cost of capital and our ability to raise equity and debt financing at favorable terms. Our ability to access the capital markets may have an impact on our ability to fund acquisitions. We may not be able to complete any offering of securities or other options on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nWe early adopted ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, effective January 1, 2017.\nIncome tax benefit\n \u2022 Our merchandise and services gross profit decreased $4.6 million or 15% as a result of the conversion of company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites, partially offset by the incremental gross profit generated by the March 2016 Franchised Holiday Stores acquisition. \n \u2022 Critical Accounting Policies Involving Critical Accounting Estimates-This section describes the accounting policies and estimates that we consider most important for our business and that require significant judgment. \nWhether we account for a transaction as an asset acquisition or a business combination, determining the fair value of these items requires management's judgment, the utilization of independent valuation experts and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, market prices and asset lives, among other items. The judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the investee, as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability, can materially impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition, such as through depreciation and amortization. For more information on our acquisitions, see Note 3 to the financial statements.\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion expense\nAsset Retirement Obligations\n \u2022 CST's Merger-This section provides information on the Merger. \nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio are used as supplemental financial measures by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors and lenders. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used to assess our financial performance without regard to financing methods, capital structure or income taxes and the ability to incur and service debt and to fund capital expenditures. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is used to assess the operating performance of our business on a consistent basis by excluding the impact of items which do not result directly from the wholesale distribution of motor fuel, the leasing of real property, or the day to day operations of our retail site activities. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio are also used to assess the ability to generate cash sufficient to make distributions to our unitholders.\nOur intersegment revenues increased $39.2 million or 16%, primarily attributable to the increase in wholesale motor fuel prices discussed above.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $3.7 million primarily attributable to a $7.1 million charge recorded upon closing of the Merger for certain severance and benefit costs for certain terminated officers and other employees of CST Services who provided services to the Partnership and retention bonuses to certain EICP participants and a $1.7 million charge related to a court ruling in favor of a former executive's claim to benefits under the EICP change in control provisions, partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease driven by the integration of prior year acquisitions and other cost savings initiatives and a $3.5 million decrease in management fees charged by Circle K and equity compensation expense as a result of personnel and salary reductions effective at the time of the Merger.\n \u2022 In July 2015, we completed the purchase of real property at 29 NTIs from CST in exchange for an aggregate consideration of approximately 0.3 million common units and cash in the amount of $124.4 million, with an aggregate consideration of $134.0 million on the date of closing. \nIntersegment revenues\nIn performing our annual impairment analysis, ASC 350-20, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, allows us to use qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (likelihood of more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill.\nGross profit\n\nContingencies\nSee Note 15 to the financial statements for a discussion of our legal matters.\n \u2022 On July 7, 2016, CST provided an $18.2 million refund payment to us related to our interest in CST Fuel Supply. \nFor information on recent accounting pronouncements impacting our business, see Note 2 to the financial statements.\nIn 2017, we paid $75.6 million in the Jet-Pep Assets acquisition and incurred $12.5 million in capital expenditures. In addition, we received $27.6 million of proceeds on sales, largely driven by the sale of 29 properties to DMR and two properties sold as a result of the FTC's requirements associated with the Merger.\nEnvironmental liabilities that we have recorded are based on internal and external estimates of costs to remediate retail sites. Factors considered in the estimates of the liability are the expected cost and the estimated length of time to remediate each contaminated site. Estimated remediation costs are not discounted because the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. Reimbursements under state trust fund programs are recognized when received because such amounts are insignificant. The adequacy of the liability is evaluated quarterly and adjustments are made based on updated experience at existing retail sites, newly identified retail sites and changes in governmental policy. A 10% change in our estimate of future costs related to environmental liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2017 would change our environmental liabilities and operating expenses by $0.4 million. See Note 14 to the financial statements for additional information.\n \u2022 Our motor fuel gross profit decreased $10.9 million attributable to a 24% decrease in volume driven by the conversion of company operated retail sites acquired in prior acquisitions to lessee dealer sites during 2015 and 2016 and a 42% decrease in margin per gallon as a result of crude oil prices being more volatile during the second half of 2015 than the second half of 2016 and the resulting impact on our motor fuel gross margin. The daily spot price of WTI crude oil decreased approximately 35% during the last six months of 2015 compared to an increase of approximately 10% during the same period of 2016. See Significant Factors Affecting our Profitability-The Significance of Crude Oil and Wholesale Motor Fuel Prices on Our Revenues, Cost of Sales and Gross Profit.\u201d \n\nOn September 27, 2016, we acquired certain assets of State Oil Company located in the greater Chicago market for approximately $41.9 million, including working capital. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information.\nWe will continue to evaluate acquisitions on an opportunistic basis. Additionally, we will pursue acquisition targets that fit into our strategy. Whether we will be able to execute acquisitions will depend on market conditions, availability of suitable acquisition targets at attractive terms, acquisition related compliance with customary regulatory requirements, and our ability to finance such acquisitions on favorable terms and in compliance with our debt covenant restrictions.\nCost of sales\nOther Liabilities\nWe early adopted ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business, effective January 1, 2017. Under this guidance, we first determine whether substantially all of the fair value of the set of gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets. If this threshold is met, the set is not a business. If this threshold is not met, we determine whether the set meets the definition of a business.\n (e) The distribution coverage ratio is computed by dividing Distributable Cash Flow by the weighted average diluted common and subordinated units and then dividing that result by the distributions paid per limited partner unit. \nConsolidated Results\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $9.5 million for 2017 compared to 2016, driven primarily by incremental cash flow generated by our March 2016 Franchised Holiday Stores, September 2016 State Oil Assets and November 2017 Jet-Pep Assets acquisitions. In addition, we paid $1.1 million more of the management fees related to the services provided under the Amended Omnibus Agreement in common units issued to CST (pre-Merger) and Circle K (post-Merger) in 2017 compared to 2016.\n (c) In addition, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, we distributed motor fuel to 15 and 14 sub-wholesalers who distributed to additional sites. \nNew Accounting Policies\nGross profit\n\nIn January 2015 and again in July 2015, we closed on the purchase of a 5% and 12.5%, respectively, limited partner equity interest in CST Fuel Supply for aggregate consideration of 4.8 million common units and cash in the amount of $17.5 million. See Note 12 to the financial statements for additional information.\nRent and other gross profit increased $5.5 million primarily as a result of our September 2016 acquisition of the State Oil Assets, as well as converting company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites throughout 2016 and 2017, partially offset by 25 DMS sites being converted to commission agent sites in the fourth quarter of 2016, which resulted in the rent income from these 25 sites being included in the retail segment rather than the wholesale segment.\nThese results were impacted by:\n\nInterest Payments on Debt\n (e) The increase in the lessee dealer site count from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to the conversion of DMS and commission sites to lessee dealer sites. \nOn June 19, 2015, we closed on the sale to the public of 4.6 million common units for net proceeds of approximately $138.5 million. On July 16, 2015, we closed on the sale of an additional 0.2 million common units for net proceeds of approximately $6.4 million in accordance with the underwriters' option to purchase additional common units. See Note 17 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\nConsolidated Results\n \u2022 Results of Operations-This section provides an analysis of our results of operations, including the results of operations of our business segments, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 and non-GAAP financial measures. \n\nThe results were driven by:\nOur principal executive offices are in Allentown, Pennsylvania, in an office space leased by Circle K, for which the rent is charged to us as a cost under the Amended Omnibus Agreement. Future lease payments on this office lease are included within operating lease obligations.\nIn accordance with the terms of the Partnership Agreement, on February 25, 2016, the first business day after the payment of the fourth quarter 2015 distribution of $0.5925 per unit, the subordination period under the Partnership Agreement ended. At that time, each of the 7,525,000 outstanding subordinated units converted into one common unit and now participates in distributions pro rata with other common units.\nGoodwill\nConsolidated Income Statement Analysis\n \u2022 On September 27, 2016, we acquired the State Oil Assets located in the greater Chicago market for approximately $41.9 million, including working capital. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nWe believe the presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio provides useful information to investors in assessing the financial condition and results of operations. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio should not be considered alternatives to net income or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income. Additionally, because EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\nRent and other gross profit\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, our liabilities related to the removal of USTs recorded in the consolidated financial statements were $31.5 million and $27.8 million, respectively. A 10% change in our estimate of anticipated future costs for removal of USTs as of December 31, 2017 would change our asset retirement obligation by approximately $3.1 million. See also Note 10 under the caption Asset Retirement Obligations\u201d to the financial statements.\nOn September 21, 2015, CST approved a common unit purchase program under Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, authorizing CST to purchase up to an aggregate of $50 million of the common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership. The unit purchase program does not have a fixed expiration date and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time at CST's discretion. CST made no purchases under the common unit purchase program during 2016 or 2017. From inception until December 31, 2015, CST had purchased $19.8 million, or 804,667 common units, at an average price of $24.64 per common unit, which common units cannot be transferred absent registration with the SEC or an available exemption from the SEC's registration requirements.\nTax Matters\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion expense increased $6.2 million primarily driven by our 2015 and 2016 acquisitions.\n \u2022 A $268 million, or 14%, decline in our Wholesale segment revenues primarily attributable to: \nOperating revenues\nIncome from CST Fuel Supply equity interests\n (d) The decrease in the independent dealer site count from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to a net 19 terminated motor fuel supply contracts that were not renewed. \n \u2022 Goodwill is not recognized. Rather, any excess consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is allocated on a relative fair value basis to the identifiable net assets other than certain non-qualifying assets as defined in the guidance. \nOperating expenses decreased $0.1 million primarily from a $5.2 million cost savings associated with disposing of certain transportation and terminal assets acquired in the PMI acquisition, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses driven by our acquisitions.\nThe $4.5 million decrease in motor fuel gross profit was due to a $3.6 million decline primarily from decreased payment discounts and incentives due to the decline in motor fuel prices as a result of the decrease in crude oil and the remaining decline was primarily due to a decline in motor fuel gallons sold due to the termination of commercial wholesale fuel supply contracts and disposing certain terminal assets acquired in the PMI acquisition, partially offset by the impact of the Erickson, One Stop, Franchised Holiday Stores and State Oil Assets acquisitions. The average daily spot price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil decreased 11% to $43.29 per barrel during 2016, compared to $48.66 during 2015. See Significant Factors Affecting our Profitability-The Significance of Crude Oil and Wholesale Motor Fuel Prices on Our Revenues, Cost of Sales and Gross Profit.\u201d\n \u2022 On December 21, 2016, we sold the real property at 17 fee sites acquired in the State Oil Assets acquisition for $25.0 million in proceeds, which were used to repay borrowings under the credit facility. We subsequently leased these sites back under a triple net lease agreement. \n \u2022 Our rent and other gross profit increased $0.9 million primarily from 25 DMS sites being converted to commission agent sites in the fourth quarter of 2016, which resulted in the rent income from these sites being included in the retail segment rather than the wholesale segment. In the second quarter of 2017, some of these 25 sites were converted to lessee dealer sites, which resulted in the rent income being included in the wholesale segment rather than the retail segment. \n (g) The increase in the commission agent site count from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the 101 sites acquired in the Jet-Pep Assets acquisition, partially offset by the conversion of commission sites to lessee dealer sites. \nAcquisition and Financing Activity\nPurchase of CST Fuel Supply Equity Interests\nSee Results of Operations-Segment Results-Wholesale\u201d for discussion.\nWe distributed $4.3 million and $3.4 million to CST and Circle K with respect to the IDRs in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n (d) The decrease in company operated retail sites relates to the conversion of company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites. \nOn November 28, 2017, we closed on the acquisition of the real property and the fuel supply business of 101 commission operated retail sites, including 92 fee simple sites, the leasehold interest in five real property sites and the fuel supply business to four independent commission sites, all located in Alabama, from Jet-Pep, Inc. and affiliated entities, for an aggregate cash consideration of $75.6 million, including working capital. On the same day, Circle K closed on the acquisition of certain related retail and terminal assets from Jet-Pep, Inc. and affiliated entities.\nImpact of Inflation\nCapital Expenditures\nWe use non-GAAP financial measures EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio. EBITDA represents net income available to us before deducting interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA as further adjusted to exclude equity funded expenses related to incentive compensation and the Amended Omnibus Agreement, gains or losses on sales of assets, certain discrete acquisition related costs, such as legal and other professional fees and severance expenses associated with recently acquired companies, and certain other discrete non-cash items arising from purchase accounting. Distributable Cash Flow represents Adjusted EBITDA less cash interest expense, sustaining capital expenditures and current income tax expense. Distribution Coverage Ratio is computed by dividing Distributable Cash Flow by the weighted average diluted common and subordinated units and then dividing that result by the distributions paid per limited partner unit.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nOn November 28, 2017, we acquired certain assets of Jet-Pep, Inc. and affiliated companies located in Alabama for approximately $75.6 million, including working capital. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information.\nEnvironmental Liabilities\n \u2022 On September 27, 2017, as approved by the independent conflicts committee of our Board, we sold 29 properties to DMR for $18.9 million. These sites were generally sites at which we did not supply fuel or represented vacant land. \nAs noted previously, the prices paid to our motor fuel suppliers for wholesale motor fuel (which affects our costs of sales) are highly correlated to the price of crude oil. The crude oil commodity markets are highly volatile, and the market prices of crude oil, and, correspondingly, the market prices of wholesale motor fuel, experience significant and rapid fluctuations, which affect our motor fuel gross profit. See Significant Factors Affecting our Profitability-The Significance of Crude Oil and Wholesale Motor Fuel Prices on Our Revenues, Cost of Sales and Gross Profit\u201d for additional information.\n \u2022 On November 28, 2017, we acquired the Jet-Pep Assets located in Alabama for approximately $75.6 million, including working capital. \n (c) The increase in the commission agent site count from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 was due primarily to the 101 sites acquired in the Jet-Pep Assets acquisition, partially offset by the conversion of commission sites to lessee dealer sites. \nWe present the results of operations of our segments on a consistent basis with how our management views the business. Therefore, our segments are presented before intersegment eliminations (which consist of motor fuel sold by our Wholesale segment to our Retail segment). As a result, in order to reconcile to our consolidated change in operating revenues, a discussion of the change in intersegment revenues is included in our consolidated MD&A discussion.\nIn February 2016, CST sold 21 independent dealer contracts and 11 sub-wholesaler contracts to us for $2.9 million. See Notes 3 and 12 to the financial statements for additional information.\nThe provision for bad debts is generally based upon a specific analysis of aged accounts while also factoring in any new business conditions that might impact the historical analysis, such as market conditions and bankruptcies of particular customers. Bad debt provisions are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nOur revolving credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets. Our borrowings under the revolving credit facility had a weighted-average interest rate of 4.44% as of December 31, 2017 (LIBOR plus an applicable margin, which was 3.00% as of December 31, 2017). Letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2017 totaled $6.7 million. The amount of availability under the revolving credit facility at February 21, 2018, after taking into consideration debt covenant restrictions, was $17.6 million. In connection with future acquisitions, the revolving credit facility requires, among other things, that we have, after giving effect to such acquisition, at least $20 million in the aggregate of borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and unrestricted cash on the balance sheet on the date of such acquisition. We are required to maintain a total leverage ratio (as defined in the revolving credit facility) for the most recently completed four fiscal quarters of less than or equal to 4.50 : 1.00, except for the quarter in which a material acquisition occurs and the first three full fiscal quarters following a material acquisition, generally defined as an acquisition with a purchase price of at least $30.0 million, with a ratio of 5.00 : 1.00, and a consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the revolving credit facility) of greater than or equal to 2.75 : 1.00. The computation of our total leverage ratio allows for a pro forma application of the EBITDA (as defined in the revolving credit facility) of acquired entities and was 4.14 : 1.00 as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with these financial covenant ratios.\n \u2022 A $254 million decline (95% of the total decline in Wholesale Segment operating revenues) attributable to a decrease in the wholesale price of our motor fuel. The average daily spot price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil decreased 11% to $43.29 per barrel during 2016, compared to $48.66 per barrel during 2015. The wholesale price of motor fuel is highly correlated to the price of crude oil. \nThe income statement includes the results of operations for each acquisition from their respective date of acquisition.\n \u2022 The $3.1 million decline in operating expenses was attributable to the conversion of company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites, partially offset by the impact of the March 2016 Franchised Holiday Stores acquisition and the 25 DMS sites being converted to commission agent sites in the fourth quarter of 2016. In the second quarter of 2017, some of these 25 sites were converted to lessee dealer sites, which resulted in the operating expenses being included in the wholesale segment rather than the retail segment. \nThe prices paid to our motor fuel suppliers for wholesale motor fuel (which affects our cost of sales) are highly correlated to the price of crude oil. The crude oil commodity markets are highly volatile, and the market prices of crude oil, and, correspondingly, the market prices of wholesale motor fuel, experience significant and rapid fluctuations. We receive a fixed mark-up per gallon on approximately 85% of gallons sold to our customers. The remaining gallons are primarily DTW priced contracts with our customers. These contracts provide for variable, market based pricing that results in motor fuel gross profit effects similar to retail motor fuel gross profits (as crude oil prices decline, motor fuel gross profit generally increases, as discussed in our Retail segment below). The increase in DTW gross profit results from the acquisition cost of wholesale motor fuel declining at a faster rate as compared to the rate retail motor fuel prices decline. Conversely, our DTW motor fuel gross profit declines when the cost of wholesale motor fuel increases at a faster rate as compared to the rate retail motor fuel prices increase.\nAcquisition of One Stop\nIncome from our investment in CST Fuel Supply increased $5.5 million as a result of the additional 12.5% equity interest we acquired in July 2015, partially offset by CST's sale of its California and Wyoming retail sites.\nRevenues from retail food and merchandise sales are recognized net of applicable provisions for discounts and allowances upon delivery, generally at the point of sale.\nCertain activities that generate non-qualifying income are conducted through our wholly owned taxable corporate subsidiary, LGWS. Current and deferred income taxes are recognized on the earnings of LGWS. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates.\nConcentration of Customers\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nWe account for business combinations in accordance with the guidance under ASC 805-Business Combinations. The purchase price is recorded for assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair value. The excess of the fair value of the consideration conveyed over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nRenegotiation of Rocky Top Purchase Obligation\nOur intersegment revenues decreased $116.9 million, primarily attributable to the declines in price and volume discussed above.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\n \u2022 Our motor fuel gross profit decreased $1.3 million attributable to a 15% decrease in margin per gallon as a result of the movement in crude oil prices throughout the two periods. See Significant Factors Affecting our Profitability-The Significance of Crude Oil and Wholesale Motor Fuel Prices on Our Revenues, Cost of Sales and Gross Profit.\u201d \nA business is defined as an integrated set of assets and activities that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors or other owners, members or participants. A business typically has inputs, processes applied to those inputs and outputs that are used to generate a return to investors, but outputs are not required for a set to be a business. A business must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs.\nSee Results of Operations-Segment Results\u201d for additional operating expenses analyses.\nIn July 2015, we completed the purchase of real property at 29 NTIs from CST in exchange for an aggregate consideration of approximately 0.3 million common units and cash in the amount of $124.4 million, with an aggregate consideration of $134.0 million on the date of closing. See Note 12 to the financial statements for additional information.\nWe expect our rent income to increase in 2018 based on our recent acquisitions and our expectation that we will continue to convert company operated retail sites to lessee dealers.\n \u2022 On September 6, 2017, we sold two properties to an unaffiliated third party as a result of the FTC's requirements associated with the Merger for $6.7 million. \nIn November 2015, the Board approved a common unit repurchase program under Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act authorizing us to repurchase up to an aggregate of $25 million of the common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership. Under the program, we may make purchases in the open market in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, or in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to a trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act or otherwise. Any purchases will be funded from available cash on hand. The common unit repurchase program does not require us to acquire any specific number of common units and may be suspended or terminated by us at any time without prior notice. The purchases will not be made from any officer, director or control person of the Partnership or CST. We did not repurchase any common units under the plan in 2017. The following table shows the purchases made through December 31, 2016:\nInterest expense increased $4.3 million due to additional borrowings during 2015 and 2016 to fund acquisitions.\nRetail\nThe payments in the table above represent payments on sale-leaseback transactions for which the sale was not recognized as a result of the continuing involvement with the sites. As such, the table above includes the payments under the lease.\nWholesale segment\nValuation allowances are initially recorded and reevaluated each reporting period by assessing the likelihood of the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset. We consider a number of factors in assessing the realization of a deferred tax asset, including the reversal of temporary differences, projections of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The amount of deferred tax assets ultimately realized may differ materially from the estimates utilized in the computation of valuation allowances and may materially impact the financial statements in the future.\nInterest expense\nAsset Acquisitions and Business Combinations\nWe typically experience lower retail motor fuel gross profits in periods when the wholesale cost of motor fuel increases, and higher retail motor fuel gross profits in periods when the wholesale cost of motor fuel declines.\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of $18.2 million and $0.5 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The benefit in 2017 was primarily due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which resulted in a net benefit of $13.2 million. In addition, as a result of a reassessment of the positive and negative evidence supporting whether or not a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is needed, we released the entire $3.7 million valuation allowance in 2017. See Note 19 for additional information.\nRegarding our supplier relationships, a majority of our total gallons purchased are subject to Terms Discounts. The dollar value of these discounts increases and decreases corresponding to motor fuel prices. Therefore, in periods of lower wholesale motor fuel prices, our gross profit is negatively affected and, in periods of higher wholesale motor fuel prices, our gross profit is positively affected (as it relates to these discounts).\nIn connection with the Rocky Top acquisition that we completed in September 2013, we entered into a deferred seller financing arrangement, which obligated us to purchase certain sites over a 5-year period for an average $5.2 million per year beginning in 2016 at an approximately 7.7% capitalization rate. In June 2016, we renegotiated the terms with the sellers, eliminating the deferred seller financing obligation and agreeing to terms of a new lease of the assets for an initial term of 15 years and eight months with four renewal options of five years each. Under this triple net lease, annual rent is initially $1.8 million based on a 6.5% capitalization rate and increases 1.5% per year. However, because of the continuing involvement we have with the sites through the lease and sublease of the properties, we recorded the liability on our balance sheet at fair value in June 2016, which approximated its carrying value. This sale-leaseback liability is classified within accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on the balance sheet.\nIn 2016, we paid $94.2 million in the Franchised Holiday Stores and State Oil Assets acquisitions and $2.9 million for independent dealer and sub-wholesaler contracts purchased from CST. We also incurred $20.8 million of capital expenditures and received $17.5 million in proceeds from the refund payment related to CST's sale of the California and Wyoming assets.\n\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion expense\nCommon Unit Repurchase Program\nOther Matters Impacting Liquidity and Capital Resources\nDuring 2017, the Partnership recognized a $5.4 million charge for certain severance and benefit costs associated with certain officers and other employees of CST Services who provided services to the Partnership and who terminated employment upon the consummation of the Merger, which constituted a change in control, as defined in the EICP and CST's severance plans. Such costs are included in general and administrative expenses and were primarily paid by Circle K in the third quarter of 2017. Accounts payable to related parties includes these costs as we will reimburse Circle K.\nManagement Fees\nThe following table highlights the results of operations and certain operating metrics of our Retail segment. The narrative following these tables provides an analysis of the results of operations of that segment (thousands of dollars, except for the number of retail sites and per gallon amounts):\n (a) Represents income from our equity interest in CST Fuel Supply. \n \u2022 A decrease of $124 million from a 24% decrease in motor fuel volumes sold related to the conversion of company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites during 2015 and 2016, partially offset by the incremental volume generated by the Franchised Holiday Stores acquisition. \nIn December 2016, we sold the real property at 17 sites acquired through the State Oil Assets asset acquisition for cash proceeds of $25.0 million, which were used to repay borrowings on the credit facility. We leased these properties for an initial term of 15 years with three renewal options of approximately five years each. Under the triple net lease, annual rent is initially $1.6 million based on a 6.5% capitalization rate and increases every five years based on inflation. Because of the continuing involvement we have with the sites through the lease and sublease of the properties, we recorded a liability for the proceeds received and are amortizing this liability over the lease term as rent payments are made. This sale-leaseback liability is classified within accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on the balance sheet.\nLegal Matters\nOn June 28, 2017, a wholly owned subsidiary of Circle K merged with and into CST, with CST surviving the Merger as an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Circle K. Circle K is a wholly owned subsidiary of Couche-Tard.\nIn the goodwill impairment test, the reporting unit's carrying amount (including goodwill) and its fair value are compared. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge is recognized for the deficit up to the amount of goodwill recorded.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\n \u2022 A $240 million, or 15%, increase in our Wholesale segment revenues primarily attributable to the increase in crude oil prices. The average daily spot price of WTI crude oil increased 17% to $50.78 per barrel in 2017, compared to $43.29 per barrel in 2016. The wholesale price of motor fuel is highly correlated to the price of crude oil. See Significant Factors Affecting our Profitability-The Significance of Crude Oil and Wholesale Motor Fuel Prices on Our Revenues, Cost of Sales and Gross Profit.\u201d \nSee Note 14 to the financial statements for a discussion of our environmental matters.\nSale Leaseback Obligations\nSeasonality Effects on Volumes\nIn 2015, we paid $167.8 million in the Landmark Assets, Erickson and One Stop acquisitions and $141.9 million on the acquisitions of CST's NTIs and CST Fuel Supply equity interests. We also had $10.2 million in capital expenditures.\nThe following MD&A is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. This section is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with Items 1., 1A. and 8. (which includes our consolidated financial statements) contained in this report.\nAs a limited partnership, we are not subject to federal and state income taxes. Income tax attributable to our taxable income, which may differ significantly from income for financial statement purposes, is assessed at the individual level of the unit holder. We are subject to a statutory requirement that non-qualifying income, as defined by the Internal Revenue Code, cannot exceed 10% of total gross income for the calendar year. If non-qualifying income exceeds this statutory limit, we would be taxed as a corporation. The non-qualifying income did not exceed the statutory limit in any period.\nInterest expense increased $5.2 million due to an increase in the average interest rate charged on our credit facility borrowings from 3.5% to 4.2% and additional borrowings to fund our recent acquisitions. In addition, we incurred $1.6 million of interest expense in 2017 related to our sale leaseback executed in December 2016.\nWe have certain retail site properties under capital leases. Capital lease obligations in the table above include both principal and interest.\nEnvironmental Matters\nThe following table presents reconciliations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Distributable Cash Flow to net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, for each of the periods indicated (in thousands, except for per unit amounts):\nSee Results of Operations-Segment Results\u201d for additional operating expenses analyses.\nCost of sales\nInterest expense\nRetail segment\nAcquisition of Jet-Pep Assets\nPartnership Common Unit Purchases by CST\nRent and other margin increased $13 million primarily as a result of our acquisition from CST of NTI retail sites in July 2015 and the State Oil Assets acquisition in September 2016, as well as converting company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites.\nThe Amended Omnibus Agreement contingently requires us to perform environmental remediation work as further discussed in Note 14 to the financial statements. We also have operating leases and motor fuel purchase commitments as previously discussed in Contractual Obligations\u201d and in Notes 13 and 15 to the financial statements.\nOperating expenses\nWe account for asset acquisitions (i.e. transactions involving the acquisition of a set of assets that does not meet the definition of a business) in accordance with the guidance under ASC 805-50 and other applicable guidance. Asset acquisitions are generally accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis. Two of the key differences in accounting for transactions as asset acquisitions as compared to business combination are summarized below:\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies.\nInflation affects our financial performance by increasing certain of our operating expenses and cost of goods sold. Operating expenses include labor costs, leases, and general and administrative expenses. While our Wholesale segment benefits from higher Terms Discounts as a result of higher fuel costs, inflation could negatively impact our Retail segment as a result of higher motor fuel, merchandise and operating costs. Although we have historically been able to pass on increased costs through price increases, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future.\n \u2022 Partially offsetting this decline was a $15 million increase primarily related to rental income associated with the acquisition from CST of NTI retail sites in July 2015 and the State Oil Assets acquisition as well as converting company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites. \nMotor fuel gross profit\n \u2022 New Accounting Policies-This section describes new accounting pronouncements that we have already adopted, those that we are required to adopt in the future and those that became applicable in the current year as a result of new circumstances. \nBelow is an analysis of our consolidated statements of income and provides the primary reasons for significant increases and decreases in the various income statement line items from period to period. Our consolidated statements of income are as follows (in thousands):\nThe amount of any distribution is subject to the discretion of the Board, which may modify or revoke our cash distribution policy at any time. Our Partnership Agreement does not require us to pay any distributions. As such, there can be no assurance we will continue to pay distributions in the future.\nSignificant Factors Affecting our Profitability\nRevenue Recognition\n (b) Relates to certain discrete acquisition related costs, such as legal and other professional fees, separation benefit costs and purchase accounting adjustments associated with recently acquired businesses. Acquisition-related costs for 2017 include certain separation benefit costs and retention bonuses paid to certain EICP participants associated with the Merger. Acquisition-related costs for 2017 also includes a $1.7 million charge related to a court ruling in favor of a former executive's claim to benefits under the EICP in connection with CST's acquisition of our General Partner. See Significant Factors Affecting our Profitability-Separation Benefits and Retention Bonuses\u201d for additional information. \nOperating revenues increased $225 million, or 12%, while gross profit increased $5.2 million, or 3.3%.\nThe following table reconciles our segment Adjusted EBITDA to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA presented in the table above (in thousands):\nOperating expenses\nGain on sales of assets, net\n (b) Please see the reconciliation of our segment's Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated net income under the heading Results of Operations-Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below. \nCritical accounting policies are those we believe are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because we must make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. We believe the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements.\nOperating revenues\nAt December 31, 2017, we had $89.1 million of goodwill recorded in our segments. After assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units exceed their carrying amounts and therefore goodwill is not impaired at December 31, 2017.\n\nExpiration of the Subordination Period\nThe results were driven by:\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, our environmental reserves recorded in the consolidated financial statements were $3.5 million and $4.2 million, respectively. These environmental reserves represent our estimates for future expenditures for remediation and related litigation associated with contaminated retail sites as a result of releases (e.g. overfills, spills and releases) and are based on current regulations, historical results and certain other factors.\nIntersegment revenues\nOperating expenses\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nFinancing Activities\nAccounts receivable primarily result from the sale of motor fuels to customers and rental fees for retail sites. The majority of our accounts receivable relate to motor fuel sales that can generally be described as high volume and low margin activities. Credit is extended to a customer based on an evaluation of the customer's financial condition. In certain circumstances collateral may be required from the customer. Receivables are recorded at face value, without interest or discount.\nWe recognize revenues from wholesale motor fuel sales when motor fuel is delivered to the customer. The purchase and delivery of motor fuels generally occurs on the same day. We recognize revenues from retail sales when motor fuel is sold to the customer. We record inventory from the time of the purchase of motor fuels from third party suppliers until the retail sale to the end customer.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $15.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015, driven primarily by incremental cash flow generated by our acquisitions. In addition, we settled $3.2 million more in management fees in equity with CST in 2016 compared to 2015.\nWhen we install or acquire USTs, we recognize the estimated future cost to remove our USTs over their estimated useful lives. We record a discounted liability for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation with a corresponding increase to the carrying value of the related long-lived asset at the time a UST is installed. We depreciate the amount added to property and equipment and recognize accretion expense in connection with the discounted liability over the remaining life of the UST.\nOutlook\nSignificant items impacting these results prior to the elimination of intercompany revenues were:\nIncome from CST Fuel Supply equity interests\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nCouche-Tard and CST Merger\n\nUnder the terms of various supply agreements, the Partnership is obligated to minimum volume purchases measured in gallons of motor fuel. Future minimum volume purchase requirements are 347 million gallons in 2018, reducing to 33 million gallons in 2022. Future minimum volume purchase requirements from 2023 through 2024 total 50 million gallons. The aggregate dollar amount of the future minimum volume purchase requirements is dependent on the future weighted average wholesale cost per gallon charged under the applicable supply agreements. The amounts and timing of the related payment obligations cannot reasonably be estimated reliably. As a result, payment of these amounts has been excluded from the table above. See Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information.\nIn January 2015, in connection with the joint acquisition by CST and CrossAmerica of 22 retail sites from Landmark Assets, we acquired the real property of the 22 fee sites for $41.2 million. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information.\nAcquisition of Franchised Holiday Stores\nOn July 7, 2016, in connection with the divestiture of certain California and Wyoming assets and the related decrease in supplied fuel volumes and as approved by the independent conflicts committee of the Board, CST provided a refund payment to the purchase price paid by us for our interest in CST Fuel Supply. The total refund payment received by us was approximately $18.2 million. See Note 12 to the financial statements for additional information.\nOperating expenses\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \u2022 In February 2015, we closed on the purchase of all of the outstanding capital stock of Erickson and certain related assets for an aggregate purchase price of $83.8 million, including working capital. \nOur business is subject to seasonality due to our wholesale and retail sites being located in certain geographic areas that are affected by seasonal weather and temperature trends and associated changes in retail customer activity during different seasons. Historically, sales volumes have been highest in the second and third quarters (during the summer months) and lowest during the winter months in the first and fourth quarters.\n \u2022 In July 2015, we closed on the purchase of retail sites from One Stop and certain related assets for $45.0 million, including working capital. \n (b) Please see the reconciliation of our segment's Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated net income (loss) under the heading Results of Operations-Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d \n \u2022 Significant Factors Affecting Our Profitability-This section describes the significant impact on our results of operations caused by crude oil commodity price volatility, seasonality and acquisition and financing activities. \nThe operating lease obligations include leases for land, office facilities and retail sites. Operating lease obligations reflected in the table above include all operating leases that have initial or remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases. In addition, such amounts do not reflect contingent rentals that may be incurred in addition to minimum rentals.\nDistribution activity for 2017 was as follows:\nThe following table summarizes cash flow activity (in thousands):\n (a) As approved by the independent conflicts committee of the Board, the Partnership, CST and Circle K mutually agreed to settle certain amounts due under the terms of the Amended Omnibus Agreement in limited partner units of the Partnership. \nAs a result of a reassessment of the positive and negative evidence supporting whether or not a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is needed, we released the entire $3.7 million valuation allowance in 2017. See Note 19 to the financial statements for additional information.\n \u2022 A decline of $45 million primarily attributable to a decrease in the retail price of our motor fuel driven by a decline in wholesale motor fuel prices as noted above. \n \u2022 Transaction costs are capitalized as a component of the cost of the assets acquired rather than expensed as incurred; \nOperating expenses increased $3.4 million primarily as a result of our September 2016 State Oil Assets acquisition, which is substantially offset by an increase in rent income, as well as our conversion of company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites throughout 2016 and 2017.\nRent and other gross profit\nDebt\nWholesale\n \u2022 On December 13, 2016, we amended our credit facility to provide additional flexibility to support achieving our growth strategy. \nIn 2016, we paid $83.6 million in distributions and purchased $3.3 million in common units under our common unit purchase program. We received $25.0 million in proceeds on the sale-leaseback transaction and had $83.1 million in net borrowings under our credit facility to fund our acquisitions.\nDistributions\nOther liabilities include asset retirement obligations described in Note 10 to the financial statements and exclude other liabilities whose payment period or amount is not determinable. For purposes of reflecting amounts for asset retirement obligations in the table above, we have made our best estimate of expected payments based on information available as of December 31, 2017.\n (d) On January 24, 2018, the Board approved a quarterly distribution of $0.6275 per unit attributable to the fourth quarter of 2017. The distribution is payable on February 12, 2018 to all unitholders of record on February 5, 2018. \nMD&A is organized as follows:\nContractual Obligations\nWe were a co-defendant, together with our General Partner, CST and CST Services LLC, in a lawsuit brought by a former executive of CST Services who, until March 2015, provided services to us as Chief Investment Officer and Vice President of Finance (Court of Common Pleas, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, case number 2015-1003). In connection with CST's acquisition of our General Partner in 2014, the plaintiff alleged breach of contract and associated claims relating to his termination of employment and claimed severance benefits under the EICP. In October 2017, a jury awarded the plaintiff a total of $1.7 million. Under the EICP, we were also obligated to pay reasonable legal expenses incurred by the plaintiff in connection with this dispute.\n (a) The inventory fair value adjustment represents the expensing of the step-up in value ascribed to inventory acquired in the Franchised Holiday Stores acquisition. \nSee Note 23 to the financial statements for financial and operating quarterly data for each quarter of 2017 and 2016.\nPurchase of NTI retail sites\nThe payments in the table above represent contractually obligated payments under the Amended Omnibus Agreement. See Note 12 to the financial statements for additional information.\n (f) The decrease in the DMS site count from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to the conversion of DMS sites to lessee dealer sites. \nCommon Unit Offering\nOperating Activities\nThese results were impacted by:\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion expense increased $3.1 million primarily driven by our recent acquisitions.\nPurchase of Wholesale Fuel Supply Contracts from CST\nResults of Operations\nOur results of operations and financial condition are also impacted by our acquisition and financing activities as summarized below.\nInvesting Activities\nMotor fuel gross profit\nCash Flows\nWe present the results of operations of our segments consistently with how our management views the business. Therefore, our segments are presented before intersegment eliminations (which consist of motor fuel sold by our Wholesale segment to our Retail segment). As a result, in order to reconcile to our consolidated change in operating revenues, a discussion of the change in intersegment revenues is included in our consolidated MD&A discussion.\nWe attempt to pass along wholesale motor fuel price changes to our retail customers through at the pump\u201d retail price changes; however, market conditions do not always allow us to do so immediately. The timing of any related increase or decrease in at the pump\u201d retail prices is affected by competitive conditions in each geographic market in which we operate. As such, the prices we charge our customers for motor fuel and the gross profit we receive on our motor fuel sales can increase or decrease significantly over short periods of time.\nAs a result of the Merger, Circle K indirectly owns all of the membership interests in the sole member of our General Partner, as well as a 21.1% limited partner interest in the Partnership and all of the outstanding IDRs of the Partnership. Circle K, through its indirect ownership interest in the sole member of our General Partner, has the ability to appoint all of the members of the Board and to control and manage the operations and activities of the Partnership.\nThe $4.7 million or 9% increase in motor fuel gross profit was primarily due to a higher margin per gallon realized primarily due to higher DTW margins as a result of the movements in crude prices throughout both periods and increased payment discounts and incentives due to the increase in motor fuel prices. The average daily spot price of WTI crude oil increased 17% to $50.78 per barrel for 2017, compared to $43.29 per barrel for 2016. See Significant Factors Affecting our Profitability-The Significance of Crude Oil and Wholesale Motor Fuel Prices on Our Revenues, Cost of Sales and Gross Profit.\u201d\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\n \u2022 An $11.0 million decline in operating expenses attributable to the conversion of company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites, partially offset by the impact of the Erickson, One Stop and Franchised Holiday Stores acquisitions. \nIf, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further testing is necessary. However, if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we perform the goodwill impairment test.\nSeparation Benefits and Retention Bonuses\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nChanges in our average motor fuel selling price per gallon and gross margin are directly related to the changes in crude oil and wholesale motor fuel prices. Variations in our reported revenues and cost of sales are, therefore, primarily related to the price of crude oil and wholesale motor fuel prices and generally not as a result of changes in motor fuel sales volumes, unless otherwise indicated and discussed below.\nIn July 2015, we closed on the purchase of retail sites from One Stop and certain related assets for $45.0 million, including working capital and net of cash acquired. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information.\nIn February 2015, we closed on the purchase of all of the outstanding capital stock of Erickson and certain related assets for an aggregate purchase price of $83.8 million, including working capital and net of cash acquired. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information.\nGross profit declined $22.5 million, while operating expenses declined $11.0 million.\nAcquisition of Erickson\nCost of sales increased $220 million or 13% as a result of the increase in wholesale motor fuel prices. See Results of Operations-Segment Results\u201d for additional gross profit analyses.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe believe that we will have sufficient cash flow from operations, borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility and access to capital markets and alternate sources of funding to meet our financial commitments, debt service obligations, contingencies, anticipated capital expenditures and partnership distributions. However, we are subject to business and operational risks that could adversely affect our cash flow. A material decrease in our cash flows would likely produce an adverse effect on our borrowing capacity as well as our ability to issue additional equity and/or debt securities.\nOperating revenues declined $356 million, or 16%, while gross profit declined $13.9 million, or 8%.\nOperating Lease Obligations\n \u2022 On February 5, 2016, we purchased independent dealer and sub-wholesaler contracts from CST for $2.9 million. \nWe review all accounts receivable balances on at least a quarterly basis and provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and on a specific identification basis.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our consolidated debt and capital lease obligations consisted of the following (in thousands):\nOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 are summarized below (in thousands):\nOperating expenses\nSuch amounts include estimates of interest expense related to our credit facility assuming a 4.5% interest rate.\nWe recognize revenue from leasing arrangements ratably over the term of the underlying lease. Renewals are not assumed unless reasonably assured.\n \u2022 A $29.5 million decrease as a result of the divestiture of low margin wholesale fuel supply contracts and other assets acquired in the PMI acquisition, partially offset by the impact of the Erickson, One Stop, Franchised Holiday Stores and State Oil Assets acquisitions. \nOperating expenses\nDuring 2017, we recorded a $2.2 million gain on the sale of two properties as required by the FTC in connection with the Merger and a $0.8 million gain on the sale of 29 properties to DMR. We also recorded a $0.8 million gain related to the renewal of a contract by DMS with one of its customers, which triggered an earn out payment to be paid by DMS to us in connection with a contract entered into with DMS at the time of CST's acquisition of our General Partner in October 2014.\n \u2022 In January 2015, we closed on the purchase of a 5% limited partner equity interest in CST Fuel Supply for approximately 1.5 million common units with an aggregate consideration of $60.0 million on the date of closing. \nOn March 29, 2016, we closed on the acquisition of 31 Franchise Holiday Stores and three company operated liquor stores from S/S/G Corporation for approximately $52.4 million, including working capital. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information.\n \u2022 On March 29, 2016, we closed on the acquisition of Franchised Holiday Stores and company operated liquor stores from S/S/G Corporation for approximately $52.4 million, including working capital. \nIn 2017, we paid $88.2 million in distributions and made net borrowings on our credit facility of $64.5 million.\nSignificant items impacting these results prior to the elimination of intercompany revenues were:\nIDRs\nThe decline of $1.1 million was primarily attributable to CST's July 2016 divestiture of its California and Wyoming retail sites and a decrease in volume driven by the impacts of Hurricane Harvey.\nRefund payment related to CST sale of California and Wyoming assets\nLGW collects motor fuel taxes, which consist of various pass through taxes collected from customers on behalf of taxing authorities, and remits such taxes directly to those taxing authorities. LGW's accounting policy is to exclude the tax collected and remitted from wholesale revenues and cost of sales and account for them as liabilities. LGWS's retail sales and cost of sales include motor fuel taxes as the taxes are included in the cost paid for motor fuel and LGWS has no direct responsibility to collect or remit such taxes to the taxing authorities.\nAcquisition of Landmark Assets\nThe following table highlights the results of operations and certain operating metrics of our Wholesale segment. The narrative following these tables provides an analysis of the results of operations of that segment (thousands of dollars, except for the number of distribution sites and per gallon amounts):\nLiquidity\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually, and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the goodwill might be impaired. The annual impairment testing date of goodwill is October 1.\nIn 2015, we received $144.9 million in net proceeds on equity offerings and $158.0 million in net borrowings under our credit facility to fund our acquisitions. We paid $66.1 million in distributions and purchased $3.6 million in common units under our common unit purchase program.\nAcquisition of State Oil Assets\n \u2022 A $37 million decline in our merchandise revenues attributable to the conversion of company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites during 2015 and 2016, partially offset by the incremental merchandise revenues generated by the Franchised Holiday Stores acquisition. \nSegment Results\nWe present the results of operations of our segments consistent with how our management views the business. Therefore, our segments are presented before intersegment eliminations (which consist of motor fuel sold by our Wholesale segment to our Retail segment). These comparisons are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nSale Leaseback Transaction\nGross profit declined $5.0 million, while operating expenses declined $3.1 million.", "item_7_text": "In 2017, we distributed approximately 13% of our total wholesale distribution volumes to DMS and its affiliates and DMS and its affiliates accounted for approximately 22% of our rental income. In 2017, we distributed 8% of our total wholesale distribution volume to Circle K retail sites that are not supplied by CST Fuel Supply and received 20% of our rental income from Circle K. For more information regarding transactions with DMS and its affiliates and CST or Circle K, see Note 12 to the financial statements for additional information.\nCritical Accounting Policies Involving Critical Accounting Estimates\n \u2022 In January 2015, in connection with the joint acquisition by CST and the Partnership of 22 retail sites from Landmark Assets, we acquired the real property of the 22 fee sites for $41.2 million. \n \u2022 Our merchandise and services gross profit declined $11.6 million as a result of the conversion of company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites in 2015 and 2016, partially offset by the incremental gross profit generated by the Franchised Holiday Stores acquisition. The decline in our merchandise gross profit percentage was the result of low gross margin items, such as cigarettes, comprising a higher percentage of our merchandise sales as a result of the change in product mix of our stores following our 2015 acquisitions and conversion of company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites. \nThe Significance of Crude Oil and Wholesale Motor Fuel Prices on Our Revenues, Cost of Sales and Gross Profit\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations and other capital requirements, including capital expenditures, acquisitions, and partnership distributions, will depend on our future operating performance, which, in turn, will be subject to general economic, financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other conditions, many of which are beyond our control. As a normal part of our business, depending on market conditions, we will, from time to time, consider opportunities to repay, redeem, repurchase or refinance our indebtedness. Changes in our operating plans, lower than anticipated sales, increased expenses, acquisitions or other events may cause us to seek additional debt or equity financing in future periods.\n \u2022 A $24 million, or 5%, increase in our Retail segment revenues primarily attributable to the increase in crude oil prices, largely offset by conversion of company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites. See Significant Factors Affecting our Profitability-The Significance of Crude Oil and Wholesale Motor Fuel Prices on Our Revenues, Cost of Sales and Gross Profit.\u201d \n \u2022 Liquidity and Capital Resources-This section provides a discussion of our financial condition and cash flows. It also includes a discussion of our debt, capital requirements, other matters impacting our liquidity and capital resources and an outlook for our business. \nWe recorded income tax benefits of $0.5 million and $3.5 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in the income tax benefit was primarily due to a decrease in the loss generated by our corporate subsidiaries. In addition, we recorded a reduction in the valuation allowance of $0.2 million during 2015.\n \u2022 In July 2015, we closed on the purchase of a 12.5% limited partner equity interest in CST Fuel Supply for approximately 3.3 million common units and cash in the amount of $17.5 million, with an aggregate consideration of approximately $110.9 million on the date of closing. \nWe base our estimates of such future costs on our prior experience with removal and include normal and customary costs we expect to incur associated with UST removal. We compare our cost estimates with our actual removal cost experience on an annual basis, and when the actual costs we experience exceed our original estimates, we will recognize an additional liability for estimated future costs to remove the USTs. Because these estimates are subjective and are currently based on historical costs with adjustments for estimated future changes in the associated costs, the dollar amount of these obligations could change as more information is obtained.\nOur principal liquidity requirements are to finance our operations, fund acquisitions, service our debt and pay distributions to our unitholders and IDR distributions. We expect our ongoing sources of liquidity to include cash generated by our operations and borrowings under the revolving credit facility and, if available to us on acceptable terms, issuances of equity and debt securities. We regularly evaluate alternate sources of capital, including sale-leaseback financing of real property with third parties, to support our liquidity requirements.\nCrossAmerica purchases motor fuel for our Jet-Pep Assets from Circle K at Circle K's cost plus terminal and administration fees of $0.015 per gallon. Circle K's cost to supply these sites includes price fluctuations associated with index-based motor fuel pricing for pipeline delivery and the generation and sale of RINs. Circle K has implemented a motor fuel price hedging program to mitigate the price risk during delivery; however, we are exposed to more price risk with these motor fuel purchases from Circle K as compared to our other motor fuel purchases.\nThe following table outlines our capital expenditures and acquisitions for 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nGeneral and administrative expenses declined $12.1 million primarily attributable to the integration of prior year acquisitions and other cost savings initiatives, which reduced expenses by approximately $9.9 million. Additionally, equity-based compensation expense decreased $1.2 million as a result of less equity awards being granted in 2016 as compared to 2015.\n (c) Under the Partnership Agreement, sustaining capital expenditures are capital expenditures made to maintain our long-term operating income or operating capacity. Examples of sustaining capital expenditures are those made to maintain existing contract volumes, including payments to renew existing distribution contracts, or to maintain our sites in conditions suitable to lease, such as parking lot or roof replacement/renovation, or to replace equipment required to operate the existing business. \nAcquisition of Jet-Pep Assets\nIn addition, certain participants in the EICP received retention bonuses that will be paid in annual installments that began in July 2017 and will continue through July 2019. The Partnership recorded a $1.0 million charge during 2017 in connection with the payments made by Circle K in July 2017, which were included in general and administrative expenses. In addition, the Partnership recognized a $0.7 million charge in 2017 for the payments expected to be made in July 2018 and July 2019. The Partnership anticipates recognizing future charges totaling $0.9 million over the remaining retention period, of which $0.8 million is anticipated to be recognized in 2018.\n\nCost of sales declined $343 million as a result of the decline in the wholesale price and gallons sold of motor fuel as noted above. See Results of Operations-Segment Results\u201d for additional gross profit analyses.\nIncome from CST Fuel Supply equity interests\n \u2022 In June 2015, we closed on the sale of 4.6 million common units for net proceeds of approximately $138.5 million. In July 2015, we closed on the sale of an additional 0.2 million common units for net proceeds of approximately $6.4 million in accordance with the underwriters' option to purchase additional common units associated with the June offering. We used the proceeds to reduce indebtedness outstanding under our credit facility. \n \u2022 A $205 million, or 31%, decline in our Retail segment revenues primarily attributable to: \nIncome tax benefit\nCapital Lease Obligations\nWe make investments to expand, upgrade and enhance existing assets. We categorize our capital requirements as either sustaining capital expenditures, growth capital expenditures or acquisition capital expenditures. Sustaining capital expenditures are those capital expenditures required to maintain our long-term operating income or operating capacity. Acquisition and growth capital expenditures are those capital expenditures that we expect will increase our operating income or operating capacity over the long term. We have the ability to fund our capital expenditures by additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility or, if available to us on acceptable terms, issuing additional equity, debt securities or other options, such as the sale of assets. With the significant decline in energy prices since 2014, access to the capital markets has tightened for the energy and MLP industries as a whole, which has impacted our cost of capital and our ability to raise equity and debt financing at favorable terms. Our ability to access the capital markets may have an impact on our ability to fund acquisitions. We may not be able to complete any offering of securities or other options on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nWe early adopted ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, effective January 1, 2017.\nIncome tax benefit\n \u2022 Our merchandise and services gross profit decreased $4.6 million or 15% as a result of the conversion of company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites, partially offset by the incremental gross profit generated by the March 2016 Franchised Holiday Stores acquisition. \n \u2022 Critical Accounting Policies Involving Critical Accounting Estimates-This section describes the accounting policies and estimates that we consider most important for our business and that require significant judgment. \nWhether we account for a transaction as an asset acquisition or a business combination, determining the fair value of these items requires management's judgment, the utilization of independent valuation experts and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, market prices and asset lives, among other items. The judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the investee, as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability, can materially impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition, such as through depreciation and amortization. For more information on our acquisitions, see Note 3 to the financial statements.\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion expense\nAsset Retirement Obligations\n \u2022 CST's Merger-This section provides information on the Merger. \nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio are used as supplemental financial measures by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors and lenders. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used to assess our financial performance without regard to financing methods, capital structure or income taxes and the ability to incur and service debt and to fund capital expenditures. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is used to assess the operating performance of our business on a consistent basis by excluding the impact of items which do not result directly from the wholesale distribution of motor fuel, the leasing of real property, or the day to day operations of our retail site activities. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio are also used to assess the ability to generate cash sufficient to make distributions to our unitholders.\nOur intersegment revenues increased $39.2 million or 16%, primarily attributable to the increase in wholesale motor fuel prices discussed above.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $3.7 million primarily attributable to a $7.1 million charge recorded upon closing of the Merger for certain severance and benefit costs for certain terminated officers and other employees of CST Services who provided services to the Partnership and retention bonuses to certain EICP participants and a $1.7 million charge related to a court ruling in favor of a former executive's claim to benefits under the EICP change in control provisions, partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease driven by the integration of prior year acquisitions and other cost savings initiatives and a $3.5 million decrease in management fees charged by Circle K and equity compensation expense as a result of personnel and salary reductions effective at the time of the Merger.\n \u2022 In July 2015, we completed the purchase of real property at 29 NTIs from CST in exchange for an aggregate consideration of approximately 0.3 million common units and cash in the amount of $124.4 million, with an aggregate consideration of $134.0 million on the date of closing. \nIntersegment revenues\nIn performing our annual impairment analysis, ASC 350-20, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, allows us to use qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (likelihood of more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill.\nGross profit\n\nContingencies\nSee Note 15 to the financial statements for a discussion of our legal matters.\n \u2022 On July 7, 2016, CST provided an $18.2 million refund payment to us related to our interest in CST Fuel Supply. \nFor information on recent accounting pronouncements impacting our business, see Note 2 to the financial statements.\nIn 2017, we paid $75.6 million in the Jet-Pep Assets acquisition and incurred $12.5 million in capital expenditures. In addition, we received $27.6 million of proceeds on sales, largely driven by the sale of 29 properties to DMR and two properties sold as a result of the FTC's requirements associated with the Merger.\nEnvironmental liabilities that we have recorded are based on internal and external estimates of costs to remediate retail sites. Factors considered in the estimates of the liability are the expected cost and the estimated length of time to remediate each contaminated site. Estimated remediation costs are not discounted because the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. Reimbursements under state trust fund programs are recognized when received because such amounts are insignificant. The adequacy of the liability is evaluated quarterly and adjustments are made based on updated experience at existing retail sites, newly identified retail sites and changes in governmental policy. A 10% change in our estimate of future costs related to environmental liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2017 would change our environmental liabilities and operating expenses by $0.4 million. See Note 14 to the financial statements for additional information.\n \u2022 Our motor fuel gross profit decreased $10.9 million attributable to a 24% decrease in volume driven by the conversion of company operated retail sites acquired in prior acquisitions to lessee dealer sites during 2015 and 2016 and a 42% decrease in margin per gallon as a result of crude oil prices being more volatile during the second half of 2015 than the second half of 2016 and the resulting impact on our motor fuel gross margin. The daily spot price of WTI crude oil decreased approximately 35% during the last six months of 2015 compared to an increase of approximately 10% during the same period of 2016. See Significant Factors Affecting our Profitability-The Significance of Crude Oil and Wholesale Motor Fuel Prices on Our Revenues, Cost of Sales and Gross Profit.\u201d \n\nOn September 27, 2016, we acquired certain assets of State Oil Company located in the greater Chicago market for approximately $41.9 million, including working capital. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information.\nWe will continue to evaluate acquisitions on an opportunistic basis. Additionally, we will pursue acquisition targets that fit into our strategy. Whether we will be able to execute acquisitions will depend on market conditions, availability of suitable acquisition targets at attractive terms, acquisition related compliance with customary regulatory requirements, and our ability to finance such acquisitions on favorable terms and in compliance with our debt covenant restrictions.\nCost of sales\nOther Liabilities\nWe early adopted ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business, effective January 1, 2017. Under this guidance, we first determine whether substantially all of the fair value of the set of gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets. If this threshold is met, the set is not a business. If this threshold is not met, we determine whether the set meets the definition of a business.\n (e) The distribution coverage ratio is computed by dividing Distributable Cash Flow by the weighted average diluted common and subordinated units and then dividing that result by the distributions paid per limited partner unit. \nConsolidated Results\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $9.5 million for 2017 compared to 2016, driven primarily by incremental cash flow generated by our March 2016 Franchised Holiday Stores, September 2016 State Oil Assets and November 2017 Jet-Pep Assets acquisitions. In addition, we paid $1.1 million more of the management fees related to the services provided under the Amended Omnibus Agreement in common units issued to CST (pre-Merger) and Circle K (post-Merger) in 2017 compared to 2016.\n (c) In addition, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, we distributed motor fuel to 15 and 14 sub-wholesalers who distributed to additional sites. \nNew Accounting Policies\nGross profit\n\nIn January 2015 and again in July 2015, we closed on the purchase of a 5% and 12.5%, respectively, limited partner equity interest in CST Fuel Supply for aggregate consideration of 4.8 million common units and cash in the amount of $17.5 million. See Note 12 to the financial statements for additional information.\nRent and other gross profit increased $5.5 million primarily as a result of our September 2016 acquisition of the State Oil Assets, as well as converting company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites throughout 2016 and 2017, partially offset by 25 DMS sites being converted to commission agent sites in the fourth quarter of 2016, which resulted in the rent income from these 25 sites being included in the retail segment rather than the wholesale segment.\nThese results were impacted by:\n\nInterest Payments on Debt\n (e) The increase in the lessee dealer site count from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to the conversion of DMS and commission sites to lessee dealer sites. \nOn June 19, 2015, we closed on the sale to the public of 4.6 million common units for net proceeds of approximately $138.5 million. On July 16, 2015, we closed on the sale of an additional 0.2 million common units for net proceeds of approximately $6.4 million in accordance with the underwriters' option to purchase additional common units. See Note 17 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\nConsolidated Results\n \u2022 Results of Operations-This section provides an analysis of our results of operations, including the results of operations of our business segments, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 and non-GAAP financial measures. \n\nThe results were driven by:\nOur principal executive offices are in Allentown, Pennsylvania, in an office space leased by Circle K, for which the rent is charged to us as a cost under the Amended Omnibus Agreement. Future lease payments on this office lease are included within operating lease obligations.\nIn accordance with the terms of the Partnership Agreement, on February 25, 2016, the first business day after the payment of the fourth quarter 2015 distribution of $0.5925 per unit, the subordination period under the Partnership Agreement ended. At that time, each of the 7,525,000 outstanding subordinated units converted into one common unit and now participates in distributions pro rata with other common units.\nGoodwill\nConsolidated Income Statement Analysis\n \u2022 On September 27, 2016, we acquired the State Oil Assets located in the greater Chicago market for approximately $41.9 million, including working capital. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nWe believe the presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio provides useful information to investors in assessing the financial condition and results of operations. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio should not be considered alternatives to net income or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income. Additionally, because EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\nRent and other gross profit\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, our liabilities related to the removal of USTs recorded in the consolidated financial statements were $31.5 million and $27.8 million, respectively. A 10% change in our estimate of anticipated future costs for removal of USTs as of December 31, 2017 would change our asset retirement obligation by approximately $3.1 million. See also Note 10 under the caption Asset Retirement Obligations\u201d to the financial statements.\nOn September 21, 2015, CST approved a common unit purchase program under Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, authorizing CST to purchase up to an aggregate of $50 million of the common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership. The unit purchase program does not have a fixed expiration date and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time at CST's discretion. CST made no purchases under the common unit purchase program during 2016 or 2017. From inception until December 31, 2015, CST had purchased $19.8 million, or 804,667 common units, at an average price of $24.64 per common unit, which common units cannot be transferred absent registration with the SEC or an available exemption from the SEC's registration requirements.\nTax Matters\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion expense increased $6.2 million primarily driven by our 2015 and 2016 acquisitions.\n \u2022 A $268 million, or 14%, decline in our Wholesale segment revenues primarily attributable to: \nOperating revenues\nIncome from CST Fuel Supply equity interests\n (d) The decrease in the independent dealer site count from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to a net 19 terminated motor fuel supply contracts that were not renewed. \n \u2022 Goodwill is not recognized. Rather, any excess consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is allocated on a relative fair value basis to the identifiable net assets other than certain non-qualifying assets as defined in the guidance. \nOperating expenses decreased $0.1 million primarily from a $5.2 million cost savings associated with disposing of certain transportation and terminal assets acquired in the PMI acquisition, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses driven by our acquisitions.\nThe $4.5 million decrease in motor fuel gross profit was due to a $3.6 million decline primarily from decreased payment discounts and incentives due to the decline in motor fuel prices as a result of the decrease in crude oil and the remaining decline was primarily due to a decline in motor fuel gallons sold due to the termination of commercial wholesale fuel supply contracts and disposing certain terminal assets acquired in the PMI acquisition, partially offset by the impact of the Erickson, One Stop, Franchised Holiday Stores and State Oil Assets acquisitions. The average daily spot price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil decreased 11% to $43.29 per barrel during 2016, compared to $48.66 during 2015. See Significant Factors Affecting our Profitability-The Significance of Crude Oil and Wholesale Motor Fuel Prices on Our Revenues, Cost of Sales and Gross Profit.\u201d\n \u2022 On December 21, 2016, we sold the real property at 17 fee sites acquired in the State Oil Assets acquisition for $25.0 million in proceeds, which were used to repay borrowings under the credit facility. We subsequently leased these sites back under a triple net lease agreement. \n \u2022 Our rent and other gross profit increased $0.9 million primarily from 25 DMS sites being converted to commission agent sites in the fourth quarter of 2016, which resulted in the rent income from these sites being included in the retail segment rather than the wholesale segment. In the second quarter of 2017, some of these 25 sites were converted to lessee dealer sites, which resulted in the rent income being included in the wholesale segment rather than the retail segment. \n (g) The increase in the commission agent site count from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the 101 sites acquired in the Jet-Pep Assets acquisition, partially offset by the conversion of commission sites to lessee dealer sites. \nAcquisition and Financing Activity\nPurchase of CST Fuel Supply Equity Interests\nSee Results of Operations-Segment Results-Wholesale\u201d for discussion.\nWe distributed $4.3 million and $3.4 million to CST and Circle K with respect to the IDRs in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n (d) The decrease in company operated retail sites relates to the conversion of company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites. \nOn November 28, 2017, we closed on the acquisition of the real property and the fuel supply business of 101 commission operated retail sites, including 92 fee simple sites, the leasehold interest in five real property sites and the fuel supply business to four independent commission sites, all located in Alabama, from Jet-Pep, Inc. and affiliated entities, for an aggregate cash consideration of $75.6 million, including working capital. On the same day, Circle K closed on the acquisition of certain related retail and terminal assets from Jet-Pep, Inc. and affiliated entities.\nImpact of Inflation\nCapital Expenditures\nWe use non-GAAP financial measures EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio. EBITDA represents net income available to us before deducting interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA as further adjusted to exclude equity funded expenses related to incentive compensation and the Amended Omnibus Agreement, gains or losses on sales of assets, certain discrete acquisition related costs, such as legal and other professional fees and severance expenses associated with recently acquired companies, and certain other discrete non-cash items arising from purchase accounting. Distributable Cash Flow represents Adjusted EBITDA less cash interest expense, sustaining capital expenditures and current income tax expense. Distribution Coverage Ratio is computed by dividing Distributable Cash Flow by the weighted average diluted common and subordinated units and then dividing that result by the distributions paid per limited partner unit.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nOn November 28, 2017, we acquired certain assets of Jet-Pep, Inc. and affiliated companies located in Alabama for approximately $75.6 million, including working capital. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information.\nEnvironmental Liabilities\n \u2022 On September 27, 2017, as approved by the independent conflicts committee of our Board, we sold 29 properties to DMR for $18.9 million. These sites were generally sites at which we did not supply fuel or represented vacant land. \nAs noted previously, the prices paid to our motor fuel suppliers for wholesale motor fuel (which affects our costs of sales) are highly correlated to the price of crude oil. The crude oil commodity markets are highly volatile, and the market prices of crude oil, and, correspondingly, the market prices of wholesale motor fuel, experience significant and rapid fluctuations, which affect our motor fuel gross profit. See Significant Factors Affecting our Profitability-The Significance of Crude Oil and Wholesale Motor Fuel Prices on Our Revenues, Cost of Sales and Gross Profit\u201d for additional information.\n \u2022 On November 28, 2017, we acquired the Jet-Pep Assets located in Alabama for approximately $75.6 million, including working capital. \n (c) The increase in the commission agent site count from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 was due primarily to the 101 sites acquired in the Jet-Pep Assets acquisition, partially offset by the conversion of commission sites to lessee dealer sites. \nWe present the results of operations of our segments on a consistent basis with how our management views the business. Therefore, our segments are presented before intersegment eliminations (which consist of motor fuel sold by our Wholesale segment to our Retail segment). As a result, in order to reconcile to our consolidated change in operating revenues, a discussion of the change in intersegment revenues is included in our consolidated MD&A discussion.\nIn February 2016, CST sold 21 independent dealer contracts and 11 sub-wholesaler contracts to us for $2.9 million. See Notes 3 and 12 to the financial statements for additional information.\nThe provision for bad debts is generally based upon a specific analysis of aged accounts while also factoring in any new business conditions that might impact the historical analysis, such as market conditions and bankruptcies of particular customers. Bad debt provisions are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nOur revolving credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets. Our borrowings under the revolving credit facility had a weighted-average interest rate of 4.44% as of December 31, 2017 (LIBOR plus an applicable margin, which was 3.00% as of December 31, 2017). Letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2017 totaled $6.7 million. The amount of availability under the revolving credit facility at February 21, 2018, after taking into consideration debt covenant restrictions, was $17.6 million. In connection with future acquisitions, the revolving credit facility requires, among other things, that we have, after giving effect to such acquisition, at least $20 million in the aggregate of borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and unrestricted cash on the balance sheet on the date of such acquisition. We are required to maintain a total leverage ratio (as defined in the revolving credit facility) for the most recently completed four fiscal quarters of less than or equal to 4.50 : 1.00, except for the quarter in which a material acquisition occurs and the first three full fiscal quarters following a material acquisition, generally defined as an acquisition with a purchase price of at least $30.0 million, with a ratio of 5.00 : 1.00, and a consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the revolving credit facility) of greater than or equal to 2.75 : 1.00. The computation of our total leverage ratio allows for a pro forma application of the EBITDA (as defined in the revolving credit facility) of acquired entities and was 4.14 : 1.00 as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with these financial covenant ratios.\n \u2022 A $254 million decline (95% of the total decline in Wholesale Segment operating revenues) attributable to a decrease in the wholesale price of our motor fuel. The average daily spot price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil decreased 11% to $43.29 per barrel during 2016, compared to $48.66 per barrel during 2015. The wholesale price of motor fuel is highly correlated to the price of crude oil. \nThe income statement includes the results of operations for each acquisition from their respective date of acquisition.\n \u2022 The $3.1 million decline in operating expenses was attributable to the conversion of company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites, partially offset by the impact of the March 2016 Franchised Holiday Stores acquisition and the 25 DMS sites being converted to commission agent sites in the fourth quarter of 2016. In the second quarter of 2017, some of these 25 sites were converted to lessee dealer sites, which resulted in the operating expenses being included in the wholesale segment rather than the retail segment. \nThe prices paid to our motor fuel suppliers for wholesale motor fuel (which affects our cost of sales) are highly correlated to the price of crude oil. The crude oil commodity markets are highly volatile, and the market prices of crude oil, and, correspondingly, the market prices of wholesale motor fuel, experience significant and rapid fluctuations. We receive a fixed mark-up per gallon on approximately 85% of gallons sold to our customers. The remaining gallons are primarily DTW priced contracts with our customers. These contracts provide for variable, market based pricing that results in motor fuel gross profit effects similar to retail motor fuel gross profits (as crude oil prices decline, motor fuel gross profit generally increases, as discussed in our Retail segment below). The increase in DTW gross profit results from the acquisition cost of wholesale motor fuel declining at a faster rate as compared to the rate retail motor fuel prices decline. Conversely, our DTW motor fuel gross profit declines when the cost of wholesale motor fuel increases at a faster rate as compared to the rate retail motor fuel prices increase.\nAcquisition of One Stop\nIncome from our investment in CST Fuel Supply increased $5.5 million as a result of the additional 12.5% equity interest we acquired in July 2015, partially offset by CST's sale of its California and Wyoming retail sites.\nRevenues from retail food and merchandise sales are recognized net of applicable provisions for discounts and allowances upon delivery, generally at the point of sale.\nCertain activities that generate non-qualifying income are conducted through our wholly owned taxable corporate subsidiary, LGWS. Current and deferred income taxes are recognized on the earnings of LGWS. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates.\nConcentration of Customers\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nWe account for business combinations in accordance with the guidance under ASC 805-Business Combinations. The purchase price is recorded for assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair value. The excess of the fair value of the consideration conveyed over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nRenegotiation of Rocky Top Purchase Obligation\nOur intersegment revenues decreased $116.9 million, primarily attributable to the declines in price and volume discussed above.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\n \u2022 Our motor fuel gross profit decreased $1.3 million attributable to a 15% decrease in margin per gallon as a result of the movement in crude oil prices throughout the two periods. See Significant Factors Affecting our Profitability-The Significance of Crude Oil and Wholesale Motor Fuel Prices on Our Revenues, Cost of Sales and Gross Profit.\u201d \nA business is defined as an integrated set of assets and activities that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors or other owners, members or participants. A business typically has inputs, processes applied to those inputs and outputs that are used to generate a return to investors, but outputs are not required for a set to be a business. A business must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs.\nSee Results of Operations-Segment Results\u201d for additional operating expenses analyses.\nIn July 2015, we completed the purchase of real property at 29 NTIs from CST in exchange for an aggregate consideration of approximately 0.3 million common units and cash in the amount of $124.4 million, with an aggregate consideration of $134.0 million on the date of closing. See Note 12 to the financial statements for additional information.\nWe expect our rent income to increase in 2018 based on our recent acquisitions and our expectation that we will continue to convert company operated retail sites to lessee dealers.\n \u2022 On September 6, 2017, we sold two properties to an unaffiliated third party as a result of the FTC's requirements associated with the Merger for $6.7 million. \nIn November 2015, the Board approved a common unit repurchase program under Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act authorizing us to repurchase up to an aggregate of $25 million of the common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership. Under the program, we may make purchases in the open market in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, or in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to a trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act or otherwise. Any purchases will be funded from available cash on hand. The common unit repurchase program does not require us to acquire any specific number of common units and may be suspended or terminated by us at any time without prior notice. The purchases will not be made from any officer, director or control person of the Partnership or CST. We did not repurchase any common units under the plan in 2017. The following table shows the purchases made through December 31, 2016:\nInterest expense increased $4.3 million due to additional borrowings during 2015 and 2016 to fund acquisitions.\nRetail\nThe payments in the table above represent payments on sale-leaseback transactions for which the sale was not recognized as a result of the continuing involvement with the sites. As such, the table above includes the payments under the lease.\nWholesale segment\nValuation allowances are initially recorded and reevaluated each reporting period by assessing the likelihood of the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset. We consider a number of factors in assessing the realization of a deferred tax asset, including the reversal of temporary differences, projections of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The amount of deferred tax assets ultimately realized may differ materially from the estimates utilized in the computation of valuation allowances and may materially impact the financial statements in the future.\nInterest expense\nAsset Acquisitions and Business Combinations\nWe typically experience lower retail motor fuel gross profits in periods when the wholesale cost of motor fuel increases, and higher retail motor fuel gross profits in periods when the wholesale cost of motor fuel declines.\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of $18.2 million and $0.5 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The benefit in 2017 was primarily due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which resulted in a net benefit of $13.2 million. In addition, as a result of a reassessment of the positive and negative evidence supporting whether or not a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is needed, we released the entire $3.7 million valuation allowance in 2017. See Note 19 for additional information.\nRegarding our supplier relationships, a majority of our total gallons purchased are subject to Terms Discounts. The dollar value of these discounts increases and decreases corresponding to motor fuel prices. Therefore, in periods of lower wholesale motor fuel prices, our gross profit is negatively affected and, in periods of higher wholesale motor fuel prices, our gross profit is positively affected (as it relates to these discounts).\nIn connection with the Rocky Top acquisition that we completed in September 2013, we entered into a deferred seller financing arrangement, which obligated us to purchase certain sites over a 5-year period for an average $5.2 million per year beginning in 2016 at an approximately 7.7% capitalization rate. In June 2016, we renegotiated the terms with the sellers, eliminating the deferred seller financing obligation and agreeing to terms of a new lease of the assets for an initial term of 15 years and eight months with four renewal options of five years each. Under this triple net lease, annual rent is initially $1.8 million based on a 6.5% capitalization rate and increases 1.5% per year. However, because of the continuing involvement we have with the sites through the lease and sublease of the properties, we recorded the liability on our balance sheet at fair value in June 2016, which approximated its carrying value. This sale-leaseback liability is classified within accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on the balance sheet.\nIn 2016, we paid $94.2 million in the Franchised Holiday Stores and State Oil Assets acquisitions and $2.9 million for independent dealer and sub-wholesaler contracts purchased from CST. We also incurred $20.8 million of capital expenditures and received $17.5 million in proceeds from the refund payment related to CST's sale of the California and Wyoming assets.\n\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion expense\nCommon Unit Repurchase Program\nOther Matters Impacting Liquidity and Capital Resources\nDuring 2017, the Partnership recognized a $5.4 million charge for certain severance and benefit costs associated with certain officers and other employees of CST Services who provided services to the Partnership and who terminated employment upon the consummation of the Merger, which constituted a change in control, as defined in the EICP and CST's severance plans. Such costs are included in general and administrative expenses and were primarily paid by Circle K in the third quarter of 2017. Accounts payable to related parties includes these costs as we will reimburse Circle K.\nManagement Fees\nThe following table highlights the results of operations and certain operating metrics of our Retail segment. The narrative following these tables provides an analysis of the results of operations of that segment (thousands of dollars, except for the number of retail sites and per gallon amounts):\n (a) Represents income from our equity interest in CST Fuel Supply. \n \u2022 A decrease of $124 million from a 24% decrease in motor fuel volumes sold related to the conversion of company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites during 2015 and 2016, partially offset by the incremental volume generated by the Franchised Holiday Stores acquisition. \nIn December 2016, we sold the real property at 17 sites acquired through the State Oil Assets asset acquisition for cash proceeds of $25.0 million, which were used to repay borrowings on the credit facility. We leased these properties for an initial term of 15 years with three renewal options of approximately five years each. Under the triple net lease, annual rent is initially $1.6 million based on a 6.5% capitalization rate and increases every five years based on inflation. Because of the continuing involvement we have with the sites through the lease and sublease of the properties, we recorded a liability for the proceeds received and are amortizing this liability over the lease term as rent payments are made. This sale-leaseback liability is classified within accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on the balance sheet.\nLegal Matters\nOn June 28, 2017, a wholly owned subsidiary of Circle K merged with and into CST, with CST surviving the Merger as an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Circle K. Circle K is a wholly owned subsidiary of Couche-Tard.\nIn the goodwill impairment test, the reporting unit's carrying amount (including goodwill) and its fair value are compared. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge is recognized for the deficit up to the amount of goodwill recorded.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\n \u2022 A $240 million, or 15%, increase in our Wholesale segment revenues primarily attributable to the increase in crude oil prices. The average daily spot price of WTI crude oil increased 17% to $50.78 per barrel in 2017, compared to $43.29 per barrel in 2016. The wholesale price of motor fuel is highly correlated to the price of crude oil. See Significant Factors Affecting our Profitability-The Significance of Crude Oil and Wholesale Motor Fuel Prices on Our Revenues, Cost of Sales and Gross Profit.\u201d \nSee Note 14 to the financial statements for a discussion of our environmental matters.\nSale Leaseback Obligations\nSeasonality Effects on Volumes\nIn 2015, we paid $167.8 million in the Landmark Assets, Erickson and One Stop acquisitions and $141.9 million on the acquisitions of CST's NTIs and CST Fuel Supply equity interests. We also had $10.2 million in capital expenditures.\nThe following MD&A is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. This section is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with Items 1., 1A. and 8. (which includes our consolidated financial statements) contained in this report.\nAs a limited partnership, we are not subject to federal and state income taxes. Income tax attributable to our taxable income, which may differ significantly from income for financial statement purposes, is assessed at the individual level of the unit holder. We are subject to a statutory requirement that non-qualifying income, as defined by the Internal Revenue Code, cannot exceed 10% of total gross income for the calendar year. If non-qualifying income exceeds this statutory limit, we would be taxed as a corporation. The non-qualifying income did not exceed the statutory limit in any period.\nInterest expense increased $5.2 million due to an increase in the average interest rate charged on our credit facility borrowings from 3.5% to 4.2% and additional borrowings to fund our recent acquisitions. In addition, we incurred $1.6 million of interest expense in 2017 related to our sale leaseback executed in December 2016.\nWe have certain retail site properties under capital leases. Capital lease obligations in the table above include both principal and interest.\nEnvironmental Matters\nThe following table presents reconciliations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Distributable Cash Flow to net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, for each of the periods indicated (in thousands, except for per unit amounts):\nSee Results of Operations-Segment Results\u201d for additional operating expenses analyses.\nCost of sales\nInterest expense\nRetail segment\nAcquisition of Jet-Pep Assets\nPartnership Common Unit Purchases by CST\nRent and other margin increased $13 million primarily as a result of our acquisition from CST of NTI retail sites in July 2015 and the State Oil Assets acquisition in September 2016, as well as converting company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites.\nThe Amended Omnibus Agreement contingently requires us to perform environmental remediation work as further discussed in Note 14 to the financial statements. We also have operating leases and motor fuel purchase commitments as previously discussed in Contractual Obligations\u201d and in Notes 13 and 15 to the financial statements.\nOperating expenses\nWe account for asset acquisitions (i.e. transactions involving the acquisition of a set of assets that does not meet the definition of a business) in accordance with the guidance under ASC 805-50 and other applicable guidance. Asset acquisitions are generally accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis. Two of the key differences in accounting for transactions as asset acquisitions as compared to business combination are summarized below:\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies.\nInflation affects our financial performance by increasing certain of our operating expenses and cost of goods sold. Operating expenses include labor costs, leases, and general and administrative expenses. While our Wholesale segment benefits from higher Terms Discounts as a result of higher fuel costs, inflation could negatively impact our Retail segment as a result of higher motor fuel, merchandise and operating costs. Although we have historically been able to pass on increased costs through price increases, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future.\n \u2022 Partially offsetting this decline was a $15 million increase primarily related to rental income associated with the acquisition from CST of NTI retail sites in July 2015 and the State Oil Assets acquisition as well as converting company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites. \nMotor fuel gross profit\n \u2022 New Accounting Policies-This section describes new accounting pronouncements that we have already adopted, those that we are required to adopt in the future and those that became applicable in the current year as a result of new circumstances. \nBelow is an analysis of our consolidated statements of income and provides the primary reasons for significant increases and decreases in the various income statement line items from period to period. Our consolidated statements of income are as follows (in thousands):\nThe amount of any distribution is subject to the discretion of the Board, which may modify or revoke our cash distribution policy at any time. Our Partnership Agreement does not require us to pay any distributions. As such, there can be no assurance we will continue to pay distributions in the future.\nSignificant Factors Affecting our Profitability\nRevenue Recognition\n (b) Relates to certain discrete acquisition related costs, such as legal and other professional fees, separation benefit costs and purchase accounting adjustments associated with recently acquired businesses. Acquisition-related costs for 2017 include certain separation benefit costs and retention bonuses paid to certain EICP participants associated with the Merger. Acquisition-related costs for 2017 also includes a $1.7 million charge related to a court ruling in favor of a former executive's claim to benefits under the EICP in connection with CST's acquisition of our General Partner. See Significant Factors Affecting our Profitability-Separation Benefits and Retention Bonuses\u201d for additional information. \nOperating revenues increased $225 million, or 12%, while gross profit increased $5.2 million, or 3.3%.\nThe following table reconciles our segment Adjusted EBITDA to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA presented in the table above (in thousands):\nOperating expenses\nGain on sales of assets, net\n (b) Please see the reconciliation of our segment's Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated net income under the heading Results of Operations-Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below. \nCritical accounting policies are those we believe are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because we must make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. We believe the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements.\nOperating revenues\nAt December 31, 2017, we had $89.1 million of goodwill recorded in our segments. After assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units exceed their carrying amounts and therefore goodwill is not impaired at December 31, 2017.\n\nExpiration of the Subordination Period\nThe results were driven by:\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, our environmental reserves recorded in the consolidated financial statements were $3.5 million and $4.2 million, respectively. These environmental reserves represent our estimates for future expenditures for remediation and related litigation associated with contaminated retail sites as a result of releases (e.g. overfills, spills and releases) and are based on current regulations, historical results and certain other factors.\nIntersegment revenues\nOperating expenses\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nFinancing Activities\nAccounts receivable primarily result from the sale of motor fuels to customers and rental fees for retail sites. The majority of our accounts receivable relate to motor fuel sales that can generally be described as high volume and low margin activities. Credit is extended to a customer based on an evaluation of the customer's financial condition. In certain circumstances collateral may be required from the customer. Receivables are recorded at face value, without interest or discount.\nWe recognize revenues from wholesale motor fuel sales when motor fuel is delivered to the customer. The purchase and delivery of motor fuels generally occurs on the same day. We recognize revenues from retail sales when motor fuel is sold to the customer. We record inventory from the time of the purchase of motor fuels from third party suppliers until the retail sale to the end customer.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $15.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015, driven primarily by incremental cash flow generated by our acquisitions. In addition, we settled $3.2 million more in management fees in equity with CST in 2016 compared to 2015.\nWhen we install or acquire USTs, we recognize the estimated future cost to remove our USTs over their estimated useful lives. We record a discounted liability for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation with a corresponding increase to the carrying value of the related long-lived asset at the time a UST is installed. We depreciate the amount added to property and equipment and recognize accretion expense in connection with the discounted liability over the remaining life of the UST.\nOutlook\nSignificant items impacting these results prior to the elimination of intercompany revenues were:\nIncome from CST Fuel Supply equity interests\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nCouche-Tard and CST Merger\n\nUnder the terms of various supply agreements, the Partnership is obligated to minimum volume purchases measured in gallons of motor fuel. Future minimum volume purchase requirements are 347 million gallons in 2018, reducing to 33 million gallons in 2022. Future minimum volume purchase requirements from 2023 through 2024 total 50 million gallons. The aggregate dollar amount of the future minimum volume purchase requirements is dependent on the future weighted average wholesale cost per gallon charged under the applicable supply agreements. The amounts and timing of the related payment obligations cannot reasonably be estimated reliably. As a result, payment of these amounts has been excluded from the table above. See Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information.\nIn January 2015, in connection with the joint acquisition by CST and CrossAmerica of 22 retail sites from Landmark Assets, we acquired the real property of the 22 fee sites for $41.2 million. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information.\nAcquisition of Franchised Holiday Stores\nOn July 7, 2016, in connection with the divestiture of certain California and Wyoming assets and the related decrease in supplied fuel volumes and as approved by the independent conflicts committee of the Board, CST provided a refund payment to the purchase price paid by us for our interest in CST Fuel Supply. The total refund payment received by us was approximately $18.2 million. See Note 12 to the financial statements for additional information.\nOperating expenses\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \u2022 In February 2015, we closed on the purchase of all of the outstanding capital stock of Erickson and certain related assets for an aggregate purchase price of $83.8 million, including working capital. \nOur business is subject to seasonality due to our wholesale and retail sites being located in certain geographic areas that are affected by seasonal weather and temperature trends and associated changes in retail customer activity during different seasons. Historically, sales volumes have been highest in the second and third quarters (during the summer months) and lowest during the winter months in the first and fourth quarters.\n \u2022 In July 2015, we closed on the purchase of retail sites from One Stop and certain related assets for $45.0 million, including working capital. \n (b) Please see the reconciliation of our segment's Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated net income (loss) under the heading Results of Operations-Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d \n \u2022 Significant Factors Affecting Our Profitability-This section describes the significant impact on our results of operations caused by crude oil commodity price volatility, seasonality and acquisition and financing activities. \nThe operating lease obligations include leases for land, office facilities and retail sites. Operating lease obligations reflected in the table above include all operating leases that have initial or remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases. In addition, such amounts do not reflect contingent rentals that may be incurred in addition to minimum rentals.\nDistribution activity for 2017 was as follows:\nThe following table summarizes cash flow activity (in thousands):\n (a) As approved by the independent conflicts committee of the Board, the Partnership, CST and Circle K mutually agreed to settle certain amounts due under the terms of the Amended Omnibus Agreement in limited partner units of the Partnership. \nAs a result of a reassessment of the positive and negative evidence supporting whether or not a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is needed, we released the entire $3.7 million valuation allowance in 2017. See Note 19 to the financial statements for additional information.\n \u2022 A decline of $45 million primarily attributable to a decrease in the retail price of our motor fuel driven by a decline in wholesale motor fuel prices as noted above. \n \u2022 Transaction costs are capitalized as a component of the cost of the assets acquired rather than expensed as incurred; \nOperating expenses increased $3.4 million primarily as a result of our September 2016 State Oil Assets acquisition, which is substantially offset by an increase in rent income, as well as our conversion of company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites throughout 2016 and 2017.\nRent and other gross profit\nDebt\nWholesale\n \u2022 On December 13, 2016, we amended our credit facility to provide additional flexibility to support achieving our growth strategy. \nIn 2016, we paid $83.6 million in distributions and purchased $3.3 million in common units under our common unit purchase program. We received $25.0 million in proceeds on the sale-leaseback transaction and had $83.1 million in net borrowings under our credit facility to fund our acquisitions.\nDistributions\nOther liabilities include asset retirement obligations described in Note 10 to the financial statements and exclude other liabilities whose payment period or amount is not determinable. For purposes of reflecting amounts for asset retirement obligations in the table above, we have made our best estimate of expected payments based on information available as of December 31, 2017.\n (d) On January 24, 2018, the Board approved a quarterly distribution of $0.6275 per unit attributable to the fourth quarter of 2017. The distribution is payable on February 12, 2018 to all unitholders of record on February 5, 2018. \nMD&A is organized as follows:\nContractual Obligations\nWe were a co-defendant, together with our General Partner, CST and CST Services LLC, in a lawsuit brought by a former executive of CST Services who, until March 2015, provided services to us as Chief Investment Officer and Vice President of Finance (Court of Common Pleas, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, case number 2015-1003). In connection with CST's acquisition of our General Partner in 2014, the plaintiff alleged breach of contract and associated claims relating to his termination of employment and claimed severance benefits under the EICP. In October 2017, a jury awarded the plaintiff a total of $1.7 million. Under the EICP, we were also obligated to pay reasonable legal expenses incurred by the plaintiff in connection with this dispute.\n (a) The inventory fair value adjustment represents the expensing of the step-up in value ascribed to inventory acquired in the Franchised Holiday Stores acquisition. \nSee Note 23 to the financial statements for financial and operating quarterly data for each quarter of 2017 and 2016.\nPurchase of NTI retail sites\nThe payments in the table above represent contractually obligated payments under the Amended Omnibus Agreement. See Note 12 to the financial statements for additional information.\n (f) The decrease in the DMS site count from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to the conversion of DMS sites to lessee dealer sites. \nCommon Unit Offering\nOperating Activities\nThese results were impacted by:\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion expense increased $3.1 million primarily driven by our recent acquisitions.\nPurchase of Wholesale Fuel Supply Contracts from CST\nResults of Operations\nOur results of operations and financial condition are also impacted by our acquisition and financing activities as summarized below.\nInvesting Activities\nMotor fuel gross profit\nCash Flows\nWe present the results of operations of our segments consistently with how our management views the business. Therefore, our segments are presented before intersegment eliminations (which consist of motor fuel sold by our Wholesale segment to our Retail segment). As a result, in order to reconcile to our consolidated change in operating revenues, a discussion of the change in intersegment revenues is included in our consolidated MD&A discussion.\nWe attempt to pass along wholesale motor fuel price changes to our retail customers through at the pump\u201d retail price changes; however, market conditions do not always allow us to do so immediately. The timing of any related increase or decrease in at the pump\u201d retail prices is affected by competitive conditions in each geographic market in which we operate. As such, the prices we charge our customers for motor fuel and the gross profit we receive on our motor fuel sales can increase or decrease significantly over short periods of time.\nAs a result of the Merger, Circle K indirectly owns all of the membership interests in the sole member of our General Partner, as well as a 21.1% limited partner interest in the Partnership and all of the outstanding IDRs of the Partnership. Circle K, through its indirect ownership interest in the sole member of our General Partner, has the ability to appoint all of the members of the Board and to control and manage the operations and activities of the Partnership.\nThe $4.7 million or 9% increase in motor fuel gross profit was primarily due to a higher margin per gallon realized primarily due to higher DTW margins as a result of the movements in crude prices throughout both periods and increased payment discounts and incentives due to the increase in motor fuel prices. The average daily spot price of WTI crude oil increased 17% to $50.78 per barrel for 2017, compared to $43.29 per barrel for 2016. See Significant Factors Affecting our Profitability-The Significance of Crude Oil and Wholesale Motor Fuel Prices on Our Revenues, Cost of Sales and Gross Profit.\u201d\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\n \u2022 An $11.0 million decline in operating expenses attributable to the conversion of company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites, partially offset by the impact of the Erickson, One Stop and Franchised Holiday Stores acquisitions. \nIf, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further testing is necessary. However, if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we perform the goodwill impairment test.\nSeparation Benefits and Retention Bonuses\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nChanges in our average motor fuel selling price per gallon and gross margin are directly related to the changes in crude oil and wholesale motor fuel prices. Variations in our reported revenues and cost of sales are, therefore, primarily related to the price of crude oil and wholesale motor fuel prices and generally not as a result of changes in motor fuel sales volumes, unless otherwise indicated and discussed below.\nIn July 2015, we closed on the purchase of retail sites from One Stop and certain related assets for $45.0 million, including working capital and net of cash acquired. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information.\nIn February 2015, we closed on the purchase of all of the outstanding capital stock of Erickson and certain related assets for an aggregate purchase price of $83.8 million, including working capital and net of cash acquired. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information.\nGross profit declined $22.5 million, while operating expenses declined $11.0 million.\nAcquisition of Erickson\nCost of sales increased $220 million or 13% as a result of the increase in wholesale motor fuel prices. See Results of Operations-Segment Results\u201d for additional gross profit analyses.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe believe that we will have sufficient cash flow from operations, borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility and access to capital markets and alternate sources of funding to meet our financial commitments, debt service obligations, contingencies, anticipated capital expenditures and partnership distributions. However, we are subject to business and operational risks that could adversely affect our cash flow. A material decrease in our cash flows would likely produce an adverse effect on our borrowing capacity as well as our ability to issue additional equity and/or debt securities.\nOperating revenues declined $356 million, or 16%, while gross profit declined $13.9 million, or 8%.\nOperating Lease Obligations\n \u2022 On February 5, 2016, we purchased independent dealer and sub-wholesaler contracts from CST for $2.9 million. \nWe review all accounts receivable balances on at least a quarterly basis and provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and on a specific identification basis.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our consolidated debt and capital lease obligations consisted of the following (in thousands):\nOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 are summarized below (in thousands):\nOperating expenses\nSuch amounts include estimates of interest expense related to our credit facility assuming a 4.5% interest rate.\nWe recognize revenue from leasing arrangements ratably over the term of the underlying lease. Renewals are not assumed unless reasonably assured.\n \u2022 A $29.5 million decrease as a result of the divestiture of low margin wholesale fuel supply contracts and other assets acquired in the PMI acquisition, partially offset by the impact of the Erickson, One Stop, Franchised Holiday Stores and State Oil Assets acquisitions. \nOperating expenses\nDuring 2017, we recorded a $2.2 million gain on the sale of two properties as required by the FTC in connection with the Merger and a $0.8 million gain on the sale of 29 properties to DMR. We also recorded a $0.8 million gain related to the renewal of a contract by DMS with one of its customers, which triggered an earn out payment to be paid by DMS to us in connection with a contract entered into with DMS at the time of CST's acquisition of our General Partner in October 2014.\n \u2022 In January 2015, we closed on the purchase of a 5% limited partner equity interest in CST Fuel Supply for approximately 1.5 million common units with an aggregate consideration of $60.0 million on the date of closing. \nOn March 29, 2016, we closed on the acquisition of 31 Franchise Holiday Stores and three company operated liquor stores from S/S/G Corporation for approximately $52.4 million, including working capital. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information.\n \u2022 On March 29, 2016, we closed on the acquisition of Franchised Holiday Stores and company operated liquor stores from S/S/G Corporation for approximately $52.4 million, including working capital. \nIn 2017, we paid $88.2 million in distributions and made net borrowings on our credit facility of $64.5 million.\nSignificant items impacting these results prior to the elimination of intercompany revenues were:\nIDRs\nThe decline of $1.1 million was primarily attributable to CST's July 2016 divestiture of its California and Wyoming retail sites and a decrease in volume driven by the impacts of Hurricane Harvey.\nRefund payment related to CST sale of California and Wyoming assets\nLGW collects motor fuel taxes, which consist of various pass through taxes collected from customers on behalf of taxing authorities, and remits such taxes directly to those taxing authorities. LGW's accounting policy is to exclude the tax collected and remitted from wholesale revenues and cost of sales and account for them as liabilities. LGWS's retail sales and cost of sales include motor fuel taxes as the taxes are included in the cost paid for motor fuel and LGWS has no direct responsibility to collect or remit such taxes to the taxing authorities.\nAcquisition of Landmark Assets\nThe following table highlights the results of operations and certain operating metrics of our Wholesale segment. The narrative following these tables provides an analysis of the results of operations of that segment (thousands of dollars, except for the number of distribution sites and per gallon amounts):\nLiquidity\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually, and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the goodwill might be impaired. The annual impairment testing date of goodwill is October 1.\nIn 2015, we received $144.9 million in net proceeds on equity offerings and $158.0 million in net borrowings under our credit facility to fund our acquisitions. We paid $66.1 million in distributions and purchased $3.6 million in common units under our common unit purchase program.\nAcquisition of State Oil Assets\n \u2022 A $37 million decline in our merchandise revenues attributable to the conversion of company operated retail sites to lessee dealer sites during 2015 and 2016, partially offset by the incremental merchandise revenues generated by the Franchised Holiday Stores acquisition. \nSegment Results\nWe present the results of operations of our segments consistent with how our management views the business. Therefore, our segments are presented before intersegment eliminations (which consist of motor fuel sold by our Wholesale segment to our Retail segment). These comparisons are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nSale Leaseback Transaction\nGross profit declined $5.0 million, while operating expenses declined $3.1 million.", "item_7_tables":
