MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of (i) industry operations that have an impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations, (ii) the Company's financial condition at December 31, 2016 and 2015 and its results of operations comparing the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and (iii) critical accounting policies used in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements. All dollar amounts are presented in thousands, except daily dollar amounts and per share amounts.\nGENERAL\nWe are a leading provider of energy transportation services, delivering crude oil and petroleum products. We own and operate a combined fleet of 24 vessels registered in the United States. Our well maintained fleet and commitment to high quality, incident-free service positions us as a preferred service provider of major oil companies and refiners.\nIncorporated in 1969, OSG has operated through multiple shipping cycles, making adjustments to our business as needed to compete and succeed. We provide safe, efficient and reliable transportation to customers and strive to ensure the highest standards of safety and environmental compliance throughout our organization.\nOur business operates as a single reportable segment. We believe that this is appropriate as our chief decision maker and our management team make decisions about resource allocations and review and measure our results as one line of business with similar regulatory requirements, customers and commodities transported. Our fleet includes tankers and ATBs, of which 22 operate under the Jones Act and two operate internationally and participate in the MSP. We own ten ATBs, which consist of eight vessels that transport primarily petroleum products and two that perform lightering operations in the Delaware Bay. We operate fourteen tankers, ten that have been chartered-in under operating leases and four that we own, including the two that participate in the MSP. Revenues are derived predominantly from time charter agreements, which provide a more predictable level of revenues. We derived approximately 17% of our total TCE revenues in the spot market for 2016.\nOn November 30, 2016, OSG completed the separation of its business into two independent publicly-traded companies through the spin-off of INSW. INSW holds entities and other assets and liabilities that formed OSG's former International Flag business, which was made up of two reportable segments - International Crude Tankers and International Product Carriers. In accordance with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, the assets and liabilities and results of operations of INSW are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Accordingly, all references made to financial data in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are to OSG's continuing operations, unless specifically noted.\nOPERATIONS AND OIL TANKER MARKETS\nThe Company's revenues are highly sensitive to patterns of supply and demand for vessels of the size and design configurations owned and operated by the Company and the trades in which those vessels operate. Rates for the transportation of crude oil and refined petroleum products are determined by market forces such as the supply and demand for oil. The demand for oil shipments is significantly affected by the state of the global economy, level of OPEC exports and oil production in the United States. The number of vessels is affected by newbuilding deliveries and by the removal of existing vessels from service, principally because of storage, scrappings or conversions. The Company's revenues are also affected by the mix of charters between spot (Voyage Charter) and long-term (Time or Bareboat Charter). Because shipping revenues and voyage expenses are significantly affected by the mix between voyage charters and time charters, the Company manages its vessels based on TCE revenues. Management makes economic decisions based on anticipated TCE rates and evaluates financial performance based on TCE rates achieved.\nEstimated TCE rates for prompt Jones Act Product Carriers and large ATBs decreased during the year ended December 31, 2016 from 2015 for each class of vessel. The decrease in 2016 compared with 2015 can be attributed to market uncertainty created by the decline in oil prices, the degree to which sustained low prices might cause U.S. crude oil production to decline further, and the increase in vessel supply.\nThe average monthly rate of production from the Eagle Ford formation decreased 410,000 b/d, or 28%, in December 2016 compared with December 2015. Eagle Ford crude is transported through pipeline infrastructure to Corpus Christi, where it is loaded on Jones Act vessels for transportation to refineries in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and the Philadelphia area. The reduction in production has led to the redeployment of a number of Jones Act vessels out of the crude trades into clean product trades, placing significant downward pressure on TCE rates. As of December 2016, 26% of the Jones Act tank vessel fleet deployment was in crude trades compared with 36% in December 2015. Jones Act tank vessel deployment in US Gulf clean product trades was 44% in December 2016 compared with 35% in December 2015. Adding to the impact of declining U.S. production was the lifting of the crude oil export ban on December 18, 2015.\nTable 220: <table><tr><td>38 </td> <td>Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 221: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2016, the industry's entire Jones Act fleet of Product Carriers and large ATBs (defined as vessels having carrying capacities of between 140,000 barrels and 350,000 barrels, which excludes numerous tank barges below 140,000-barrel capacity and 11 much larger tankers dedicated exclusively to the Alaskan crude oil trade) consisted of 90 vessels, compared with 79 vessels as of December 31, 2015. There were 12 deliveries and two vessels scrapped during 2016. The deliveries included eight Product Tankers and four ATBs. The scrapped vessels were two tankers, one of which was a late 1970s-built Alaskan crude tanker redeployed into the lower-48 coastwise trade during 2015, which was not part of the 79 vessel count noted above. In addition to the 90 vessels mentioned above, one late-1970s-built Alaskan crude tanker was sold by Exxon to competitors and redeployed into the lower-48 coastwise trade during 2015.\nThe industry's firm Jones Act orderbook as of December 31, 2016, with deliveries scheduled through the fourth quarter of 2017 consisted of nine vessels (five Product Carriers and four large ATBs). Options for an additional three ATBs remain open. The Company does not have any Jones Act vessels on order.\nDelaware Bay lightering volumes averaged 172,000 b/d in 2016 compared with 105,000 b/d in 2015. The increase resulted from imported crude oil becoming more economically attractive to Delaware Bay refiners compared with the cost of transporting domestically produced shale oil on vessels that do not require lightering services.\nRESULTS FROM VESSEL OPERATIONS\nTable 222: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td>

</tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2016, TCE revenues decreased by $2,898, or 1%, to $446,160 from $449,058 in 2015. A weakening Jones Act crude oil transportation market during the current year resulted in a decline in average daily rates earned by the Company's Jones Act ATBs and Jones Act Product Carriers, as well as increased spot market exposure, which accounted for a $16,204 decrease in revenue. The spot rates in the above table for Jones Act Product Carriers reflect idle days awaiting cargoes for one of the vessels that redelivered from a long-term charter in mid-June 2016. Offsetting this decrease to a large degree was (i) a 266-day increase in Jones Act ATB, Jones Act Product Carrier and Non-Jones Act Product Carrier revenue days, which accounted for a $11,175 increase in revenue, (ii) a $1,219 increase in Delaware Bay lightering revenue, and (iii) increased average daily rates for the Company's Non-Jones Act Product Carriers which accounted for a $911 increase in revenue. The increase in revenue days was principally attributable to a reduction in drydock and repair days in the current year. The increase in revenue earned by the Delaware Bay lightering vessels was primarily due to an increase in Delaware Bay lightering volumes and an 81-day decrease in drydock and repair days in the current year, partially offset by certain coastwise voyage opportunities that were available in the first half of 2015, but not in 2016.\nVessel expenses increased by $2,517 to $140,696 in 2016 from $138,179 in 2015, primarily due to an increase in average daily vessel expenses of $249 per day, which resulted principally from higher crew costs. Depreciation expense increased by $12,826 to $89,257 in 2016 from $76,431 in 2015 primarily as a result of the shortening of the useful lives of six of the Company's Jones Act ATBs effective October 1, 2015 and a further shortening of the useful lives of seven of the Jones Act ATBs effective October 1, 2016, as discussed further in Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nDuring 2015, TCE revenues increased by $34,685, or 8%, to $449,058 from $414,373 in 2014. Growth in the average daily rates earned by the Company's Jones Act Product Carriers and Jones Act ATBs accounted for $33,689 of such increase. This increase reflected the strength of the Jones Act market in 2015, which allowed the Jones Act Product Carriers and ATBs to generally achieve higher rates on new or extended time charters upon the expiry of existing time charters through the first half of 2015. Contributing to an increase in TCE revenues in the second half of 2015 was the June 2015 commencement of a ten-year time charter out entered into by one of the Company's Jones Act Product Carriers that had been converted into a shuttle tanker.\nVessel expenses increased by $3,100 to $138,179 in 2015 from $135,079 in 2014, primarily due to an increase in average daily vessel expenses of $654 per day, which resulted principally from higher crew costs. Depreciation expense increased by $9,847 to $76,431 in 2015 from $66,584 in 2014. Such increase reflects (i) the depreciation of costs incurred in 2014 to convert the conventional Jones Act Product Carrier referred to above into a shuttle tanker, (ii) the impact on amortization of drydock costs incurred during 2015, which were approximately $16,000 higher than drydock costs incurred during 2014 as more vessels were drydocked in 2015 and (iii) the reduction in useful lives of the Company's rebuilt Jones Act ATBs.\nTwo reflagged U.S. Flag Product Carriers participate in the U.S. Maritime Security Program, which ensures that privately-owned, military-useful U.S. Flag vessels are available to the U.S. Department of Defense in the event of war or national emergency. Each of the vessel-owning companies receives an annual subsidy, subject in each case to annual congressional appropriations, which is intended to offset the increased cost incurred by such vessels from operating under the U.S. Flag. In December 2015, the annual subsidy was increased and the Company expects to receive $5.0 million from 2017 through 2020, and $5.2 million beginning in 2021. As of December 31, 2016 funds had not been appropriated for the fiscal year 2017 vessel subsidy of $5.0 million. The Company does not receive the subsidy with respect to any days for which one or both of the vessels operate under a time charter to a U.S. government agency, which was the case for one vessel during the third quarter of 2016.\nTable 230: <table><tr><td>40 </td> <td>Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 231: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nDuring 2016, general and administrative expenses decreased by $19,932 to $41,608 from $61,540 in 2015. This decrease reflects: (i) lower compensation and benefit costs of $5,501 primarily due to a decrease in incentive compensation; and (ii) a net decrease in legal, accounting and consulting fees aggregating $16,198, as the prior period reflected higher costs incurred in the period subsequent to the Company's emergence from bankruptcy.\nDuring 2015, general and administrative expenses increased by $9,117 to $61,540 from $52,423 in 2014. The increase primarily reflects the following: (i) higher legal, consulting and accounting fees aggregating $8,873 resulting from higher costs incurred in the period subsequent to the Company's emergence from bankruptcy; (ii) higher compensation and benefit expenses aggregating $2,485 mostly related to employee bonus programs, including certain retention programs put in place as a result of the Company's bankruptcy filing and an increase in share-based compensation; and (iii) a reduction in costs allocated and directly attributable to INSW aggregating $1,003. These increases were partially offset by lower insurance premiums of $2,964 as the 2014 period included an increase in liability insurance, principally related to the acceleration of Directors and Officers liability insurance costs in the third quarter of 2014, since the then existing coverage ended upon the Company's emergence from bankruptcy, and a one-time premium paid in the third quarter of 2014 for runoff coverage for the former directors and officers of the Company and the removal of certain exclusions in such policy.\nINTEREST EXPENSE\nThe components of interest expense are as follows:\nTable 232: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest before impact of interest rate caps </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,812 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>70,364 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>176,234 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Impact of interest rate caps </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>339 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,151 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>70,365 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>176,234 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense, including administrative and other fees was $43,151 for 2016 compared with $70,365 in 2015. The decrease in interest expense associated with the Company's Exit Financing Facilities and Unsecured Senior Notes from the prior year reflects the impact of the Company's repurchases and prepayments of $137,295 in aggregate principal amount of its OBS Term Loan in 2016 and the repurchase of $363,690 in aggregate principal amount of its outstanding Unsecured Senior Notes between the third quarter of 2015 and September 2016. Refer to Note 9, Debt,\u201d in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nInterest expense, including administrative and other fees, was $70,365 in 2015 and comprised primarily of $32,669 associated with the Company's reinstated Unsecured Senior Notes and $37,666 relating to the Exit Financing Facility.\nInterest expense in 2014 reflects interest expense of $176,234, including contractual post-petition interest from the Petition Date through the effective date of the Equity Plan of $106,400 associated with the Company's Unsecured Senior Notes and $15,282 associated with the Company's Exit Financing Facilities. The balance of interest expense recognized during 2014 represented contractual post-petition interest from the Petition Date through the effective date of the Equity Plan on allowed claims associated with our pre-reorganized OSG loan agreements (excluding reinstated Unsecured Senior Notes) and certain rejected executory contracts. Accordingly, interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 is not comparable to either 2016 or 2015.\nINCOME TAX BENEFIT FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS\nThe effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were 98.4%, 493.7% and 44.8%, respectively. The Company's effective tax rates are affected by recurring items, such as permanent differences (and their relative amount versus income) and discrete items that may occur in one year but are not consistent from year to year.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, our effective tax rate decreased compared with the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of the absence of the tax benefit attributable to the Pre-Filing Agreement with the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d) in 2015, offset in part by the reversal of the deferred tax liability associated with the Company's investment in INSW.\nIn January 2015, the Company requested that the IRS review under its Pre-Filing Agreement Program the deductibility of certain payments made by OSG in 2014, in the aggregate amount of $477,835, in its capacity as guarantor of the obligations of subsidiaries of INSW under certain loan agreements. In connection with these payments, the Company had established an unrecognized tax benefit equal to the full amount of such benefits, or $179,151 as of December 31, 2014. On September 4, 2015, the Company received an executed closing agreement from the IRS, which allowed a deduction of $424,523. As a result of the closing agreement, the Company reduced its reserve for uncertain tax positions by $179,151, recognized an income tax benefit of $150,073 and reduced its deferred tax asset for net operating loss carryforwards by $29,078 during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nTable 233: <table><tr><td>41 </td> <td>Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 234: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs a result of the aforementioned closing agreement, OSG's investment in INSW for financial reporting purposes exceeded its tax basis, and as of December 31, 2015, management did not believe it could make an assertion that OSG's investment in INSW was essentially permanent in duration. Accordingly, the Company recognized a deferred tax liability and tax provision of $48,856 for the year ended December 31, 2015 on the accumulated and current year undistributed earnings of its foreign operations, aggregating approximately $138,881, arising principally from companies domiciled in the Marshall Islands.\nAs of December 31, 2016, as a result of the spin-off of INSW, the Company reversed its deferred tax liability in the amount of $48,856 recognized on the basis difference in its investment in INSW as the Spin-off resulted in a non-deductible taxable loss on the Company's investment in INSW.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $308,289, which are available to reduce future taxes, if any. The federal net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2034. The amount of net operating loss carryforwards reflected in this paragraph are presented on a tax return basis and differ from the amounts reflected in the balance sheet, which are reflected net of unrecognized tax benefits.\nIn connection with the emergence from bankruptcy, under applicable U.S. tax regulations, the Company underwent an ownership change. As a result, there is an annual limitation on the use of pre-ownership change net operating losses, tax credits and certain other tax attributes to offset taxable income earned after the ownership change. The annual limitation is equal to the product of the applicable long-term tax exempt rate and the value of the Company's stock immediately before the ownership change. This annual limitation may be adjusted to reflect any unused annual limitation for prior years and certain recognized built-in gains and losses for the year. The Company does not believe that the limitations imposed will impact its ability to utilize pre-ownership change net operating losses before the carryforward period expires.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our effective tax rate increased by approximately 449% compared with the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily as a result of the Pre-Filing Agreement with the IRS offset in part by the deferred tax liability recognized on the Company's investment in INSW.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company repaid the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, for which INSW was liable on a joint and several basis. As a result, because INSW was no longer liable on a joint and several basis for the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company released its deferred tax liability for undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries attributable to the excess Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility over the cumulative potential deemed dividends arising from the drawdowns by OSG under such facility, and recorded an income tax benefit of $55,602. As of December 31, 2014, the Company's tax basis in its investment in INSW exceeded the book basis of such investment and the Company therefore did not record any deferred tax asset for the unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries.\nThe Company is currently undergoing an examination by the Internal Revenue Service of its 2012 through 2015 tax returns.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA represents net (loss)/income from continuing operations before interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA consists of EBITDA adjusted for the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented to provide investors with meaningful additional information that management uses to monitor ongoing operating results and evaluate trends over comparative periods. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent, and should not be considered a substitute for, net income or cash flows from operations determined in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations are:\nTable 235: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhile EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by companies as a measure of operating results and performance, neither of those items as prepared by the Company is necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to differences in methods of calculation.\nTable 236: <table><tr><td>42 </td> <td>Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 237: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table reconciles net income/(loss) from continuing operations, as reflected in the consolidated statements of operations set forth in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\nTable 238: <table> <tr> <td>For the year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net (loss)/income from continuing operations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,059 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>80,565 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(143,206 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income tax benefit from continuing operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(65,098 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(101,032 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(115,552 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,151 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,365 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>176,234 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89,563 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76,851 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,547 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>EBITDA </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66,557 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>126,749 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14,977 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Severance costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,996 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,161 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss/(gain) on disposal of vessels and other property, including impairments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>104,532 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(578 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss on repurchase of debt </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,988 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,516 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other costs associated with repurchase of debt </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,099 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Write-off of registration statement costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,493 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Reorganization items, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,925 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,052 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>153,125 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>176,225 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>168,116 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>139,731 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nOn November 30, 2016, we completed the spinoff of INSW, which previously made up our International Crude Tankers and International Product Carriers reportable segments. The results of INSW have been classified as discontinued operations. See Note 5, Discontinued Operations,\u201d to the Company's consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 for additional information.\nResults from Vessel Operations\nThe following is a discussion of the results from vessel operations of the INSW discontinued operations for the eleven months ended November 30, 2016, and for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nDuring the eleven months ended November 30, 2016, results from vessel operations of discontinued operations decreased by $499,804 to a loss of $298,911 from income of $200,893 in the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease reflects the impact of net held-for-sale basis and held-for-use basis impairments of $332,562 and $49,640, respectively, declining TCE revenues, and the incurrence of spin-off related costs in 2016. Such impacts were partially offset by a decrease in vessel expenses, depreciation and amortization, and charter hire in the 2016 period.\nTCE revenues decreased in 2016 by $121,889, or 26%, to $353,901 from $475,790 in 2015. The decrease was principally as a result of a weakening in rates throughout the International Flag sectors, most significantly in the MR, VLCC, Aframax and LR2 fleets. Further contributing to the decrease was a 1,226-day decrease in revenue days, primarily as a result of (i) the 2016 period only including 11 months and (ii) a decrease in MR revenue days, as a result of the sale of a 1998-built MR in July 2015 and the redelivery of an MR to its owners at the expiry of its time charter in March 2015. The negative factors were partially offset by 477 fewer drydock and repair days in the 2016 period and an increase in revenue from the Company's ULCC being taken out of lay-up in the first quarter of 2015.\nThe decreases in vessel expenses, depreciation and amortization and charter hire during the 2016 period are principally as a result of factors impacting revenue days described above.\nDuring 2015, income from vessel operations improved by $172,436 to $200,893 from $28,457 in 2014. This increase reflects the impact of a significant strengthening of TCE revenues, declining charter hire expense, and decreases in depreciation and amortization, severance and technical management transition costs and general and administrative expense. Such impacts were partially offset by a period-over-period increase in vessel expenses and a reduction in gains on vessel sales in the current year.\nTCE revenues increased in 2015 by $128,803, or 37%, to $475,790 from $346,987 in 2014. The increase was primarily due to a strengthening of rates in all of the International Flag sectors, most significantly in the VLCC and MR fleets. These positive factors were partially offset by a 3,700-day decrease in revenue days during 2015, which was driven by (i) fewer chartered-in days in the current year, (ii) the Company's reduced participation in the full service International Flag Lightering business upon the expiry of its lightering contracts in September 2014, and (iii) the sale of two VLCCs and one Panamax in December 2014, and one MR in July 2015.\nTable 239: <table><tr><td>43 </td> <td>Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 240: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in charter hire expense in 2015 compared with 2014 was principally the result of the redeliveries of ten vessels (eight Aframaxes, one Suezmax and one MR) at the expiry of their short-term time charters in 2014. Also contributing to the decrease was the redelivery of one additional MR upon its time charter's expiration in March 2015.\nThe increase in 2015 vessel expenses resulted primarily from (i) reactivation and operating costs incurred in conjunction with the Company's ULCC being taken out of lay-up in the first quarter of 2015 and commencing a time charter in April 2015, (ii) incremental costs relating to the redelivery of one of the Company's Panamaxes that had previously been bareboat chartered-out, (iii) the recording of a $1,450 reserve in 2015 for an assessment by a multi-employer defined benefit pension plan covering British crew members that served onboard INSW vessels (as well as vessels of other owners) more than 20 years ago, (iv) the Company taking delivery of a newbuild LR2 in the second quarter of 2014, and (v) technical management fees paid to V.Ships. The Company began transferring management of its International Flag conventional tankers to V.Ships in March 2014 and completed the transfers by September of 2014. Vessel operating expenses in 2015 included approximately $7,200 in technical management fees, compared with approximately $4,100 in 2014. These increases in vessel expense were more than offset by a decrease in the cost of providing technical and commercial management by the Company's shore-based staff that were previously included in general and administrative expenses.\nThe decrease in depreciation and amortization in 2015 compared with 2014 was primarily due to the vessel sales noted above. This decrease was partially offset by the impact of the LR2 newbuild delivery referred to above.\nImpact of Spin off\nAs discussed in Note 5, Discontinued Operations,\u201d to the Company's consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d the accounting for the distribution of nonmonetary assets to owners of an entity in a spinoff should be based on the recorded amount (after reduction, if appropriate, for an indicated impairment of value). The nonmonetary distribution of the assets of INSW constituted the disposal of a business. Accordingly, OSG's distribution of the shares of INSW to its shareholders on November 30, 2016 was recorded based on the carrying value of the INSW disposal group, after reduction for $332,562 in net impairment charges recognized for the excess of the carrying value of the INSW disposal group over its fair value, calculated on a held for sale basis. Such impairment charges are included in the results from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2016. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies - Vessel and Investment in Joint Venture Impairments - Held for Sale Basis (Disposal Group) below for additional information on management's judgments and estimates in determining the impairment charge for the INSW disposal group.\nLIQUIDITY AND SOURCES OF CAPITAL\nOur business is capital intensive. Our ability to successfully implement our strategy is dependent on the continued availability of capital on attractive terms. In addition, our ability to successfully operate our business to meet near-term and long-term debt repayment obligations is dependent on maintaining sufficient liquidity.\nLiquidity\nWorking capital from continuing operations at December 31, 2016 was approximately $181,000 compared with $110,000 at December 31, 2015. Current assets are highly liquid, consisting principally of cash, interest-bearing deposits and receivables. The Company's total cash (including restricted cash) increased by approximately $2,372 during 2016. Such increase resulted from positive cash from continuing operations, $202,000 of dividends received from INSW, and proceeds from the Proskauer litigation settlement, which is net of (i) all related out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Company during the three months ended March 31, 2016 and (ii) related amounts paid to the class action plaintiffs. These inflows were offset in part by the use of cash for repurchases and principal prepayments on outstanding debt and repurchases of outstanding Class A common stock and Class A warrants during 2016, as discussed further below.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had total liquidity on a consolidated basis of $281,933, comprised of $206,933 of cash (including $15,844 of restricted cash) and $75,000 of undrawn revolver capacity. We manage our cash in accordance with our intercompany cash management system subject to the requirements of our Exit Financing Facilities. Our cash and cash equivalents, as well as our restricted cash balances, generally exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limits. We place our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in what we believe to be credit-worthy financial institutions. In addition, certain of our money market accounts invest in U.S. Treasury securities or other obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, or its agencies.\nTable 241: <table><tr><td>44 </td> <td>Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 242: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement has designated cash reserves of $5,576 as of December 31, 2016 (compared with $10,583 at December 31, 2015) to be utilized within the next twelve months for the settlement of certain unsecured claims related to the Company's emergence from bankruptcy, $5 million of which was paid on February 27, 2017. The remainder of such restricted cash reserves will be used to settle claims or released in 2017. Additionally, restricted cash as of December 31, 2016 includes approximately $10,268 of legally restricted cash relating to the Unsecured Senior Notes, $1,696 of which is classified within current assets. The remaining $8,572 is included in non-current assets. The OBS Term Loan required that upon the spin-off of INSW the Company set aside in an escrow account (1) all accrued and unpaid interest on the existing Unsecured Senior Notes through the date of the consummation of the INSW spin-off and (2) all interest expense that will accrue under the respective existing Unsecured Senior Notes from the date of the consummation of the INSW spin-off through the maturity of the respective existing Unsecured Senior Notes.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had total debt outstanding (net of original issue discount and deferred finance costs) of $525,082 and a total debt to total capitalization of 67.4%. Our debt profile reflects recent actions (discussed further below) to deleverage our balance sheet as well as no scheduled amortization requirements before 2018.\nSources, Uses and Management of Capital\nWe generate significant cash flows from our complementary mix of time charters, voyage charters and contracts of affreightment. Net cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2016 was $328,860. In addition to operating cash flows, our other current sources of funds are proceeds from issuances of equity securities, additional borrowings as permitted under the Exit Financing Facilities and proceeds from the opportunistic sales of our vessels. In the past we have also obtained funds from the issuance of long-term debt securities. We may in the future complete transactions consistent with achieving the objectives of our business plan.\nOur current uses of funds are to fund working capital requirements, maintain the quality of our vessels, comply with U.S. and international shipping standards and environmental laws and regulations, repay or repurchase our outstanding loan facilities and to repurchase our common stock from time to time. The OBS Term Loan Facility requires that a portion of Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the term loan agreement) be used to prepay the outstanding principal balance of the term loan, commencing with the annual period beginning January 1, 2015. Management determined that no incremental prepayments will be required for the OBS Term Loan Facility for 2017 as the voluntary prepayment made during the fourth quarter of 2016 exceeded any prepayments which would have been required under the OBS Term Loan Facility for 2017. To the extent permitted under the terms of the OBS Term Loan, we may also use cash generated by operations to finance capital expenditures to modernize and grow our fleet.\nHistorically, we have also used funds to pay dividends and to repurchase our common stock from time to time. Pursuant to the October 2015 Board resolution authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $200,000 worth of the Company's Class A and Class B common stock and warrants, we repurchased 106,350 shares of Class A common stock at an aggregate cost of $1,301. In addition, during 2016, we repurchased 55,306,351 Class A warrants at an aggregate cost of $118,041.\nOn February 29, 2016, the Board declared a cash dividend of $0.08 per share on its Class A and Class B common stock. This dividend, totaling $30,573, was paid on March 25, 2016. The declaration and timing of future cash dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of the Board and will depend upon, among other things, our future operations and earnings, capital requirements, general financial condition, contractual restrictions and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant.\nDuring 2016, we repurchased and retired $294 of our outstanding 2024 Notes and $37,345 of our 2018 Notes. Also, during 2016, OBS opportunistically repurchased and retired $27,000 of the outstanding principal under the OBS Term Loan at a discounted price of $23,584. During the year ended December 31, 2016, OBS also made optional and mandatory principal prepayments of $59,000 and $51,295, respectively.\nThe Parent Company's ability to receive cash dividends, loans or advances from OBS is restricted under its loan facility. The Available Amount for cash dividends, loans or advances to the Parent Company permitted under the OBS Term Loan was $0 as of December 31, 2016, after OBS's dividend distributions to the Parent Company of $51,295 during 2016. Management expects that the Available Amount will increase to $93,592 by the end of the first quarter of 2017, after the required reports are filed with the banks.\nOutlook\nWe believe the actions we have taken have strengthened our balance sheet and at the same time positioned us to generate sufficient cash to support our operations over the next twelve months. The Company currently plans to pay off or refinance the outstanding principal balance on its 8.125% Notes, which mature on March 30, 2018, by December 29, 2017.\nOn June 2, 2016, the Board authorized the Company to take action to transfer the listing of its Class A common stock to the New York Stock Exchange from the NYSE MKT. In conjunction with the Transfer, the Board approved the Reverse Split Amendment to the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The Reverse Split Amendment effected a one (1) for six (6) reverse stock split and corresponding reduction of the number of authorized shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. On June 7, 2016, the Company filed the Reverse Split Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Reverse Split Amendment became effective on June 13, 2016. As previously reported, the Company's stockholders approved the filing of the Reverse Split Amendment at the Company's annual meeting of stockholders held on June 9, 2015. The Transfer was approved by the New York Stock Exchange on June 23, 2016.\nTable 243: <table><tr><td>45 </td> <td>Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 244: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEffective as of 5:00 p.m., New York time, on November 30, 2016 (the Distribution Date\u201d), OSG completed the separation of its business into two independent publicly-traded companies through the spin-off of INSW. The spin-off separates OSG and INSW into two distinct business with separate management. OSG has retained the U.S. Flag business and INSW holds entities and other assets and liabilities that formed OSG's former International Flag business.\nThe spin-off transaction was in the form of a pro rata distribution of INSW common stock to OSG's stockholders and warrant holders of record as of the close of business on November 18, 2016 (the Record Date.\u201d) On the Distribution Date, each holder of OSG common stock received 0.3333 shares of INSW common stock for every share of OSG common stock held on the Record Date. Each holder of OSG warrants received 0.3333 shares of INSW common stock for every one share of OSG common stock they would have received if they exercised their warrants immediately prior to the Distribution (or 0.063327 INSW shares per warrant).\nThe spin-off was completed pursuant to a Separation and Distribution Agreement and several other agreements with OSG related to the spin-off, including a Transition Services Agreement and an Employee Matters Agreement. These agreements govern the relationship between us and OSG following the spin-off and provide for the allocation of various assets, liabilities, rights and obligations. These agreements also include arrangements for transition services to be provided by OSG to INSW and by INSW to OSG.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn accordance with the Separation and Distribution Agreement, subsequent to the November 30, 2016 spin-off of INSW, OSG will continue to guarantee debt and other obligations of certain of INSW's equity method investees. The debt and other obligations are primarily due to banks in connection with financing the purchase and conversion of vessels and equipment used in the joint venture operations. As of December 31, 2016, the maximum potential amount of future principal payments (undiscounted) that OSG could be required to make relating to such equity method investees secured bank debt and interest rate swaps was $38,789 and the carrying amount of the liability related to this guarantee was $0. In connection with the continuing OSG guarantees, INSW will pay a $125 fee per year to OSG, which is subject to escalation after 2017. INSW has indemnified OSG for liabilities arising from the continuing OSG guarantees pursuant to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement.\nCarrying Value of Vessels\nTwelve of the Company's owned vessels are pledged as collateral under the Exit Financing Facilities. The carrying value of each of the Company's vessels does not necessarily represent its fair market value or the amount that could be obtained if the vessel were sold.\nThe Company believes that the availability, quality and reliability of fair market valuations of U.S Flag vessels are limited given the fact that the U.S. Flag market is relatively small and illiquid with very limited second hand sales and purchases activity from which to benchmark vessel values. As discussed in Note 6, Vessels, Deferred Drydock and Other Property,\u201d to the Company's consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d the Company monitors for any indicators of impairment in regards to the carrying value of its vessels.\nTable 245: <table><tr><td>46 </td> <td>Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 246: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAggregate Contractual Obligations\nA summary of the Company's long-term contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 follows:\nTable 247: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Beyond </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Long-term debt (1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unsecured senior notes - fixed rate </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,683 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>84,987 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>342 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>462 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92,578 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>OBS term loan - floating rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,168 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,168 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>473,415 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>521,751 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating lease obligations (2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Bareboat Charter-ins </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91,576 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91,457 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>111,819 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,168 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,143 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,864 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>345,027 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Office space </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>526 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>539 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>568 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>538 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>538 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>931 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,640 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>122,953 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>201,151 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>585,854 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,758 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>962,996 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)\tAmounts shown include contractual interest obligations.

The Company manages this exposure to market risk through its regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. To manage its interest rate risk in a cost-effective manner, the Company, from time-to-time, enters into interest rate swap or cap agreements, in which it agrees to exchange various combinations of fixed and variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts or to receive payments if floating interest rates rise above a specified cap rate. The Company uses such derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes. In addition, derivative financial instruments are entered into with a diversified group of major financial institutions in order to manage exposure to nonperformance on such instruments by the counterparties.\nAt December 31, 2016, OBS was party to an interest rate cap agreement ( Interest Rate Cap\u201d) with a date of February 15, 2015 with major financial institutions covering the notional amount of $375,000, to limit the floating interest rate exposure associated with its term loan. This agreement contains no leverage features. The OBS Interest Rate Cap has a cap rate of 2.5% through February 5, 2017, at which time the cap rate increases to 3.0% through the termination date of February 5, 2018.\nTable 251: <table><tr><td>47 </td> <td>Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 252: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nINTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY\nThe following table presents information about the Company's financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates.

There were no amounts outstanding under the OBS ABL Facility as of December 31, 2016.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require the Company to make estimates in the application of its accounting policies based on the best assumptions, judgments, and opinions of management. Following is a discussion of the accounting policies that involve a higher degree of judgment and the methods of their application. For a description of all of the Company's material accounting policies, see Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the Company's consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nRevenue Recognition\nThe majority of revenue is generated from time charters and is accounted for as operating leases and are thus recognized ratably over the rental periods of such charters, as service is performed. The Company does not recognize time charter revenues during periods that vessels are off hire.\nThe Company generates a portion of its revenue from voyage charters. Within the shipping industry, there are two methods used to account for voyage charter revenue: (1) ratably over the estimated length of each voyage and (2) completed voyage. The recognition of voyage revenues ratably over the estimated length of each voyage is the most prevalent method of accounting for voyage revenues in the shipping industry and the method used by OSG. Under each method, voyages may be calculated on either a load-to-load or discharge-to-discharge basis. In applying its revenue recognition method, management believes that the discharge-to-discharge basis of calculating voyages more accurately estimates voyage results than the load-to-load basis. Since, at the time of discharge, management generally knows the next load port and expected discharge port, the discharge-to-discharge calculation of voyage revenues can be estimated with a greater degree of accuracy. OSG does not begin recognizing voyage revenue until a charter has been agreed to by both the Company and the customer, even if the vessel has discharged its cargo and is sailing to the anticipated load port on its next voyage, because it is at this time the charter rate is determinable for the specified load and discharge ports and collectability is reasonably assured.\nVessel Lives and Salvage Values\nThe carrying value of each of the Company's vessels represents its original cost at the time it was delivered or purchased less depreciation calculated using an estimated useful life of 25 years (except for new ATBs for which estimated useful lives of 30 years are used) from the date such vessel was originally delivered from the shipyard or 20 years from the date the Company's ATBs were rebuilt. A vessel's carrying value is reduced to its new cost basis (i.e. its current fair value) if a vessel impairment charge is recorded.\nTable 254: <table><tr><td>48 </td> <td>Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 255: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf the estimated economic lives assigned to the Company's vessels prove to be too long because of new regulations, an extended period of weak markets, the broad imposition of age restrictions by the Company's customers, or other future events, it could result in higher depreciation expense and impairment losses in future periods related to a reduction in the useful lives of any affected vessels. In evaluating various impairment indicators that existed at September 30, 2015 (as discussed below under Vessel Impairment) management believed at that time that it was more likely than not that the Company would scrap six of its rebuilt ATBs at the time of their next scheduled drydock special survey date rather than make the significant capital expenditures necessary to comply with regulatory requirements. Accordingly, the remaining useful lives for such ATBs were adjusted on a prospective basis beginning on October 1, 2015. This reduction in useful lives increased depreciation expense on these vessels by approximately $3,600 per quarter. During the third quarter of 2016, management evaluated various impairment indicators that existed at the end of such period and as a result, determined that it was more likely than not that the Company would scrap seven of its rebuilt ATBs prior to their then estimated disposal date as described above. Accordingly, the remaining useful lives for such ATBs were further adjusted. This reduction in useful lives negatively impacted depreciation expense attributable to the ATB vessel impairments discussed in Note 6, Vessels, Deferred Drydock and Other Property,\u201d by approximately $2,200 per quarter beginning on October 1, 2016.\nThe United States has not adopted the Hong Kong International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships (the Convention\u201d). While the Convention is not in effect in the United States, the EPA and the Maritime Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation ( MarAd\u201d) have, from time to time, required the owners of U.S. Flag vessels to make certifications regarding the presence of certain toxic substances onboard vessels that they are seeking to sell to parties who (a) are not citizens of the United States and (b) intend to recycle the vessels after they have been purchased (the \"Recycling Purchasers\"). In the event that more stringent requirements are imposed upon the owners of U.S. Flag vessels seeking to sell their vessels to the Recycling Purchasers, such requirements could (a) negatively impact the sales prices obtainable from the Recycling Purchasers or (b) require companies, including OSG, to incur additional costs in order to sell their U.S. Flag vessels to the Recycling Purchasers or to other foreign buyers intending to use such vessels for further trading. Management currently believes that $300 per lightweight ton is a reasonable estimate of recycling prices for OSG's U.S. Flag vessels.\nVessel Impairment\nThe carrying values of the Company's vessels may not represent their fair market value or the amount that could be obtained by selling the vessel at any point in time since the market prices of second-hand vessels tend to fluctuate with changes in charter rates and the cost of newbuildings. Historically, both charter rates and vessel values tend to be cyclical. Management evaluates the carrying amounts of vessels held and used by the Company for impairment only when it determines that it will sell a vessel or when events or changes in circumstances occur that cause management to believe that future cash flows for any individual vessel will be less than its carrying value. In such instances, an impairment charge would be recognized if the estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the vessel and its eventual disposition is less than the vessel's carrying amount. This assessment is made at the individual vessel level as separately identifiable cash flow information for each vessel is available.\nIn developing estimates of future cash flows, the Company must make assumptions about future performance, with significant assumptions being related to charter rates, ship operating expenses, utilization, drydocking requirements, residual value and the estimated remaining useful lives of the vessels. These assumptions are based on historical trends as well as future expectations. Specifically, in estimating future charter rates, management takes into consideration rates currently in effect for existing time charters and estimated daily time charter equivalent rates for each vessel class for the unfixed days over the estimated remaining lives of each of the vessels. The estimated daily time charter equivalent rates used for unfixed days beyond the expiry of any current time charters are based on internally forecasted rates that take into consideration average annual rates published by a third party maritime research service and are consistent with forecasts provided to the Company's senior management and Board of Directors. The internally forecasted rates are based on management's evaluation of current economic data and trends in the shipping and oil and gas industries. Recognizing that the transportation of crude oil and petroleum products is cyclical and subject to significant volatility based on factors beyond the Company's control, management believes the use of estimates based on the internally forecasted rates to be reasonable.\nEstimated outflows for operating expenses and drydocking requirements are based on historical and budgeted costs and are adjusted for assumed inflation. Finally, utilization is based on historical levels achieved and estimates of a residual value are consistent with the pattern of scrap rates used in management's evaluation of salvage value.\nIn estimating the fair value of vessels for the purposes of step 2 of the impairment tests, the Company utilizes estimates of discounted future cash flows for each of the vessels (income approach) since the secondhand sale and purchase market for the type of U.S. Flag vessels owned by OSG is not considered to be robust.\nTable 256: <table><tr><td>49 </td> <td>Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 257: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company considered changes in circumstances that appeared to be indicative of a continued weakening of the Jones Act crude oil transportation market during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. Such indicators included a decline in the number of Jones Act tank vessels transporting crude oil, which led to (i) increased competition for clean cargoes and the idling of some Jones Act vessels; (ii) a sharp decrease in estimated spot rates for Jones Act Product Carriers and large ATBs between July and September 2016; and (iii) a significant decline in forecasted near term TCE rates reported by a leading third party industry analyst. These factors were viewed as an impairment trigger event for the Company's eight rebuilt ATBs at September 30, 2016. In addition, given the uncertainty around how long the weak market conditions discussed above could last taking into consideration the large number of newbuildings scheduled for delivery, management believed that it was more likely than not that some of the rebuilt ATBs would be laid-up, scrapped or disposed of before the end of their estimated useful lives, which currently range between 2019 and 2020.The indicators discussed above were not considered to be impairment triggering events for the other ATBs and tankers in the Company's fleet as these vessels (i) were fairly recently built and do not face the same commercial obsolescence issues faced by the rebuilt ATBs, and (ii) are currently operating under long-term charters or contracts of affreightment.\nIn developing estimates of undiscounted future cash flows for performing Step 1 of the impairment tests, management made assumptions about future performance, with significant assumptions being related to charter rates, ship operating expenses, utilization, drydocking requirements, residual value and the estimated remaining useful lives of the vessels. The assumptions about the estimated remaining useful lives of the ATBs reflects management's current belief that the Company would scrap these ATBs at the expiry of their current time charters. Based on tests performed, the sum of the undiscounted cash flows for seven of the eight rebuilt ATBs were less than their September 30, 2016 carrying values. Accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $97,782 (including $3,873 recorded as a reduction in deferred drydock costs) to write down the carrying values of the seven ATBs to their estimated fair values as of September 30, 2016.\nIn addition, during the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company decided to delay the disposal of one of its rebuilt ATBs from the estimated disposal date utilized in the September 30, 2016 impairment testing. This decision resulted in a change in the expected deployment of a second rebuilt ATB, which had been projected to assume the first ATB's time charter on January 1, 2017, and a decline in its forecasted cash flows. Accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $6,623 at December 31, 2016.\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, in evaluating whether or not certain events or circumstances existing at that time resulted in a triggering event for impairment testing of the U.S. Flag fleet, management gave consideration to various indicators of a weakening of the Jones Act crude oil transportation market that began to materialize during the period. Such indicators included a decline in U.S crude oil production beginning in May 2015 following a decrease in oil prices beginning in late 2014, which quickly led to steep cuts in drilling activity. The resulting decrease in demand for the coastwise transportation of crude oil led to a decline in average daily spot rates for Jones Act tankers during the nine-month period ending September 30, 2015 and the redeployment of several Jones Act vessels, including some of the Company's vessels, from the crude oil transportation trade to the clean oil transportation trade. In addition, the decline in U.S. crude oil production coupled with the large orderbook for Jones Act vessels scheduled for delivery through late 2017 increased uncertainty around the likelihood of being able to renew or extend the time charters on the Company's fleet of eight rebuilt Jones Act ATBs, of which two expired during 2016 and four are scheduled to expire in the second quarter of 2017. Management believed that if the weakness identified in the market continued for a prolonged period of time, it would become increasingly difficult for the Company's older ATBs to find employment at attractive rates that justify the expenditure required to put these vessels through their next drydock special surveys.\nManagement concluded that the above indicators constituted impairment triggering events for six of the eight vessels in the Company's fleet of rebuilt ATBs at September 30, 2015. In addition, given the uncertainty around how long the weak market conditions discussed above could last, management determined that it was more likely than not that the rebuilt ATBs will be scrapped before the end of their estimated useful lives, which ranged from 2021 to 2028 (see discussion above under -Vessel Lives and Salvage Values\u201d). The indicators discussed above were not considered to be impairment triggering events for the other U.S. Flag ATBs employed in lightering and currently operating under long-term charters or contracts of affreightment agreements.\nManagement prepared undiscounted cash flows models, which utilized weighted probabilities assigned to possible outcomes for the six rebuilt ATBs. A significant probability was assigned to the possibility that the estimated remaining useful life of each ATB would end at its next drydock special survey date, as management believed it was more likely than not that the Company would scrap these vessels rather than make the significant capital expenditure necessary to comply with regulatory requirements. Based on tests performed, the sum of the undiscounted cash flows for each of the six rebuilt ATBs was in excess of its September 30, 2015 carrying value and no impairment was therefore recorded at that date. As of December 31, 2015, management determined that there had been no significant changes in the facts and circumstances that existed at the end of September 30, 2015 that would warrant a change to the assumptions utilized in the undiscounted cash flows analysis on the six rebuilt ATBs prepared at that date. Accordingly, no further analysis was performed as of December 31, 2015.\nIntangible Asset\nThe Company allocates the cost of acquired companies to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired, with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill. The Company's sole intangible asset represent long-term customer relationships acquired as part of the 2006 purchase of Maritrans, Inc. The events noted above under Vessel Impairment during the third quarter of 2016 also triggered an interim impairment test on its customer relationship intangible asset. The business as a whole was determined to be the lowest level at which cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities for purposes of testing the customer relationship intangible asset for recoverability. Based on the results of the recoverability test performed, no intangible assets impairment was recorded as of September 30, 2016 as the net undiscounted cash flows from the asset group were significantly in excess of the carrying value of the asset group. The Company also determined that there were no triggering events between September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016.\nTable 258: <table><tr><td>50 </td> <td>Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 259: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDrydocking\nWithin the shipping industry, there are two methods that are used to account for dry dockings: (1) capitalize drydocking costs as incurred (deferral method) and amortize such costs over the period to the next scheduled drydocking, and (2) expense drydocking costs as incurred. Since drydocking cycles typically extend over two and a half years or five years, management uses the deferral method because management believes it provides a better matching of revenues and expenses than the expense-as-incurred method.\nIncome Taxes, Deferred Tax Assets and Valuation Allowance\nOur income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes primarily in the U.S. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense.\nDeferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and from events that have been recognized in the financial statements and will result in taxable or deductible amounts based on provisions of the tax law in different periods. In evaluating our ability to recover our net deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. A valuation allowance is established to the extent it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future.\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations across our global operations. ASC 740 provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, on the basis of the technical merits of the position. ASC 740 also provides guidance on measurement, derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. We recognize tax liabilities and reductions in deferred tax assets in accordance with ASC 740 and we adjust these liabilities and deferred tax assets when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available.\nPension Benefits\nIn connection with the acquisition of Maritrans in November 2006, the Company assumed the obligations under the noncontributory defined benefit pension plan that covered eligible employees of Maritrans ( the Maritrans Plan\u201d). The Company froze the benefits payable under the Maritrans Plan as of December 31, 2006. The Company has recorded pension benefit costs based on complex valuations developed by its actuarial consultants. These valuations are based on estimates and key assumptions, including those related to the discount rates, the rates expected to be earned on investments of plan assets and the life expectancy/mortality of plan participants. OSG is required to consider market conditions in selecting a discount rate that is representative of the rates of return currently available on high-quality fixed income investments. A higher discount rate would result in a lower benefit obligation and a lower rate would result in a higher benefit obligation. The expected rate of return on plan assets is management's best estimate of expected returns on plan assets. A decrease in the expected rate of return will increase net periodic benefit costs and an increase in the expected rate of return will decrease benefit costs. The mortality assumption is management's best estimate of the expected duration of future benefit payments at the measurement date. The estimate is based on the specific demographics and other relevant facts and circumstances of the Maritrans Plan and considers all relevant information available at the measurement date. Longer life expectancies would result in higher benefit obligations and a decrease in life expectancies would result in lower benefit obligations.\nIn determining the benefit obligations at the end of the year measurement date, the Company continues to use the equivalent single weighted-average discount rate, rounded to the nearest 5 basis points, that best matches projected benefit payments. During 2016, the Company changed its actuarial service provider and, therefore, for December 31, 2016, the Company based the discount rate on such actuary's proprietary index, which was calculated based on a universe of approximately 500 Aa-graded non-callable bonds. This rate was 3.95% as of December 31, 2016. For at least the two prior years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Company used the Citigroup Above Median Pension Discount Curve applied to the future payouts under the Maritrans Plan. The rates were 4.00% and 3.75% at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Although the December 31, 2016 index was different from that used in prior years, management believes that the current results are consistent with those that would have been produced had the Company continued to use the Citigroup Above Median Pension Discount Curve as it did in 2015 and 2014. The Company also assumed a long-term rate of return on the Maritrans Plan assets of 7.25% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, based on the asset mix as of such dates and management's estimate of the long term rate of return that could be achieved over the remaining duration of the Maritrans Plan. Based on the current asset mix, management believes the probability of achieving a long-term return of 7.25% over the remaining duration of the Maritrans Plan is more likely than not.\nTable 260: <table><tr><td>51 </td> <td>Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 261: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn late 2014, the Society of Actuaries ( RPEC\u201d) published a new set of mortality tables (RP-2014) and a related, mortality improvement scale (MP-2014). The Company's policy is to utilize the latest published mortality tables and improvement scales, without adjustment to determine the year-end benefit obligation. The set of mortality tables used in determining the net benefit cost for 2016 as well as the December 31, 2015 end of year measurement is the RP-2016 mortality tables, with separate rates for male non-annuitants and annuitants and for female non-annuitants and annuitants. Gender-distinct generational mortality improvements under Scale MP-2015 were included. For the 2016 end of year measurement of the benefit obligations, the RP-2014 mortality tables with generational mortality improvements under Scale MP-2016 were used. Management believes the use of the unadjusted tables is appropriate given the diversity of the participants of the Maritrans Plan, which include both inter-waterway tug officers and office employees.\nThe duration of the benefit obligation at each of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was 11.26 years and 11.71 years, respectively.\nCritical Accounting Policies of the Company's Discontinued Operations\nWe believe the following discussion provides useful additional information with respect to the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements with respect to the assets and liabilities and results of operations of INSW, which are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nRevenue Recognition\nINSW generates a majority of its revenue from voyage charters, including vessels in pools that predominantly perform voyage charters, and recognizes revenue ratably over the estimated length of each voyage using the discharge-to-discharge basis.\nFor the INSW vessels operating in Commercial Pools, revenues and voyage expenses are pooled and allocated to each pool's participants on a time charter equivalent basis in accordance with an agreed-upon formula. The formulas in the pool agreements for allocating gross shipping revenues net of voyage expenses are based on points allocated to participants' vessels based on cargo carrying capacity and other technical characteristics, such as speed and fuel consumption. The selection of charterers, negotiation of rates and collection of related receivables and the payment of voyage expenses are the responsibility of the pools. The pools may enter into contracts that earn either voyage charter revenue or time charter revenue. Each of the pools follows the same revenue recognition principles, as applied by the Company, in determining shipping revenues and voyage expenses, including recognizing revenue only after a charter has been agreed to by both the pool and the customer, even if the vessel has discharged its cargo and is sailing to the anticipated load port on its next voyage.\nFor the pools in which INSW participates, Company management monitored, among other things, the relative proportion of INSW's vessels operating in each of the pools to the total number of vessels in each of the respective pools, and assesses whether or not INSW's participation interest in each of the pools is sufficiently significant so as to determine that INSW has effective control of the pool. Company management determined that as of June 30, 2013, it had effective control of one of the pools in which INSW participated. Such pool was not a legal entity but operated under a contractual agreement. Therefore, effective July 1, 2013 through June 30, 2014, when INSW's participation in this pool ended, INSW's allocated TCE revenues for such pool were reported on a gross basis as voyage charter revenues and voyage expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. The impact of this method of presenting earnings for this pool was an increase in both voyage charter revenues and voyage expenses of $40,454 for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nVessel Lives and Salvage Values\nThe carrying value of each of INSW's vessels represented its original cost at the time it was delivered or purchased less depreciation calculated using an estimated useful life of 25 years (except for FSO service vessels for which estimated useful lives of 30 years are used and LNG Carriers for which estimated useful lives of 35 years are used) from the date such vessel was originally delivered from the shipyard. A vessel's carrying value is reduced to its new cost basis (i.e. its current fair value) if a vessel impairment charge is recorded.\nCompany management estimated the scrap value of INSW's vessels to be $300 per lightweight ton. The assumptions used in the determination of estimated salvage value took into account current scrap prices, the historic pattern of annual average scrap rates over the four year and eleven-month period ended November 30, 2016, which ranged from $280 to $480 per lightweight ton, estimated changes in future market demand for scrap steel and estimated future demand for vessels. Scrap prices also fluctuate depending upon type of ship, bunkers on board, spares on board and delivery range.\nTable 262: <table><tr><td>52 </td> <td>Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 263: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAlthough management believes that the assumptions used to determine the scrap rate for its International Flag vessels are reasonable and appropriate, such assumptions are highly subjective, in part, because of the cyclicality of the nature of future demand for scrap steel.\nVessel and Investment in Joint Venture Impairments - Held for Sale Basis (Disposal Group)\nAs discussed in Note 5, Discontinued Operations,\u201d to the Company's consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d ASC 845 requires that the accounting for the distribution of nonmonetary assets to owners of an entity in a spinoff be based on the historical recorded amount, after reduction, if appropriate, for an indicated impairment of value, calculated on a held for sale basis.\nThe determination of fair value is highly judgmental. In estimating the fair value of INSW's vessels as of November 30, 2016 the Company considered the market and income approaches by using a combination of third party appraisals and discounted cash flow models prepared by the Company. In preparing the discounted cash flow models, the Company used a methodology consistent with the methodology and assumptions detailed in the Vessel Impairment - Held for Use Basis\u201d section below, and discounted the cash flows using its current estimate of INSW's weighted average cost of capital, of 9%.\nIn estimating the fair value of INSW's investments in and advances to affiliated companies as of November 30, 2016, the Company utilized an income approach since there is a lack of comparable market transactions for the specially built assets held by the joint ventures, by preparing discounted cash flow models. In preparing the discounted cash flows models the Company used a methodology largely consistent with the methodology and assumptions detailed in the Vessel Impairment - Held for Use Basis\u201d section below, with the exception being that as the assets owned by the joint ventures serve under specific service contracts, the estimated charter rates for periods after the expiry of the existing contracts are based upon management's internally forecasted rates. The cash flows were discounted using the current estimated weighted average cost of capital for each joint venture, which ranged from 8.7% to 9.5% and took into consideration country risk, entity size and uncertainty with respect to the cash flows for periods beyond the current charter expires.\nAccordingly, management recorded a charge in the fourth quarter of 2016, as part of income/(loss) from discontinued operations of $332,562 to reduce the carrying value of the disposal group to its estimated fair value, calculated on a held for sale basis. Management believes that it has identified and evaluated all long-lived assets within the disposal group for impairment in accordance with the guidance in ASC 845. Management also took into account the market capitalization of INSW following the spin on November 30, 2016 to assess and conclude on the reasonableness of the impairment charge related to the INSW disposal group, and considered the following factors: (i) INSW was a new public entity with little analyst coverage until January 2017; (ii) currently there is a lower level of liquidity for the INSW common stock since six shareholders hold approximately 60% of INSW's shares; (iii) the stock price as of February 27, 2017 was more than 25% higher than the closing price on the date of the spin off transaction; (iv) the shipping industry is highly cyclical and in periods of negative market sentiment, such as existed at the time of the spin off transaction and that currently persists, it is common for companies to trade at discounts to NAV.\nVessel Impairment - Held for Use Basis\nIn developing estimates of future cash flows for the INSW vessels, the Company must make assumptions about future performance, with significant assumptions being related to charter rates, ship operating expenses, utilization, drydocking requirements, residual value and the estimated remaining useful lives of the vessels. These assumptions are based on historical trends as well as future expectations. Specifically, in estimating future charter rates, management takes into consideration rates currently in effect for existing time charters and estimated daily time charter equivalent rates for each vessel class for the unfixed days over the estimated remaining lives of each of the vessels. The estimated daily time charter equivalent rates used for unfixed days are based on a combination of (i) internally forecasted rates that are consistent with forecasts provided to the Company's senior management and Board of Directors, and (ii) the trailing 12-year historical average rates, based on quarterly average rates published by a third party maritime research service. The internally forecasted rates are based on management's evaluation of current economic data and trends in the shipping and oil and gas industries. Management used the published 12-year historical average rates in its assumptions because it is management's belief that the 12-year period captures an even distribution of strong and weak charter rate periods, which results in the use of an average mid-cycle rate that is more in line with management's forecast of a return to mid-cycle charter rate levels in the medium term. Recognizing that the transportation of crude oil and petroleum products is cyclical and subject to significant volatility based on factors beyond the Company's control, management believes the use of estimates based on the combination of internally forecasted rates and 12-year historical average rates calculated as of the reporting date to be reasonable.\nIn estimating the fair value of vessels for the purposes of step 2 of the impairment tests, the Company utilizes a market approach by using third party appraisals for the vessels in the INSW fleet.\nTable 264: <table><tr><td>53 </td> <td>Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 265: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe more significant factors that could impact management's assumptions regarding time charter equivalent rates include (i) loss or reduction in business from significant customers, (ii) unanticipated changes in demand for transportation of crude oil and petroleum products, (iii) changes in production of or demand for oil and petroleum products, generally or in particular regions, (iv) greater than anticipated levels of tanker newbuilding orders or lower than anticipated levels of tanker scrappings, and (v) changes in rules and regulations applicable to the tanker industry, including legislation adopted by international organizations such as IMO and the EU or by individual countries. Although management believes that the assumptions used to evaluate potential impairment are reasonable and appropriate at the time they were made, such assumptions are highly subjective.\nInternational Flag Fleet Impairment Evaluations\nSeptember 30, 2016 Impairment evaluation - Management concluded that declines in third party vessel valuations of up to 20% during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 for 28 vessels in INSW's fleet with carrying values in excess of their estimated market values, constituted an impairment trigger event for these vessels as of September 30, 2016. Based upon the impairment tests performed impairment charges totaling $49,640 were recorded on two LR1s, an Aframax and a Panamax to write-down their carrying values to their estimated fair values at September 30, 2016. The remaining 24 vessels tested had estimated undiscounted future cash flows in excess of their carrying values.\nDecember 31, 2015 Impairment evaluation - Management gave consideration as to whether any events and changes in circumstances existed as of December 31, 2015 that could be viewed as indicators that the carrying amounts of the vessels in the Company's International Flag fleet were not recoverable as of December 31, 2015 and determined there were no such events or changes in circumstances.\nDecember 31, 2014 Impairment evaluation - Management gave consideration to the following events and changes in circumstances in determining whether there were any indicators that the carrying amounts of the vessels in INSW's fleet were not recoverable as of December 31, 2014:\nTable 266: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>i. </td> <td>A significant year-over-year decline in third party valuation appraisals of four MRs securing the INSW term loan; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 267: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>ii. </td> <td>the impact, if any, of management's intent to dispose of or continue to trade certain vessels during 2015; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 268: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>iii. </td> <td>the impact, if any, of outsourcing technical and commercial management of the INSW conventional tanker fleet. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement determined that the latter two factors had no impact on the carrying value INSW's fleet as of December 31, 2014. However, the decline in the third party valuation appraisals on four modern MRs, which were built between 2009 and 2011, was deemed to be an impairment indicator requiring the need to test the recoverability of the carrying value of these vessels. Based on tests performed, it was determined that the vessels would generate undiscounted cash flows in excess of their December 31, 2014 carrying values over the remainder of their useful lives.\nNewly Issued Accounting Standards\nSee Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to the Company's consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d", "item_7_truncated": "In estimating the fair value of INSW's investments in and advances to affiliated companies as of November 30, 2016, the Company utilized an income approach since there is a lack of comparable market transactions for the specially built assets held by the joint ventures, by preparing discounted cash flow models.

The assumptions about the estimated remaining useful lives of the ATBs reflects management's current belief that the Company would scrap these ATBs at the expiry of their current time charters. Based on tests performed, the sum of the undiscounted cash flows for seven of the eight rebuilt ATBs were less than their September 30, 2016 carrying values. Accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $97,782 (including $3,873 recorded as a reduction in deferred drydock costs) to write down the carrying values of the seven ATBs to their estimated fair values as of September 30, 2016.\nSeptember 30, 2016 Impairment evaluation - Management concluded that declines in third party vessel valuations of up to 20% during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 for 28 vessels in INSW's fleet with carrying values in excess of their estimated market values, constituted an impairment trigger event for these vessels as of September 30, 2016.

Depreciation expense increased by $12,826 to $89,257 in 2016 from $76,431 in 2015 primarily as a result of the shortening of the useful lives of six of the Company's Jones Act ATBs effective October 1, 2015 and a further shortening of the useful lives of seven of the Jones Act ATBs effective October 1, 2016, as discussed further in Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nTable 222: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>TCE revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>446,160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>449,058 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>414,373 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Vessel expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(140,696 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(138,179 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(135,079 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Charter hire expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(91,947 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(91,875 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(91,061 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(89,257 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(76,431 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(66,584 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income from vessel operations (a) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>124,260 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>142,573 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>121,649 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Average daily TCE rate </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51,540 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,035 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,231 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Average number of owned vessels </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Average number of vessels chartered-in under operating leases </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Number of revenue days (b) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,657 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,311 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,417 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Number of ship-operating days: (c) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Owned vessels </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,124 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,110 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,110 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Vessels bareboat chartered-in under operating leases </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,660 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,653 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,650 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Vessels time chartered-in under operating leases </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nVessel Impairment - Held for Use Basis\nTable 226: <table> <tr> <td>For the year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Time charter equivalent revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>446,160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>449,058 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>414,373 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Add: Voyage expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,260 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,814 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,044 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Shipping revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>462,420 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>466,872 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>440,417 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n \nINTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY\nWithin the shipping industry, there are two methods that are used to account for dry dockings: (1) capitalize drydocking costs as incurred (deferral method) and amortize such costs over the period to the next scheduled drydocking, and (2) expense drydocking costs as incurred. Since drydocking cycles typically extend over two and a half years or five years, management uses the deferral method because management believes it provides a better matching of revenues and expenses than the expense-as-incurred method.\nTable 247: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

tax rate decreased compared with the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of the absence of the tax benefit attributable to the Pre-Filing Agreement with the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d) in 2015, offset in part by the reversal of the deferred tax liability associated with the Company's investment in INSW.\n \n 39 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. \nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, in evaluating whether or not certain events or circumstances existing at that time resulted in a triggering event for impairment testing of the U.S. Flag fleet, management gave consideration to various indicators of a weakening of the Jones Act crude oil transportation market that began to materialize during the period. Such indicators included a decline in U.S crude oil production beginning in May 2015 following a decrease in oil prices beginning in late 2014, which quickly led to steep cuts in drilling activity. The resulting decrease in demand for the coastwise transportation of crude oil led to a decline in average daily spot rates for Jones Act tankers during the nine-month period ending September 30, 2015 and the redeployment of several Jones Act vessels, including some of the Company's vessels, from the crude oil transportation trade to the clean oil transportation trade. In addition, the decline in U.S. crude oil production coupled with the large orderbook for Jones Act vessels scheduled for delivery through late 2017 increased uncertainty around the likelihood of being able to renew or extend the time charters on the Company's fleet of eight rebuilt Jones Act ATBs, of which two expired during 2016 and four are scheduled to expire in the second quarter of 2017. Management believed that if the weakness identified in the market continued for a prolonged period of time, it would become increasingly difficult for the Company's older ATBs to find employment at attractive rates that justify the expenditure required to put these vessels through their next drydock special surveys.\n 50 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. \n 47 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. \nWhile EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by companies as a measure of operating results and performance, neither of those items as prepared by the Company is necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to differences in methods of calculation.\nThe spin-off transaction was in the form of a pro rata distribution of INSW common stock to OSG's stockholders and warrant holders of record as of the close of business on November 18, 2016 (the Record Date.\u201d) On the Distribution Date, each holder of OSG common stock received 0.3333 shares of INSW common stock for every share of OSG common stock held on the Record Date. Each holder of OSG warrants received 0.3333 shares of INSW common stock for every one share of OSG common stock they would have received if they exercised their warrants immediately prior to the Distribution (or 0.063327 INSW shares per warrant).\nEBITDA represents net (loss)/income from continuing operations before interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA consists of EBITDA adjusted for the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented to provide investors with meaningful additional information that management uses to monitor ongoing operating results and evaluate trends over comparative periods. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent, and should not be considered a substitute for, net income or cash flows from operations determined in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations are:\nINCOME TAX BENEFIT FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS\nVessel and Investment in Joint Venture Impairments - Held for Sale Basis (Disposal Group)\nTwo reflagged U.S. Flag Product Carriers participate in the U.S. Maritime Security Program, which ensures that privately-owned, military-useful U.S. Flag vessels are available to the U.S. Department of Defense in the event of war or national emergency. Each of the vessel-owning companies receives an annual subsidy, subject in each case to annual congressional appropriations, which is intended to offset the increased cost incurred by such vessels from operating under the U.S. Flag. In December 2015, the annual subsidy was increased and the Company expects to receive $5.0 million from 2017 through 2020, and $5.2 million beginning in 2021. As of December 31, 2016 funds had not been appropriated for the fiscal year 2017 vessel subsidy of $5.0 million. The Company does not receive the subsidy with respect to any days for which one or both of the vessels operate under a time charter to a U.S. government agency, which was the case for one vessel during the third quarter of 2016.\nVessel expenses increased by $3,100 to $138,179 in 2015 from $135,079 in 2014, primarily due to an increase in average daily vessel expenses of $654 per day, which resulted principally from higher crew costs. Depreciation expense increased by $9,847 to $76,431 in 2015 from $66,584 in 2014. Such increase reflects (i) the depreciation of costs incurred in 2014 to convert the conventional Jones Act Product Carrier referred to above into a shuttle tanker, (ii) the impact on amortization of drydock costs incurred during 2015, which were approximately $16,000 higher than drydock costs incurred during 2014 as more vessels were drydocked in 2015 and (iii) the reduction in useful lives of the Company's rebuilt Jones Act ATBs.\nOur business is capital intensive. Our ability to successfully implement our strategy is dependent on the continued availability of capital on attractive terms. In addition, our ability to successfully operate our business to meet near-term and long-term debt repayment obligations is dependent on maintaining sufficient liquidity.\nCritical Accounting Policies of the Company's Discontinued Operations\n 41 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. \nIn late 2014, the Society of Actuaries ( RPEC\u201d) published a new set of mortality tables (RP-2014) and a related, mortality improvement scale (MP-2014). The Company's policy is to utilize the latest published mortality tables and improvement scales, without adjustment to determine the year-end benefit obligation. The set of mortality tables used in determining the net benefit cost for 2016 as well as the December 31, 2015 end of year measurement is the RP-2016 mortality tables, with separate rates for male non-annuitants and annuitants and for female non-annuitants and annuitants. Gender-distinct generational mortality improvements under Scale MP-2015 were included. For the 2016 end of year measurement of the benefit obligations, the RP-2014 mortality tables with generational mortality improvements under Scale MP-2016 were used. Management believes the use of the unadjusted tables is appropriate given the diversity of the participants of the Maritrans Plan, which include both inter-waterway tug officers and office employees.\nWe are a leading provider of energy transportation services, delivering crude oil and petroleum products. We own and operate a combined fleet of 24 vessels registered in the United States. Our well maintained fleet and commitment to high quality, incident-free service positions us as a preferred service provider of major oil companies and refiners.\nOPERATIONS AND OIL TANKER MARKETS\nDuring 2016, TCE revenues decreased by $2,898, or 1%, to $446,160 from $449,058 in 2015. A weakening Jones Act crude oil transportation market during the current year resulted in a decline in average daily rates earned by the Company's Jones Act ATBs and Jones Act Product Carriers, as well as increased spot market exposure, which accounted for a $16,204 decrease in revenue. The spot rates in the above table for Jones Act Product Carriers reflect idle days awaiting cargoes for one of the vessels that redelivered from a long-term charter in mid-June 2016. Offsetting this decrease to a large degree was (i) a 266-day increase in Jones Act ATB, Jones Act Product Carrier and Non-Jones Act Product Carrier revenue days, which accounted for a $11,175 increase in revenue, (ii) a $1,219 increase in Delaware Bay lightering revenue, and (iii) increased average daily rates for the Company's Non-Jones Act Product Carriers which accounted for a $911 increase in revenue. The increase in revenue days was principally attributable to a reduction in drydock and repair days in the current year. The increase in revenue earned by the Delaware Bay lightering vessels was primarily due to an increase in Delaware Bay lightering volumes and an 81-day decrease in drydock and repair days in the current year, partially offset by certain coastwise voyage opportunities that were available in the first half of 2015, but not in 2016.\nOur business operates as a single reportable segment. We believe that this is appropriate as our chief decision maker and our management team make decisions about resource allocations and review and measure our results as one line of business with similar regulatory requirements, customers and commodities transported. Our fleet includes tankers and ATBs, of which 22 operate under the Jones Act and two operate internationally and participate in the MSP. We own ten ATBs, which consist of eight vessels that transport primarily petroleum products and two that perform lightering operations in the Delaware Bay. We operate fourteen tankers, ten that have been chartered-in under operating leases and four that we own, including the two that participate in the MSP. Revenues are derived predominantly from time charter agreements, which provide a more predictable level of revenues. We derived approximately 17% of our total TCE revenues in the spot market for 2016.\n i. A significant year-over-year decline in third party valuation appraisals of four MRs securing the INSW term loan; \nOutlook\nDuring 2015, TCE revenues increased by $34,685, or 8%, to $449,058 from $414,373 in 2014. Growth in the average daily rates earned by the Company's Jones Act Product Carriers and Jones Act ATBs accounted for $33,689 of such increase. This increase reflected the strength of the Jones Act market in 2015, which allowed the Jones Act Product Carriers and ATBs to generally achieve higher rates on new or extended time charters upon the expiry of existing time charters through the first half of 2015. Contributing to an increase in TCE revenues in the second half of 2015 was the June 2015 commencement of a ten-year time charter out entered into by one of the Company's Jones Act Product Carriers that had been converted into a shuttle tanker.\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require the Company to make estimates in the application of its accounting policies based on the best assumptions, judgments, and opinions of management. Following is a discussion of the accounting policies that involve a higher degree of judgment and the methods of their application. For a description of all of the Company's material accounting policies, see Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the Company's consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\n (a) Income from vessel operations is before general and administrative expenses, depreciation on non-vessel related fixed assets, technical management transition costs, severance costs, and gain/(loss) on disposal of vessels, including impairments. \nEstimated TCE rates for prompt Jones Act Product Carriers and large ATBs decreased during the year ended December 31, 2016 from 2015 for each class of vessel. The decrease in 2016 compared with 2015 can be attributed to market uncertainty created by the decline in oil prices, the degree to which sustained low prices might cause U.S. crude oil production to decline further, and the increase in vessel supply.\nIn January 2015, the Company requested that the IRS review under its Pre-Filing Agreement Program the deductibility of certain payments made by OSG in 2014, in the aggregate amount of $477,835, in its capacity as guarantor of the obligations of subsidiaries of INSW under certain loan agreements. In connection with these payments, the Company had established an unrecognized tax benefit equal to the full amount of such benefits, or $179,151 as of December 31, 2014. On September 4, 2015, the Company received an executed closing agreement from the IRS, which allowed a deduction of $424,523. As a result of the closing agreement, the Company reduced its reserve for uncertain tax positions by $179,151, recognized an income tax benefit of $150,073 and reduced its deferred tax asset for net operating loss carryforwards by $29,078 during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nGENERAL\n (2) Amounts are estimated based on the 2016 cost taking the assumed health care cost trend rate for 2017 to 2021 into consideration. See Note 17, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans,\u201d to the Company's consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8,\u201d Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d Because of the subjective nature of the assumptions made, actual premiums paid in future years may differ significantly from the estimated amounts. \nNewly Issued Accounting Standards\nThe effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were 98.4%, 493.7% and 44.8%, respectively. The Company's effective tax rates are affected by recurring items, such as permanent differences (and their relative amount versus income) and discrete items that may occur in one year but are not consistent from year to year.\nAs of December 31, 2016, as a result of the spin-off of INSW, the Company reversed its deferred tax liability in the amount of $48,856 recognized on the basis difference in its investment in INSW as the Spin-off resulted in a non-deductible taxable loss on the Company's investment in INSW.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the industry's entire Jones Act fleet of Product Carriers and large ATBs (defined as vessels having carrying capacities of between 140,000 barrels and 350,000 barrels, which excludes numerous tank barges below 140,000-barrel capacity and 11 much larger tankers dedicated exclusively to the Alaskan crude oil trade) consisted of 90 vessels, compared with 79 vessels as of December 31, 2015. There were 12 deliveries and two vessels scrapped during 2016. The deliveries included eight Product Tankers and four ATBs. The scrapped vessels were two tankers, one of which was a late 1970s-built Alaskan crude tanker redeployed into the lower-48 coastwise trade during 2015, which was not part of the 79 vessel count noted above. In addition to the 90 vessels mentioned above, one late-1970s-built Alaskan crude tanker was sold by Exxon to competitors and redeployed into the lower-48 coastwise trade during 2015.\n\n\nDelaware Bay lightering volumes averaged 172,000 b/d in 2016 compared with 105,000 b/d in 2015. The increase resulted from imported crude oil becoming more economically attractive to Delaware Bay refiners compared with the cost of transporting domestically produced shale oil on vessels that do not require lightering services.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our effective tax rate increased by approximately 449% compared with the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily as a result of the Pre-Filing Agreement with the IRS offset in part by the deferred tax liability recognized on the Company's investment in INSW.\nAlthough management believes that the assumptions used to determine the scrap rate for its International Flag vessels are reasonable and appropriate, such assumptions are highly subjective, in part, because of the cyclicality of the nature of future demand for scrap steel.\n\nINSW generates a majority of its revenue from voyage charters, including vessels in pools that predominantly perform voyage charters, and recognizes revenue ratably over the estimated length of each voyage using the discharge-to-discharge basis.\nDuring 2016, we repurchased and retired $294 of our outstanding 2024 Notes and $37,345 of our 2018 Notes. Also, during 2016, OBS opportunistically repurchased and retired $27,000 of the outstanding principal under the OBS Term Loan at a discounted price of $23,584. During the year ended December 31, 2016, OBS also made optional and mandatory principal prepayments of $59,000 and $51,295, respectively.\nIf the estimated economic lives assigned to the Company's vessels prove to be too long because of new regulations, an extended period of weak markets, the broad imposition of age restrictions by the Company's customers, or other future events, it could result in higher depreciation expense and impairment losses in future periods related to a reduction in the useful lives of any affected vessels. In evaluating various impairment indicators that existed at September 30, 2015 (as discussed below under Vessel Impairment) management believed at that time that it was more likely than not that the Company would scrap six of its rebuilt ATBs at the time of their next scheduled drydock special survey date rather than make the significant capital expenditures necessary to comply with regulatory requirements. Accordingly, the remaining useful lives for such ATBs were adjusted on a prospective basis beginning on October 1, 2015. This reduction in useful lives increased depreciation expense on these vessels by approximately $3,600 per quarter. During the third quarter of 2016, management evaluated various impairment indicators that existed at the end of such period and as a result, determined that it was more likely than not that the Company would scrap seven of its rebuilt ATBs prior to their then estimated disposal date as described above. Accordingly, the remaining useful lives for such ATBs were further adjusted. This reduction in useful lives negatively impacted depreciation expense attributable to the ATB vessel impairments discussed in Note 6, Vessels, Deferred Drydock and Other Property,\u201d by approximately $2,200 per quarter beginning on October 1, 2016.\nOur income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes primarily in the U.S. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense.\nLIQUIDITY AND SOURCES OF CAPITAL\nThe determination of fair value is highly judgmental. In estimating the fair value of INSW's vessels as of November 30, 2016 the Company considered the market and income approaches by using a combination of third party appraisals and discounted cash flow models prepared by the Company. In preparing the discounted cash flow models, the Company used a methodology consistent with the methodology and assumptions detailed in the Vessel Impairment - Held for Use Basis\u201d section below, and discounted the cash flows using its current estimate of INSW's weighted average cost of capital, of 9%.\n iii. the impact, if any, of outsourcing technical and commercial management of the INSW conventional tanker fleet. \nThe Company considered changes in circumstances that appeared to be indicative of a continued weakening of the Jones Act crude oil transportation market during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. Such indicators included a decline in the number of Jones Act tank vessels transporting crude oil, which led to (i) increased competition for clean cargoes and the idling of some Jones Act vessels; (ii) a sharp decrease in estimated spot rates for Jones Act Product Carriers and large ATBs between July and September 2016; and (iii) a significant decline in forecasted near term TCE rates reported by a leading third party industry analyst. These factors were viewed as an impairment trigger event for the Company's eight rebuilt ATBs at September 30, 2016. In addition, given the uncertainty around how long the weak market conditions discussed above could last taking into consideration the large number of newbuildings scheduled for delivery, management believed that it was more likely than not that some of the rebuilt ATBs would be laid-up, scrapped or disposed of before the end of their estimated useful lives, which currently range between 2019 and 2020.The indicators discussed above were not considered to be impairment triggering events for the other ATBs and tankers in the Company's fleet as these vessels (i) were fairly recently built and do not face the same commercial obsolescence issues faced by the rebuilt ATBs, and (ii) are currently operating under long-term charters or contracts of affreightment.\n 49 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. \nThe decrease in depreciation and amortization in 2015 compared with 2014 was primarily due to the vessel sales noted above. This decrease was partially offset by the impact of the LR2 newbuild delivery referred to above.\nThe carrying value of each of INSW's vessels represented its original cost at the time it was delivered or purchased less depreciation calculated using an estimated useful life of 25 years (except for FSO service vessels for which estimated useful lives of 30 years are used and LNG Carriers for which estimated useful lives of 35 years are used) from the date such vessel was originally delivered from the shipyard. A vessel's carrying value is reduced to its new cost basis (i.e. its current fair value) if a vessel impairment charge is recorded.\nVessel Lives and Salvage Values\nIncome Taxes, Deferred Tax Assets and Valuation Allowance\nRevenue Recognition\nIn developing estimates of future cash flows, the Company must make assumptions about future performance, with significant assumptions being related to charter rates, ship operating expenses, utilization, drydocking requirements, residual value and the estimated remaining useful lives of the vessels. These assumptions are based on historical trends as well as future expectations. Specifically, in estimating future charter rates, management takes into consideration rates currently in effect for existing time charters and estimated daily time charter equivalent rates for each vessel class for the unfixed days over the estimated remaining lives of each of the vessels. The estimated daily time charter equivalent rates used for unfixed days beyond the expiry of any current time charters are based on internally forecasted rates that take into consideration average annual rates published by a third party maritime research service and are consistent with forecasts provided to the Company's senior management and Board of Directors. The internally forecasted rates are based on management's evaluation of current economic data and trends in the shipping and oil and gas industries. Recognizing that the transportation of crude oil and petroleum products is cyclical and subject to significant volatility based on factors beyond the Company's control, management believes the use of estimates based on the internally forecasted rates to be reasonable.\nPrincipal (Notional) Amount (dollars in millions) by Expected Maturity and Average Interest (Swap) Rate\nAt December 31, 2016, OBS was party to an interest rate cap agreement ( Interest Rate Cap\u201d) with a date of February 15, 2015 with major financial institutions covering the notional amount of $375,000, to limit the floating interest rate exposure associated with its term loan. This agreement contains no leverage features. The OBS Interest Rate Cap has a cap rate of 2.5% through February 5, 2017, at which time the cap rate increases to 3.0% through the termination date of February 5, 2018.\n(1)\tAmounts shown include contractual interest obligations. Interest obligations on fixed rate debt of $82,310 as of December 31, 2016 range from 7.5% to 8.125%. The interest rate obligations of floating rate debt have been estimated based on the aggregate of the LIBOR floor rate of 1% and the applicable margin for the OBS Term Loan of 4.25%. Management believes that no prepayment in 2017 is required for the OBS Term Loan as a result of Excess Cash Flow for the twelve- month period ended December 31, 2016. Amounts shown for the OBS Term Loan for years subsequent to 2017 exclude any estimated repayment as a result of Excess Cash Flow.\t\nManagement prepared undiscounted cash flows models, which utilized weighted probabilities assigned to possible outcomes for the six rebuilt ATBs. A significant probability was assigned to the possibility that the estimated remaining useful life of each ATB would end at its next drydock special survey date, as management believed it was more likely than not that the Company would scrap these vessels rather than make the significant capital expenditure necessary to comply with regulatory requirements. Based on tests performed, the sum of the undiscounted cash flows for each of the six rebuilt ATBs was in excess of its September 30, 2015 carrying value and no impairment was therefore recorded at that date. As of December 31, 2015, management determined that there had been no significant changes in the facts and circumstances that existed at the end of September 30, 2015 that would warrant a change to the assumptions utilized in the undiscounted cash flows analysis on the six rebuilt ATBs prepared at that date. Accordingly, no further analysis was performed as of December 31, 2015.\nDeferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and from events that have been recognized in the financial statements and will result in taxable or deductible amounts based on provisions of the tax law in different periods. In evaluating our ability to recover our net deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. A valuation allowance is established to the extent it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future.\n \nInterest expense, including administrative and other fees, was $70,365 in 2015 and comprised primarily of $32,669 associated with the Company's reinstated Unsecured Senior Notes and $37,666 relating to the Exit Financing Facility.\nInterest rate risk\nWe believe the actions we have taken have strengthened our balance sheet and at the same time positioned us to generate sufficient cash to support our operations over the next twelve months. The Company currently plans to pay off or refinance the outstanding principal balance on its 8.125% Notes, which mature on March 30, 2018, by December 29, 2017.\nTCE revenues increased in 2015 by $128,803, or 37%, to $475,790 from $346,987 in 2014. The increase was primarily due to a strengthening of rates in all of the International Flag sectors, most significantly in the VLCC and MR fleets. These positive factors were partially offset by a 3,700-day decrease in revenue days during 2015, which was driven by (i) fewer chartered-in days in the current year, (ii) the Company's reduced participation in the full service International Flag Lightering business upon the expiry of its lightering contracts in September 2014, and (iii) the sale of two VLCCs and one Panamax in December 2014, and one MR in July 2015.\n 48 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. \nThe Company allocates the cost of acquired companies to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired, with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill. The Company's sole intangible asset represent long-term customer relationships acquired as part of the 2006 purchase of Maritrans, Inc. The events noted above under Vessel Impairment during the third quarter of 2016 also triggered an interim impairment test on its customer relationship intangible asset. The business as a whole was determined to be the lowest level at which cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities for purposes of testing the customer relationship intangible asset for recoverability. Based on the results of the recoverability test performed, no intangible assets impairment was recorded as of September 30, 2016 as the net undiscounted cash flows from the asset group were significantly in excess of the carrying value of the asset group. The Company also determined that there were no triggering events between September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016.\nVessel Lives and Salvage Values\nInterest expense in 2014 reflects interest expense of $176,234, including contractual post-petition interest from the Petition Date through the effective date of the Equity Plan of $106,400 associated with the Company's Unsecured Senior Notes and $15,282 associated with the Company's Exit Financing Facilities. The balance of interest expense recognized during 2014 represented contractual post-petition interest from the Petition Date through the effective date of the Equity Plan on allowed claims associated with our pre-reorganized OSG loan agreements (excluding reinstated Unsecured Senior Notes) and certain rejected executory contracts. Accordingly, interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 is not comparable to either 2016 or 2015.\nTCE revenues decreased in 2016 by $121,889, or 26%, to $353,901 from $475,790 in 2015. The decrease was principally as a result of a weakening in rates throughout the International Flag sectors, most significantly in the MR, VLCC, Aframax and LR2 fleets. Further contributing to the decrease was a 1,226-day decrease in revenue days, primarily as a result of (i) the 2016 period only including 11 months and (ii) a decrease in MR revenue days, as a result of the sale of a 1998-built MR in July 2015 and the redelivery of an MR to its owners at the expiry of its time charter in March 2015. The negative factors were partially offset by 477 fewer drydock and repair days in the 2016 period and an increase in revenue from the Company's ULCC being taken out of lay-up in the first quarter of 2015.\nDuring 2016, general and administrative expenses decreased by $19,932 to $41,608 from $61,540 in 2015. This decrease reflects: (i) lower compensation and benefit costs of $5,501 primarily due to a decrease in incentive compensation; and (ii) a net decrease in legal, accounting and consulting fees aggregating $16,198, as the prior period reflected higher costs incurred in the period subsequent to the Company's emergence from bankruptcy.\nDuring the eleven months ended November 30, 2016, results from vessel operations of discontinued operations decreased by $499,804 to a loss of $298,911 from income of $200,893 in the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease reflects the impact of net held-for-sale basis and held-for-use basis impairments of $332,562 and $49,640, respectively, declining TCE revenues, and the incurrence of spin-off related costs in 2016. Such impacts were partially offset by a decrease in vessel expenses, depreciation and amortization, and charter hire in the 2016 period.\nAs a result of the aforementioned closing agreement, OSG's investment in INSW for financial reporting purposes exceeded its tax basis, and as of December 31, 2015, management did not believe it could make an assertion that OSG's investment in INSW was essentially permanent in duration. Accordingly, the Company recognized a deferred tax liability and tax provision of $48,856 for the year ended December 31, 2015 on the accumulated and current year undistributed earnings of its foreign operations, aggregating approximately $138,881, arising principally from companies domiciled in the Marshall Islands.\nManagement concluded that the above indicators constituted impairment triggering events for six of the eight vessels in the Company's fleet of rebuilt ATBs at September 30, 2015. In addition, given the uncertainty around how long the weak market conditions discussed above could last, management determined that it was more likely than not that the rebuilt ATBs will be scrapped before the end of their estimated useful lives, which ranged from 2021 to 2028 (see discussion above under -Vessel Lives and Salvage Values\u201d). The indicators discussed above were not considered to be impairment triggering events for the other U.S. Flag ATBs employed in lightering and currently operating under long-term charters or contracts of affreightment agreements.\nInterest expense, including administrative and other fees was $43,151 for 2016 compared with $70,365 in 2015. The decrease in interest expense associated with the Company's Exit Financing Facilities and Unsecured Senior Notes from the prior year reflects the impact of the Company's repurchases and prepayments of $137,295 in aggregate principal amount of its OBS Term Loan in 2016 and the repurchase of $363,690 in aggregate principal amount of its outstanding Unsecured Senior Notes between the third quarter of 2015 and September 2016. Refer to Note 9, Debt,\u201d in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nThe Company believes that the availability, quality and reliability of fair market valuations of U.S Flag vessels are limited given the fact that the U.S. Flag market is relatively small and illiquid with very limited second hand sales and purchases activity from which to benchmark vessel values. As discussed in Note 6, Vessels, Deferred Drydock and Other Property,\u201d to the Company's consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d the Company monitors for any indicators of impairment in regards to the carrying value of its vessels.\n 52 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. \nOn November 30, 2016, OSG completed the separation of its business into two independent publicly-traded companies through the spin-off of INSW. INSW holds entities and other assets and liabilities that formed OSG's former International Flag business, which was made up of two reportable segments - International Crude Tankers and International Product Carriers. In accordance with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, the assets and liabilities and results of operations of INSW are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Accordingly, all references made to financial data in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are to OSG's continuing operations, unless specifically noted.\n \nAs of December 31, 2016, we had total debt outstanding (net of original issue discount and deferred finance costs) of $525,082 and a total debt to total capitalization of 67.4%. Our debt profile reflects recent actions (discussed further below) to deleverage our balance sheet as well as no scheduled amortization requirements before 2018.\nDuring 2015, general and administrative expenses increased by $9,117 to $61,540 from $52,423 in 2014. The increase primarily reflects the following: (i) higher legal, consulting and accounting fees aggregating $8,873 resulting from higher costs incurred in the period subsequent to the Company's emergence from bankruptcy; (ii) higher compensation and benefit expenses aggregating $2,485 mostly related to employee bonus programs, including certain retention programs put in place as a result of the Company's bankruptcy filing and an increase in share-based compensation; and (iii) a reduction in costs allocated and directly attributable to INSW aggregating $1,003. These increases were partially offset by lower insurance premiums of $2,964 as the 2014 period included an increase in liability insurance, principally related to the acceleration of Directors and Officers liability insurance costs in the third quarter of 2014, since the then existing coverage ended upon the Company's emergence from bankruptcy, and a one-time premium paid in the third quarter of 2014 for runoff coverage for the former directors and officers of the Company and the removal of certain exclusions in such policy.\nIn connection with the emergence from bankruptcy, under applicable U.S. tax regulations, the Company underwent an ownership change. As a result, there is an annual limitation on the use of pre-ownership change net operating losses, tax credits and certain other tax attributes to offset taxable income earned after the ownership change. The annual limitation is equal to the product of the applicable long-term tax exempt rate and the value of the Company's stock immediately before the ownership change. This annual limitation may be adjusted to reflect any unused annual limitation for prior years and certain recognized built-in gains and losses for the year. The Company does not believe that the limitations imposed will impact its ability to utilize pre-ownership change net operating losses before the carryforward period expires.\nOn June 2, 2016, the Board authorized the Company to take action to transfer the listing of its Class A common stock to the New York Stock Exchange from the NYSE MKT. In conjunction with the Transfer, the Board approved the Reverse Split Amendment to the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The Reverse Split Amendment effected a one (1) for six (6) reverse stock split and corresponding reduction of the number of authorized shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. On June 7, 2016, the Company filed the Reverse Split Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Reverse Split Amendment became effective on June 13, 2016. As previously reported, the Company's stockholders approved the filing of the Reverse Split Amendment at the Company's annual meeting of stockholders held on June 9, 2015. The Transfer was approved by the New York Stock Exchange on June 23, 2016.\nOn November 30, 2016, we completed the spinoff of INSW, which previously made up our International Crude Tankers and International Product Carriers reportable segments. The results of INSW have been classified as discontinued operations. See Note 5, Discontinued Operations,\u201d to the Company's consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 for additional information.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company repaid the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, for which INSW was liable on a joint and several basis. As a result, because INSW was no longer liable on a joint and several basis for the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company released its deferred tax liability for undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries attributable to the excess Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility over the cumulative potential deemed dividends arising from the drawdowns by OSG under such facility, and recorded an income tax benefit of $55,602. As of December 31, 2014, the Company's tax basis in its investment in INSW exceeded the book basis of such investment and the Company therefore did not record any deferred tax asset for the unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries.\n \n(2)\tAs of December 31, 2016, the Company had charter-in commitments for 10 vessels on leases that are accounted for as operating leases. These leases provide the Company with various renewal options.\t\nThe Company is currently undergoing an examination by the Internal Revenue Service of its 2012 through 2015 tax returns.\nDrydocking\nThe more significant factors that could impact management's assumptions regarding time charter equivalent rates include (i) loss or reduction in business from significant customers, (ii) unanticipated changes in demand for transportation of crude oil and petroleum products, (iii) changes in production of or demand for oil and petroleum products, generally or in particular regions, (iv) greater than anticipated levels of tanker newbuilding orders or lower than anticipated levels of tanker scrappings, and (v) changes in rules and regulations applicable to the tanker industry, including legislation adopted by international organizations such as IMO and the EU or by individual countries. Although management believes that the assumptions used to evaluate potential impairment are reasonable and appropriate at the time they were made, such assumptions are highly subjective.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n ii. the impact, if any, of management's intent to dispose of or continue to trade certain vessels during 2015; and \n 43 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. \nThe majority of revenue is generated from time charters and is accounted for as operating leases and are thus recognized ratably over the rental periods of such charters, as service is performed. The Company does not recognize time charter revenues during periods that vessels are off hire.\nIn addition to the above long-term contractual obligations the Company has certain obligations for its domestic shore-based employees as of December 31, 2016, related to pension and other post-retirement benefit plans as follows:\nIn developing estimates of future cash flows for the INSW vessels, the Company must make assumptions about future performance, with significant assumptions being related to charter rates, ship operating expenses, utilization, drydocking requirements, residual value and the estimated remaining useful lives of the vessels. These assumptions are based on historical trends as well as future expectations. Specifically, in estimating future charter rates, management takes into consideration rates currently in effect for existing time charters and estimated daily time charter equivalent rates for each vessel class for the unfixed days over the estimated remaining lives of each of the vessels. The estimated daily time charter equivalent rates used for unfixed days are based on a combination of (i) internally forecasted rates that are consistent with forecasts provided to the Company's senior management and Board of Directors, and (ii) the trailing 12-year historical average rates, based on quarterly average rates published by a third party maritime research service. The internally forecasted rates are based on management's evaluation of current economic data and trends in the shipping and oil and gas industries. Management used the published 12-year historical average rates in its assumptions because it is management's belief that the 12-year period captures an even distribution of strong and weak charter rate periods, which results in the use of an average mid-cycle rate that is more in line with management's forecast of a return to mid-cycle charter rate levels in the medium term. Recognizing that the transportation of crude oil and petroleum products is cyclical and subject to significant volatility based on factors beyond the Company's control, management believes the use of estimates based on the combination of internally forecasted rates and 12-year historical average rates calculated as of the reporting date to be reasonable.\nWorking capital from continuing operations at December 31, 2016 was approximately $181,000 compared with $110,000 at December 31, 2015. Current assets are highly liquid, consisting principally of cash, interest-bearing deposits and receivables. The Company's total cash (including restricted cash) increased by approximately $2,372 during 2016. Such increase resulted from positive cash from continuing operations, $202,000 of dividends received from INSW, and proceeds from the Proskauer litigation settlement, which is net of (i) all related out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Company during the three months ended March 31, 2016 and (ii) related amounts paid to the class action plaintiffs. These inflows were offset in part by the use of cash for repurchases and principal prepayments on outstanding debt and repurchases of outstanding Class A common stock and Class A warrants during 2016, as discussed further below.\nWe believe the following discussion provides useful additional information with respect to the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements with respect to the assets and liabilities and results of operations of INSW, which are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\n 45 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. \n \nFor the INSW vessels operating in Commercial Pools, revenues and voyage expenses are pooled and allocated to each pool's participants on a time charter equivalent basis in accordance with an agreed-upon formula. The formulas in the pool agreements for allocating gross shipping revenues net of voyage expenses are based on points allocated to participants' vessels based on cargo carrying capacity and other technical characteristics, such as speed and fuel consumption. The selection of charterers, negotiation of rates and collection of related receivables and the payment of voyage expenses are the responsibility of the pools. The pools may enter into contracts that earn either voyage charter revenue or time charter revenue. Each of the pools follows the same revenue recognition principles, as applied by the Company, in determining shipping revenues and voyage expenses, including recognizing revenue only after a charter has been agreed to by both the pool and the customer, even if the vessel has discharged its cargo and is sailing to the anticipated load port on its next voyage.\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of (i) industry operations that have an impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations, (ii) the Company's financial condition at December 31, 2016 and 2015 and its results of operations comparing the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and (iii) critical accounting policies used in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements. All dollar amounts are presented in thousands, except daily dollar amounts and per share amounts.\nIncorporated in 1969, OSG has operated through multiple shipping cycles, making adjustments to our business as needed to compete and succeed. We provide safe, efficient and reliable transportation to customers and strive to ensure the highest standards of safety and environmental compliance throughout our organization.\n \nThe average monthly rate of production from the Eagle Ford formation decreased 410,000 b/d, or 28%, in December 2016 compared with December 2015. Eagle Ford crude is transported through pipeline infrastructure to Corpus Christi, where it is loaded on Jones Act vessels for transportation to refineries in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and the Philadelphia area. The reduction in production has led to the redeployment of a number of Jones Act vessels out of the crude trades into clean product trades, placing significant downward pressure on TCE rates. As of December 2016, 26% of the Jones Act tank vessel fleet deployment was in crude trades compared with 36% in December 2015. Jones Act tank vessel deployment in US Gulf clean product trades was 44% in December 2016 compared with 35% in December 2015. Adding to the impact of declining U.S. production was the lifting of the crude oil export ban on December 18, 2015.\n 42 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. \nAggregate Contractual Obligations\nEstimated outflows for operating expenses and drydocking requirements are based on historical and budgeted costs and are adjusted for assumed inflation. Finally, utilization is based on historical levels achieved and estimates of a residual value are consistent with the pattern of scrap rates used in management's evaluation of salvage value.\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations across our global operations. ASC 740 provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, on the basis of the technical merits of the position. ASC 740 also provides guidance on measurement, derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. We recognize tax liabilities and reductions in deferred tax assets in accordance with ASC 740 and we adjust these liabilities and deferred tax assets when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available.\n 38 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. \nWe generate significant cash flows from our complementary mix of time charters, voyage charters and contracts of affreightment. Net cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2016 was $328,860. In addition to operating cash flows, our other current sources of funds are proceeds from issuances of equity securities, additional borrowings as permitted under the Exit Financing Facilities and proceeds from the opportunistic sales of our vessels. In the past we have also obtained funds from the issuance of long-term debt securities. We may in the future complete transactions consistent with achieving the objectives of our business plan.\nManagement has designated cash reserves of $5,576 as of December 31, 2016 (compared with $10,583 at December 31, 2015) to be utilized within the next twelve months for the settlement of certain unsecured claims related to the Company's emergence from bankruptcy, $5 million of which was paid on February 27, 2017. The remainder of such restricted cash reserves will be used to settle claims or released in 2017. Additionally, restricted cash as of December 31, 2016 includes approximately $10,268 of legally restricted cash relating to the Unsecured Senior Notes, $1,696 of which is classified within current assets. The remaining $8,572 is included in non-current assets. The OBS Term Loan required that upon the spin-off of INSW the Company set aside in an escrow account (1) all accrued and unpaid interest on the existing Unsecured Senior Notes through the date of the consummation of the INSW spin-off and (2) all interest expense that will accrue under the respective existing Unsecured Senior Notes from the date of the consummation of the INSW spin-off through the maturity of the respective existing Unsecured Senior Notes.\nAccordingly, management recorded a charge in the fourth quarter of 2016, as part of income/(loss) from discontinued operations of $332,562 to reduce the carrying value of the disposal group to its estimated fair value, calculated on a held for sale basis. Management believes that it has identified and evaluated all long-lived assets within the disposal group for impairment in accordance with the guidance in ASC 845. Management also took into account the market capitalization of INSW following the spin on November 30, 2016 to assess and conclude on the reasonableness of the impairment charge related to the INSW disposal group, and considered the following factors: (i) INSW was a new public entity with little analyst coverage until January 2017; (ii) currently there is a lower level of liquidity for the INSW common stock since six shareholders hold approximately 60% of INSW's shares; (iii) the stock price as of February 27, 2017 was more than 25% higher than the closing price on the date of the spin off transaction; (iv) the shipping industry is highly cyclical and in periods of negative market sentiment, such as existed at the time of the spin off transaction and that currently persists, it is common for companies to trade at discounts to NAV.\nIn addition, during the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company decided to delay the disposal of one of its rebuilt ATBs from the estimated disposal date utilized in the September 30, 2016 impairment testing. This decision resulted in a change in the expected deployment of a second rebuilt ATB, which had been projected to assume the first ATB's time charter on January 1, 2017, and a decline in its forecasted cash flows. Accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $6,623 at December 31, 2016.\nSee Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to the Company's consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nResults from Vessel Operations\nThe duration of the benefit obligation at each of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was 11.26 years and 11.71 years, respectively.\nDuring 2015, income from vessel operations improved by $172,436 to $200,893 from $28,457 in 2014. This increase reflects the impact of a significant strengthening of TCE revenues, declining charter hire expense, and decreases in depreciation and amortization, severance and technical management transition costs and general and administrative expense. Such impacts were partially offset by a period-over-period increase in vessel expenses and a reduction in gains on vessel sales in the current year.\n 51 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. \nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement determined that the latter two factors had no impact on the carrying value INSW's fleet as of December 31, 2014. However, the decline in the third party valuation appraisals on four modern MRs, which were built between 2009 and 2011, was deemed to be an impairment indicator requiring the need to test the recoverability of the carrying value of these vessels. Based on tests performed, it was determined that the vessels would generate undiscounted cash flows in excess of their December 31, 2014 carrying values over the remainder of their useful lives.\n \nImpact of Spin off\nCarrying Value of Vessels\nIn accordance with the Separation and Distribution Agreement, subsequent to the November 30, 2016 spin-off of INSW, OSG will continue to guarantee debt and other obligations of certain of INSW's equity method investees. The debt and other obligations are primarily due to banks in connection with financing the purchase and conversion of vessels and equipment used in the joint venture operations. As of December 31, 2016, the maximum potential amount of future principal payments (undiscounted) that OSG could be required to make relating to such equity method investees secured bank debt and interest rate swaps was $38,789 and the carrying amount of the liability related to this guarantee was $0. In connection with the continuing OSG guarantees, INSW will pay a $125 fee per year to OSG, which is subject to escalation after 2017. INSW has indemnified OSG for liabilities arising from the continuing OSG guarantees pursuant to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement.\nINTEREST EXPENSE\nLiquidity\n \nRESULTS FROM VESSEL OPERATIONS\n*Including current portion.\n\nOn February 29, 2016, the Board declared a cash dividend of $0.08 per share on its Class A and Class B common stock. This dividend, totaling $30,573, was paid on March 25, 2016. The declaration and timing of future cash dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of the Board and will depend upon, among other things, our future operations and earnings, capital requirements, general financial condition, contractual restrictions and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant.\nSources, Uses and Management of Capital\nA summary of the Company's long-term contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 follows:\nThe carrying value of each of the Company's vessels represents its original cost at the time it was delivered or purchased less depreciation calculated using an estimated useful life of 25 years (except for new ATBs for which estimated useful lives of 30 years are used) from the date such vessel was originally delivered from the shipyard or 20 years from the date the Company's ATBs were rebuilt. A vessel's carrying value is reduced to its new cost basis (i.e. its current fair value) if a vessel impairment charge is recorded.\nThe United States has not adopted the Hong Kong International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships (the Convention\u201d). While the Convention is not in effect in the United States, the EPA and the Maritime Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation ( MarAd\u201d) have, from time to time, required the owners of U.S. Flag vessels to make certifications regarding the presence of certain toxic substances onboard vessels that they are seeking to sell to parties who (a) are not citizens of the United States and (b) intend to recycle the vessels after they have been purchased (the \"Recycling Purchasers\"). In the event that more stringent requirements are imposed upon the owners of U.S. Flag vessels seeking to sell their vessels to the Recycling Purchasers, such requirements could (a) negatively impact the sales prices obtainable from the Recycling Purchasers or (b) require companies, including OSG, to incur additional costs in order to sell their U.S. Flag vessels to the Recycling Purchasers or to other foreign buyers intending to use such vessels for further trading. Management currently believes that $300 per lightweight ton is a reasonable estimate of recycling prices for OSG's U.S. Flag vessels.\nDecember 31, 2015 Impairment evaluation - Management gave consideration as to whether any events and changes in circumstances existed as of December 31, 2015 that could be viewed as indicators that the carrying amounts of the vessels in the Company's International Flag fleet were not recoverable as of December 31, 2015 and determined there were no such events or changes in circumstances.\nRevenue Recognition\n 53 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. \nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $308,289, which are available to reduce future taxes, if any. The federal net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2034. The amount of net operating loss carryforwards reflected in this paragraph are presented on a tax return basis and differ from the amounts reflected in the balance sheet, which are reflected net of unrecognized tax benefits.\nIn estimating the fair value of vessels for the purposes of step 2 of the impairment tests, the Company utilizes estimates of discounted future cash flows for each of the vessels (income approach) since the secondhand sale and purchase market for the type of U.S. Flag vessels owned by OSG is not considered to be robust.\nIn determining the benefit obligations at the end of the year measurement date, the Company continues to use the equivalent single weighted-average discount rate, rounded to the nearest 5 basis points, that best matches projected benefit payments. During 2016, the Company changed its actuarial service provider and, therefore, for December 31, 2016, the Company based the discount rate on such actuary's proprietary index, which was calculated based on a universe of approximately 500 Aa-graded non-callable bonds. This rate was 3.95% as of December 31, 2016. For at least the two prior years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Company used the Citigroup Above Median Pension Discount Curve applied to the future payouts under the Maritrans Plan. The rates were 4.00% and 3.75% at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Although the December 31, 2016 index was different from that used in prior years, management believes that the current results are consistent with those that would have been produced had the Company continued to use the Citigroup Above Median Pension Discount Curve as it did in 2015 and 2014. The Company also assumed a long-term rate of return on the Maritrans Plan assets of 7.25% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, based on the asset mix as of such dates and management's estimate of the long term rate of return that could be achieved over the remaining duration of the Maritrans Plan. Based on the current asset mix, management believes the probability of achieving a long-term return of 7.25% over the remaining duration of the Maritrans Plan is more likely than not.\nThe Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, which could impact its results of operations and financial condition. The Company manages this exposure to market risk through its regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. To manage its interest rate risk in a cost-effective manner, the Company, from time-to-time, enters into interest rate swap or cap agreements, in which it agrees to exchange various combinations of fixed and variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts or to receive payments if floating interest rates rise above a specified cap rate. The Company uses such derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes. In addition, derivative financial instruments are entered into with a diversified group of major financial institutions in order to manage exposure to nonperformance on such instruments by the counterparties.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company had a secured term loan (OBS Term Loan) and a revolving credit facility (OBS ABL Facility) under which borrowings bear interest at a rate based on LIBOR, plus the applicable margin, as stated in the respective loan agreements. There were no amounts outstanding under the OBS ABL Facility as of December 31, 2016.\n 46 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. \nThe Company generates a portion of its revenue from voyage charters. Within the shipping industry, there are two methods used to account for voyage charter revenue: (1) ratably over the estimated length of each voyage and (2) completed voyage. The recognition of voyage revenues ratably over the estimated length of each voyage is the most prevalent method of accounting for voyage revenues in the shipping industry and the method used by OSG. Under each method, voyages may be calculated on either a load-to-load or discharge-to-discharge basis. In applying its revenue recognition method, management believes that the discharge-to-discharge basis of calculating voyages more accurately estimates voyage results than the load-to-load basis. Since, at the time of discharge, management generally knows the next load port and expected discharge port, the discharge-to-discharge calculation of voyage revenues can be estimated with a greater degree of accuracy. OSG does not begin recognizing voyage revenue until a charter has been agreed to by both the Company and the customer, even if the vessel has discharged its cargo and is sailing to the anticipated load port on its next voyage, because it is at this time the charter rate is determinable for the specified load and discharge ports and collectability is reasonably assured.\n \nThe increase in 2015 vessel expenses resulted primarily from (i) reactivation and operating costs incurred in conjunction with the Company's ULCC being taken out of lay-up in the first quarter of 2015 and commencing a time charter in April 2015, (ii) incremental costs relating to the redelivery of one of the Company's Panamaxes that had previously been bareboat chartered-out, (iii) the recording of a $1,450 reserve in 2015 for an assessment by a multi-employer defined benefit pension plan covering British crew members that served onboard INSW vessels (as well as vessels of other owners) more than 20 years ago, (iv) the Company taking delivery of a newbuild LR2 in the second quarter of 2014, and (v) technical management fees paid to V.Ships. The Company began transferring management of its International Flag conventional tankers to V.Ships in March 2014 and completed the transfers by September of 2014. Vessel operating expenses in 2015 included approximately $7,200 in technical management fees, compared with approximately $4,100 in 2014. These increases in vessel expense were more than offset by a decrease in the cost of providing technical and commercial management by the Company's shore-based staff that were previously included in general and administrative expenses.\nThe following table presents information about the Company's financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt obligations, the table presents the principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates of the Company's debt obligations.\nThe decrease in charter hire expense in 2015 compared with 2014 was principally the result of the redeliveries of ten vessels (eight Aframaxes, one Suezmax and one MR) at the expiry of their short-term time charters in 2014. Also contributing to the decrease was the redelivery of one additional MR upon its time charter's expiration in March 2015.\nOur current uses of funds are to fund working capital requirements, maintain the quality of our vessels, comply with U.S. and international shipping standards and environmental laws and regulations, repay or repurchase our outstanding loan facilities and to repurchase our common stock from time to time. The OBS Term Loan Facility requires that a portion of Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the term loan agreement) be used to prepay the outstanding principal balance of the term loan, commencing with the annual period beginning January 1, 2015. Management determined that no incremental prepayments will be required for the OBS Term Loan Facility for 2017 as the voluntary prepayment made during the fourth quarter of 2016 exceeded any prepayments which would have been required under the OBS Term Loan Facility for 2017. To the extent permitted under the terms of the OBS Term Loan, we may also use cash generated by operations to finance capital expenditures to modernize and grow our fleet.\n \nIntangible Asset\nThe spin-off was completed pursuant to a Separation and Distribution Agreement and several other agreements with OSG related to the spin-off, including a Transition Services Agreement and an Employee Matters Agreement. These agreements govern the relationship between us and OSG following the spin-off and provide for the allocation of various assets, liabilities, rights and obligations. These agreements also include arrangements for transition services to be provided by OSG to INSW and by INSW to OSG.\n \nTwelve of the Company's owned vessels are pledged as collateral under the Exit Financing Facilities. The carrying value of each of the Company's vessels does not necessarily represent its fair market value or the amount that could be obtained if the vessel were sold.\n (c) Ship-operating days represent calendar days \nEffective as of 5:00 p.m., New York time, on November 30, 2016 (the Distribution Date\u201d), OSG completed the separation of its business into two independent publicly-traded companies through the spin-off of INSW. The spin-off separates OSG and INSW into two distinct business with separate management. OSG has retained the U.S. Flag business and INSW holds entities and other assets and liabilities that formed OSG's former International Flag business.\n 44 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. \nAs of December 31, 2016, we had total liquidity on a consolidated basis of $281,933, comprised of $206,933 of cash (including $15,844 of restricted cash) and $75,000 of undrawn revolver capacity. We manage our cash in accordance with our intercompany cash management system subject to the requirements of our Exit Financing Facilities. Our cash and cash equivalents, as well as our restricted cash balances, generally exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limits. We place our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in what we believe to be credit-worthy financial institutions. In addition, certain of our money market accounts invest in U.S. Treasury securities or other obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, or its agencies.\nVessel Impairment\nThe Parent Company's ability to receive cash dividends, loans or advances from OBS is restricted under its loan facility. The Available Amount for cash dividends, loans or advances to the Parent Company permitted under the OBS Term Loan was $0 as of December 31, 2016, after OBS's dividend distributions to the Parent Company of $51,295 during 2016. Management expects that the Available Amount will increase to $93,592 by the end of the first quarter of 2017, after the required reports are filed with the banks.\n (b) Revenue days represent ship-operating days less days that vessels were not available for employment due to repairs, drydock or lay-up. \nDecember 31, 2014 Impairment evaluation - Management gave consideration to the following events and changes in circumstances in determining whether there were any indicators that the carrying amounts of the vessels in INSW's fleet were not recoverable as of December 31, 2014:\nThe following is a discussion of the results from vessel operations of the INSW discontinued operations for the eleven months ended November 30, 2016, and for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nThe components of interest expense are as follows:\nHistorically, we have also used funds to pay dividends and to repurchase our common stock from time to time. Pursuant to the October 2015 Board resolution authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $200,000 worth of the Company's Class A and Class B common stock and warrants, we repurchased 106,350 shares of Class A common stock at an aggregate cost of $1,301. In addition, during 2016, we repurchased 55,306,351 Class A warrants at an aggregate cost of $118,041.\nIn estimating the fair value of vessels for the purposes of step 2 of the impairment tests, the Company utilizes a market approach by using third party appraisals for the vessels in the INSW fleet.\n \n \n\nThe carrying values of the Company's vessels may not represent their fair market value or the amount that could be obtained by selling the vessel at any point in time since the market prices of second-hand vessels tend to fluctuate with changes in charter rates and the cost of newbuildings. Historically, both charter rates and vessel values tend to be cyclical. Management evaluates the carrying amounts of vessels held and used by the Company for impairment only when it determines that it will sell a vessel or when events or changes in circumstances occur that cause management to believe that future cash flows for any individual vessel will be less than its carrying value. In such instances, an impairment charge would be recognized if the estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the vessel and its eventual disposition is less than the vessel's carrying amount. This assessment is made at the individual vessel level as separately identifiable cash flow information for each vessel is available.\nReconciliations of time charter equivalent revenues to shipping revenues as reported in the consolidated statements of operations follows:\nIn connection with the acquisition of Maritrans in November 2006, the Company assumed the obligations under the noncontributory defined benefit pension plan that covered eligible employees of Maritrans ( the Maritrans Plan\u201d). The Company froze the benefits payable under the Maritrans Plan as of December 31, 2006. The Company has recorded pension benefit costs based on complex valuations developed by its actuarial consultants. These valuations are based on estimates and key assumptions, including those related to the discount rates, the rates expected to be earned on investments of plan assets and the life expectancy/mortality of plan participants. OSG is required to consider market conditions in selecting a discount rate that is representative of the rates of return currently available on high-quality fixed income investments. A higher discount rate would result in a lower benefit obligation and a lower rate would result in a higher benefit obligation. The expected rate of return on plan assets is management's best estimate of expected returns on plan assets. A decrease in the expected rate of return will increase net periodic benefit costs and an increase in the expected rate of return will decrease benefit costs. The mortality assumption is management's best estimate of the expected duration of future benefit payments at the measurement date. The estimate is based on the specific demographics and other relevant facts and circumstances of the Maritrans Plan and considers all relevant information available at the measurement date. Longer life expectancies would result in higher benefit obligations and a decrease in life expectancies would result in lower benefit obligations.\nFor the pools in which INSW participates, Company management monitored, among other things, the relative proportion of INSW's vessels operating in each of the pools to the total number of vessels in each of the respective pools, and assesses whether or not INSW's participation interest in each of the pools is sufficiently significant so as to determine that INSW has effective control of the pool. Company management determined that as of June 30, 2013, it had effective control of one of the pools in which INSW participated. Such pool was not a legal entity but operated under a contractual agreement. Therefore, effective July 1, 2013 through June 30, 2014, when INSW's participation in this pool ended, INSW's allocated TCE revenues for such pool were reported on a gross basis as voyage charter revenues and voyage expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. The impact of this method of presenting earnings for this pool was an increase in both voyage charter revenues and voyage expenses of $40,454 for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nThe Company's revenues are highly sensitive to patterns of supply and demand for vessels of the size and design configurations owned and operated by the Company and the trades in which those vessels operate. Rates for the transportation of crude oil and refined petroleum products are determined by market forces such as the supply and demand for oil. The demand for oil shipments is significantly affected by the state of the global economy, level of OPEC exports and oil production in the United States. The number of vessels is affected by newbuilding deliveries and by the removal of existing vessels from service, principally because of storage, scrappings or conversions. The Company's revenues are also affected by the mix of charters between spot (Voyage Charter) and long-term (Time or Bareboat Charter). Because shipping revenues and voyage expenses are significantly affected by the mix between voyage charters and time charters, the Company manages its vessels based on TCE revenues. Management makes economic decisions based on anticipated TCE rates and evaluates financial performance based on TCE rates achieved.\n\nPension Benefits\nAs discussed in Note 5, Discontinued Operations,\u201d to the Company's consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d the accounting for the distribution of nonmonetary assets to owners of an entity in a spinoff should be based on the recorded amount (after reduction, if appropriate, for an indicated impairment of value). The nonmonetary distribution of the assets of INSW constituted the disposal of a business. Accordingly, OSG's distribution of the shares of INSW to its shareholders on November 30, 2016 was recorded based on the carrying value of the INSW disposal group, after reduction for $332,562 in net impairment charges recognized for the excess of the carrying value of the INSW disposal group over its fair value, calculated on a held for sale basis. Such impairment charges are included in the results from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2016. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies - Vessel and Investment in Joint Venture Impairments - Held for Sale Basis (Disposal Group) below for additional information on management's judgments and estimates in determining the impairment charge for the INSW disposal group.\nCompany management estimated the scrap value of INSW's vessels to be $300 per lightweight ton. The assumptions used in the determination of estimated salvage value took into account current scrap prices, the historic pattern of annual average scrap rates over the four year and eleven-month period ended November 30, 2016, which ranged from $280 to $480 per lightweight ton, estimated changes in future market demand for scrap steel and estimated future demand for vessels. Scrap prices also fluctuate depending upon type of ship, bunkers on board, spares on board and delivery range.", "item_7_text": "In estimating the fair value of INSW's investments in and advances to affiliated companies as of November 30, 2016, the Company utilized an income approach since there is a lack of comparable market transactions for the specially built assets held by the joint ventures, by preparing discounted cash flow models. In preparing the discounted cash flows models the Company used a methodology largely consistent with the methodology and assumptions detailed in the Vessel Impairment - Held for Use Basis\u201d section below, with the exception being that as the assets owned by the joint ventures serve under specific service contracts, the estimated charter rates for periods after the expiry of the existing contracts are based upon management's internally forecasted rates. The cash flows were discounted using the current estimated weighted average cost of capital for each joint venture, which ranged from 8.7% to 9.5% and took into consideration country risk, entity size and uncertainty with respect to the cash flows for periods beyond the current charter expires.\nIn developing estimates of undiscounted future cash flows for performing Step 1 of the impairment tests, management made assumptions about future performance, with significant assumptions being related to charter rates, ship operating expenses, utilization, drydocking requirements, residual value and the estimated remaining useful lives of the vessels. The assumptions about the estimated remaining useful lives of the ATBs reflects management's current belief that the Company would scrap these ATBs at the expiry of their current time charters. Based on tests performed, the sum of the undiscounted cash flows for seven of the eight rebuilt ATBs were less than their September 30, 2016 carrying values. Accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $97,782 (including $3,873 recorded as a reduction in deferred drydock costs) to write down the carrying values of the seven ATBs to their estimated fair values as of September 30, 2016.\nSeptember 30, 2016 Impairment evaluation - Management concluded that declines in third party vessel valuations of up to 20% during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 for 28 vessels in INSW's fleet with carrying values in excess of their estimated market values, constituted an impairment trigger event for these vessels as of September 30, 2016. Based upon the impairment tests performed impairment charges totaling $49,640 were recorded on two LR1s, an Aframax and a Panamax to write-down their carrying values to their estimated fair values at September 30, 2016. The remaining 24 vessels tested had estimated undiscounted future cash flows in excess of their carrying values.\n \u00b7 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; \u00b7 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and \u00b7 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt. \nInternational Flag Fleet Impairment Evaluations\n 40 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. \nThe decreases in vessel expenses, depreciation and amortization and charter hire during the 2016 period are principally as a result of factors impacting revenue days described above.\nThe following table reconciles net income/(loss) from continuing operations, as reflected in the consolidated statements of operations set forth in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\n\n \nThe industry's firm Jones Act orderbook as of December 31, 2016, with deliveries scheduled through the fourth quarter of 2017 consisted of nine vessels (five Product Carriers and four large ATBs). Options for an additional three ATBs remain open. The Company does not have any Jones Act vessels on order.\nVessel expenses increased by $2,517 to $140,696 in 2016 from $138,179 in 2015, primarily due to an increase in average daily vessel expenses of $249 per day, which resulted principally from higher crew costs. Depreciation expense increased by $12,826 to $89,257 in 2016 from $76,431 in 2015 primarily as a result of the shortening of the useful lives of six of the Company's Jones Act ATBs effective October 1, 2015 and a further shortening of the useful lives of seven of the Jones Act ATBs effective October 1, 2016, as discussed further in Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nVessel Impairment - Held for Use Basis\n \nINTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY\nWithin the shipping industry, there are two methods that are used to account for dry dockings: (1) capitalize drydocking costs as incurred (deferral method) and amortize such costs over the period to the next scheduled drydocking, and (2) expense drydocking costs as incurred. Since drydocking cycles typically extend over two and a half years or five years, management uses the deferral method because management believes it provides a better matching of revenues and expenses than the expense-as-incurred method.\n \nAs discussed in Note 5, Discontinued Operations,\u201d to the Company's consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d ASC 845 requires that the accounting for the distribution of nonmonetary assets to owners of an entity in a spinoff be based on the historical recorded amount, after reduction, if appropriate, for an indicated impairment of value, calculated on a held for sale basis.\n (1) Represents estimated contributions under the Maritrans Inc. defined benefit retirement plan. \nThe following table provides a breakdown of TCE rates achieved for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 between spot and fixed earnings and the related revenue days.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, our effective tax rate decreased compared with the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of the absence of the tax benefit attributable to the Pre-Filing Agreement with the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d) in 2015, offset in part by the reversal of the deferred tax liability associated with the Company's investment in INSW.\n \n 39 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. \nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, in evaluating whether or not certain events or circumstances existing at that time resulted in a triggering event for impairment testing of the U.S. Flag fleet, management gave consideration to various indicators of a weakening of the Jones Act crude oil transportation market that began to materialize during the period. Such indicators included a decline in U.S crude oil production beginning in May 2015 following a decrease in oil prices beginning in late 2014, which quickly led to steep cuts in drilling activity. The resulting decrease in demand for the coastwise transportation of crude oil led to a decline in average daily spot rates for Jones Act tankers during the nine-month period ending September 30, 2015 and the redeployment of several Jones Act vessels, including some of the Company's vessels, from the crude oil transportation trade to the clean oil transportation trade. In addition, the decline in U.S. crude oil production coupled with the large orderbook for Jones Act vessels scheduled for delivery through late 2017 increased uncertainty around the likelihood of being able to renew or extend the time charters on the Company's fleet of eight rebuilt Jones Act ATBs, of which two expired during 2016 and four are scheduled to expire in the second quarter of 2017. Management believed that if the weakness identified in the market continued for a prolonged period of time, it would become increasingly difficult for the Company's older ATBs to find employment at attractive rates that justify the expenditure required to put these vessels through their next drydock special surveys.\n 50 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. \n 47 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. \nWhile EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by companies as a measure of operating results and performance, neither of those items as prepared by the Company is necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to differences in methods of calculation.\nThe spin-off transaction was in the form of a pro rata distribution of INSW common stock to OSG's stockholders and warrant holders of record as of the close of business on November 18, 2016 (the Record Date.\u201d) On the Distribution Date, each holder of OSG common stock received 0.3333 shares of INSW common stock for every share of OSG common stock held on the Record Date. Each holder of OSG warrants received 0.3333 shares of INSW common stock for every one share of OSG common stock they would have received if they exercised their warrants immediately prior to the Distribution (or 0.063327 INSW shares per warrant).\nEBITDA represents net (loss)/income from continuing operations before interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA consists of EBITDA adjusted for the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented to provide investors with meaningful additional information that management uses to monitor ongoing operating results and evaluate trends over comparative periods. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent, and should not be considered a substitute for, net income or cash flows from operations determined in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations are:\nINCOME TAX BENEFIT FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS\nVessel and Investment in Joint Venture Impairments - Held for Sale Basis (Disposal Group)\nTwo reflagged U.S. Flag Product Carriers participate in the U.S. Maritime Security Program, which ensures that privately-owned, military-useful U.S. Flag vessels are available to the U.S. Department of Defense in the event of war or national emergency. Each of the vessel-owning companies receives an annual subsidy, subject in each case to annual congressional appropriations, which is intended to offset the increased cost incurred by such vessels from operating under the U.S. Flag. In December 2015, the annual subsidy was increased and the Company expects to receive $5.0 million from 2017 through 2020, and $5.2 million beginning in 2021. As of December 31, 2016 funds had not been appropriated for the fiscal year 2017 vessel subsidy of $5.0 million. The Company does not receive the subsidy with respect to any days for which one or both of the vessels operate under a time charter to a U.S. government agency, which was the case for one vessel during the third quarter of 2016.\nVessel expenses increased by $3,100 to $138,179 in 2015 from $135,079 in 2014, primarily due to an increase in average daily vessel expenses of $654 per day, which resulted principally from higher crew costs. Depreciation expense increased by $9,847 to $76,431 in 2015 from $66,584 in 2014. Such increase reflects (i) the depreciation of costs incurred in 2014 to convert the conventional Jones Act Product Carrier referred to above into a shuttle tanker, (ii) the impact on amortization of drydock costs incurred during 2015, which were approximately $16,000 higher than drydock costs incurred during 2014 as more vessels were drydocked in 2015 and (iii) the reduction in useful lives of the Company's rebuilt Jones Act ATBs.\nOur business is capital intensive. Our ability to successfully implement our strategy is dependent on the continued availability of capital on attractive terms. In addition, our ability to successfully operate our business to meet near-term and long-term debt repayment obligations is dependent on maintaining sufficient liquidity.\nCritical Accounting Policies of the Company's Discontinued Operations\n 41 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. \nIn late 2014, the Society of Actuaries ( RPEC\u201d) published a new set of mortality tables (RP-2014) and a related, mortality improvement scale (MP-2014). The Company's policy is to utilize the latest published mortality tables and improvement scales, without adjustment to determine the year-end benefit obligation. The set of mortality tables used in determining the net benefit cost for 2016 as well as the December 31, 2015 end of year measurement is the RP-2016 mortality tables, with separate rates for male non-annuitants and annuitants and for female non-annuitants and annuitants. Gender-distinct generational mortality improvements under Scale MP-2015 were included. For the 2016 end of year measurement of the benefit obligations, the RP-2014 mortality tables with generational mortality improvements under Scale MP-2016 were used. Management believes the use of the unadjusted tables is appropriate given the diversity of the participants of the Maritrans Plan, which include both inter-waterway tug officers and office employees.\nWe are a leading provider of energy transportation services, delivering crude oil and petroleum products. We own and operate a combined fleet of 24 vessels registered in the United States. Our well maintained fleet and commitment to high quality, incident-free service positions us as a preferred service provider of major oil companies and refiners.\nOPERATIONS AND OIL TANKER MARKETS\nDuring 2016, TCE revenues decreased by $2,898, or 1%, to $446,160 from $449,058 in 2015. A weakening Jones Act crude oil transportation market during the current year resulted in a decline in average daily rates earned by the Company's Jones Act ATBs and Jones Act Product Carriers, as well as increased spot market exposure, which accounted for a $16,204 decrease in revenue. The spot rates in the above table for Jones Act Product Carriers reflect idle days awaiting cargoes for one of the vessels that redelivered from a long-term charter in mid-June 2016. Offsetting this decrease to a large degree was (i) a 266-day increase in Jones Act ATB, Jones Act Product Carrier and Non-Jones Act Product Carrier revenue days, which accounted for a $11,175 increase in revenue, (ii) a $1,219 increase in Delaware Bay lightering revenue, and (iii) increased average daily rates for the Company's Non-Jones Act Product Carriers which accounted for a $911 increase in revenue. The increase in revenue days was principally attributable to a reduction in drydock and repair days in the current year. The increase in revenue earned by the Delaware Bay lightering vessels was primarily due to an increase in Delaware Bay lightering volumes and an 81-day decrease in drydock and repair days in the current year, partially offset by certain coastwise voyage opportunities that were available in the first half of 2015, but not in 2016.\nOur business operates as a single reportable segment. We believe that this is appropriate as our chief decision maker and our management team make decisions about resource allocations and review and measure our results as one line of business with similar regulatory requirements, customers and commodities transported. Our fleet includes tankers and ATBs, of which 22 operate under the Jones Act and two operate internationally and participate in the MSP. We own ten ATBs, which consist of eight vessels that transport primarily petroleum products and two that perform lightering operations in the Delaware Bay. We operate fourteen tankers, ten that have been chartered-in under operating leases and four that we own, including the two that participate in the MSP. Revenues are derived predominantly from time charter agreements, which provide a more predictable level of revenues. We derived approximately 17% of our total TCE revenues in the spot market for 2016.\n i. A significant year-over-year decline in third party valuation appraisals of four MRs securing the INSW term loan; \nOutlook\nDuring 2015, TCE revenues increased by $34,685, or 8%, to $449,058 from $414,373 in 2014. Growth in the average daily rates earned by the Company's Jones Act Product Carriers and Jones Act ATBs accounted for $33,689 of such increase. This increase reflected the strength of the Jones Act market in 2015, which allowed the Jones Act Product Carriers and ATBs to generally achieve higher rates on new or extended time charters upon the expiry of existing time charters through the first half of 2015. Contributing to an increase in TCE revenues in the second half of 2015 was the June 2015 commencement of a ten-year time charter out entered into by one of the Company's Jones Act Product Carriers that had been converted into a shuttle tanker.\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require the Company to make estimates in the application of its accounting policies based on the best assumptions, judgments, and opinions of management. Following is a discussion of the accounting policies that involve a higher degree of judgment and the methods of their application. For a description of all of the Company's material accounting policies, see Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the Company's consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\n (a) Income from vessel operations is before general and administrative expenses, depreciation on non-vessel related fixed assets, technical management transition costs, severance costs, and gain/(loss) on disposal of vessels, including impairments. \nEstimated TCE rates for prompt Jones Act Product Carriers and large ATBs decreased during the year ended December 31, 2016 from 2015 for each class of vessel. The decrease in 2016 compared with 2015 can be attributed to market uncertainty created by the decline in oil prices, the degree to which sustained low prices might cause U.S. crude oil production to decline further, and the increase in vessel supply.\nIn January 2015, the Company requested that the IRS review under its Pre-Filing Agreement Program the deductibility of certain payments made by OSG in 2014, in the aggregate amount of $477,835, in its capacity as guarantor of the obligations of subsidiaries of INSW under certain loan agreements. In connection with these payments, the Company had established an unrecognized tax benefit equal to the full amount of such benefits, or $179,151 as of December 31, 2014. On September 4, 2015, the Company received an executed closing agreement from the IRS, which allowed a deduction of $424,523. As a result of the closing agreement, the Company reduced its reserve for uncertain tax positions by $179,151, recognized an income tax benefit of $150,073 and reduced its deferred tax asset for net operating loss carryforwards by $29,078 during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nGENERAL\n (2) Amounts are estimated based on the 2016 cost taking the assumed health care cost trend rate for 2017 to 2021 into consideration. See Note 17, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans,\u201d to the Company's consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8,\u201d Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d Because of the subjective nature of the assumptions made, actual premiums paid in future years may differ significantly from the estimated amounts. \nNewly Issued Accounting Standards\nThe effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were 98.4%, 493.7% and 44.8%, respectively. The Company's effective tax rates are affected by recurring items, such as permanent differences (and their relative amount versus income) and discrete items that may occur in one year but are not consistent from year to year.\nAs of December 31, 2016, as a result of the spin-off of INSW, the Company reversed its deferred tax liability in the amount of $48,856 recognized on the basis difference in its investment in INSW as the Spin-off resulted in a non-deductible taxable loss on the Company's investment in INSW.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the industry's entire Jones Act fleet of Product Carriers and large ATBs (defined as vessels having carrying capacities of between 140,000 barrels and 350,000 barrels, which excludes numerous tank barges below 140,000-barrel capacity and 11 much larger tankers dedicated exclusively to the Alaskan crude oil trade) consisted of 90 vessels, compared with 79 vessels as of December 31, 2015. There were 12 deliveries and two vessels scrapped during 2016. The deliveries included eight Product Tankers and four ATBs. The scrapped vessels were two tankers, one of which was a late 1970s-built Alaskan crude tanker redeployed into the lower-48 coastwise trade during 2015, which was not part of the 79 vessel count noted above. In addition to the 90 vessels mentioned above, one late-1970s-built Alaskan crude tanker was sold by Exxon to competitors and redeployed into the lower-48 coastwise trade during 2015.\n\n\nDelaware Bay lightering volumes averaged 172,000 b/d in 2016 compared with 105,000 b/d in 2015. The increase resulted from imported crude oil becoming more economically attractive to Delaware Bay refiners compared with the cost of transporting domestically produced shale oil on vessels that do not require lightering services.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our effective tax rate increased by approximately 449% compared with the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily as a result of the Pre-Filing Agreement with the IRS offset in part by the deferred tax liability recognized on the Company's investment in INSW.\nAlthough management believes that the assumptions used to determine the scrap rate for its International Flag vessels are reasonable and appropriate, such assumptions are highly subjective, in part, because of the cyclicality of the nature of future demand for scrap steel.\n\nINSW generates a majority of its revenue from voyage charters, including vessels in pools that predominantly perform voyage charters, and recognizes revenue ratably over the estimated length of each voyage using the discharge-to-discharge basis.\nDuring 2016, we repurchased and retired $294 of our outstanding 2024 Notes and $37,345 of our 2018 Notes. Also, during 2016, OBS opportunistically repurchased and retired $27,000 of the outstanding principal under the OBS Term Loan at a discounted price of $23,584. During the year ended December 31, 2016, OBS also made optional and mandatory principal prepayments of $59,000 and $51,295, respectively.\nIf the estimated economic lives assigned to the Company's vessels prove to be too long because of new regulations, an extended period of weak markets, the broad imposition of age restrictions by the Company's customers, or other future events, it could result in higher depreciation expense and impairment losses in future periods related to a reduction in the useful lives of any affected vessels. In evaluating various impairment indicators that existed at September 30, 2015 (as discussed below under Vessel Impairment) management believed at that time that it was more likely than not that the Company would scrap six of its rebuilt ATBs at the time of their next scheduled drydock special survey date rather than make the significant capital expenditures necessary to comply with regulatory requirements. Accordingly, the remaining useful lives for such ATBs were adjusted on a prospective basis beginning on October 1, 2015. This reduction in useful lives increased depreciation expense on these vessels by approximately $3,600 per quarter. During the third quarter of 2016, management evaluated various impairment indicators that existed at the end of such period and as a result, determined that it was more likely than not that the Company would scrap seven of its rebuilt ATBs prior to their then estimated disposal date as described above. Accordingly, the remaining useful lives for such ATBs were further adjusted. This reduction in useful lives negatively impacted depreciation expense attributable to the ATB vessel impairments discussed in Note 6, Vessels, Deferred Drydock and Other Property,\u201d by approximately $2,200 per quarter beginning on October 1, 2016.\nOur income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes primarily in the U.S. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense.\nLIQUIDITY AND SOURCES OF CAPITAL\nThe determination of fair value is highly judgmental. In estimating the fair value of INSW's vessels as of November 30, 2016 the Company considered the market and income approaches by using a combination of third party appraisals and discounted cash flow models prepared by the Company. In preparing the discounted cash flow models, the Company used a methodology consistent with the methodology and assumptions detailed in the Vessel Impairment - Held for Use Basis\u201d section below, and discounted the cash flows using its current estimate of INSW's weighted average cost of capital, of 9%.\n iii. the impact, if any, of outsourcing technical and commercial management of the INSW conventional tanker fleet. \nThe Company considered changes in circumstances that appeared to be indicative of a continued weakening of the Jones Act crude oil transportation market during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. Such indicators included a decline in the number of Jones Act tank vessels transporting crude oil, which led to (i) increased competition for clean cargoes and the idling of some Jones Act vessels; (ii) a sharp decrease in estimated spot rates for Jones Act Product Carriers and large ATBs between July and September 2016; and (iii) a significant decline in forecasted near term TCE rates reported by a leading third party industry analyst. These factors were viewed as an impairment trigger event for the Company's eight rebuilt ATBs at September 30, 2016. In addition, given the uncertainty around how long the weak market conditions discussed above could last taking into consideration the large number of newbuildings scheduled for delivery, management believed that it was more likely than not that some of the rebuilt ATBs would be laid-up, scrapped or disposed of before the end of their estimated useful lives, which currently range between 2019 and 2020.The indicators discussed above were not considered to be impairment triggering events for the other ATBs and tankers in the Company's fleet as these vessels (i) were fairly recently built and do not face the same commercial obsolescence issues faced by the rebuilt ATBs, and (ii) are currently operating under long-term charters or contracts of affreightment.\n 49 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. \nThe decrease in depreciation and amortization in 2015 compared with 2014 was primarily due to the vessel sales noted above. This decrease was partially offset by the impact of the LR2 newbuild delivery referred to above.\nThe carrying value of each of INSW's vessels represented its original cost at the time it was delivered or purchased less depreciation calculated using an estimated useful life of 25 years (except for FSO service vessels for which estimated useful lives of 30 years are used and LNG Carriers for which estimated useful lives of 35 years are used) from the date such vessel was originally delivered from the shipyard. A vessel's carrying value is reduced to its new cost basis (i.e. its current fair value) if a vessel impairment charge is recorded.\nVessel Lives and Salvage Values\nIncome Taxes, Deferred Tax Assets and Valuation Allowance\nRevenue Recognition\nIn developing estimates of future cash flows, the Company must make assumptions about future performance, with significant assumptions being related to charter rates, ship operating expenses, utilization, drydocking requirements, residual value and the estimated remaining useful lives of the vessels. These assumptions are based on historical trends as well as future expectations. Specifically, in estimating future charter rates, management takes into consideration rates currently in effect for existing time charters and estimated daily time charter equivalent rates for each vessel class for the unfixed days over the estimated remaining lives of each of the vessels. The estimated daily time charter equivalent rates used for unfixed days beyond the expiry of any current time charters are based on internally forecasted rates that take into consideration average annual rates published by a third party maritime research service and are consistent with forecasts provided to the Company's senior management and Board of Directors. The internally forecasted rates are based on management's evaluation of current economic data and trends in the shipping and oil and gas industries. Recognizing that the transportation of crude oil and petroleum products is cyclical and subject to significant volatility based on factors beyond the Company's control, management believes the use of estimates based on the internally forecasted rates to be reasonable.\nPrincipal (Notional) Amount (dollars in millions) by Expected Maturity and Average Interest (Swap) Rate\nAt December 31, 2016, OBS was party to an interest rate cap agreement ( Interest Rate Cap\u201d) with a date of February 15, 2015 with major financial institutions covering the notional amount of $375,000, to limit the floating interest rate exposure associated with its term loan. This agreement contains no leverage features. The OBS Interest Rate Cap has a cap rate of 2.5% through February 5, 2017, at which time the cap rate increases to 3.0% through the termination date of February 5, 2018.\n(1)\tAmounts shown include contractual interest obligations. Interest obligations on fixed rate debt of $82,310 as of December 31, 2016 range from 7.5% to 8.125%. The interest rate obligations of floating rate debt have been estimated based on the aggregate of the LIBOR floor rate of 1% and the applicable margin for the OBS Term Loan of 4.25%. Management believes that no prepayment in 2017 is required for the OBS Term Loan as a result of Excess Cash Flow for the twelve- month period ended December 31, 2016. Amounts shown for the OBS Term Loan for years subsequent to 2017 exclude any estimated repayment as a result of Excess Cash Flow.\t\nManagement prepared undiscounted cash flows models, which utilized weighted probabilities assigned to possible outcomes for the six rebuilt ATBs. A significant probability was assigned to the possibility that the estimated remaining useful life of each ATB would end at its next drydock special survey date, as management believed it was more likely than not that the Company would scrap these vessels rather than make the significant capital expenditure necessary to comply with regulatory requirements. Based on tests performed, the sum of the undiscounted cash flows for each of the six rebuilt ATBs was in excess of its September 30, 2015 carrying value and no impairment was therefore recorded at that date. As of December 31, 2015, management determined that there had been no significant changes in the facts and circumstances that existed at the end of September 30, 2015 that would warrant a change to the assumptions utilized in the undiscounted cash flows analysis on the six rebuilt ATBs prepared at that date. Accordingly, no further analysis was performed as of December 31, 2015.\nDeferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and from events that have been recognized in the financial statements and will result in taxable or deductible amounts based on provisions of the tax law in different periods. In evaluating our ability to recover our net deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. A valuation allowance is established to the extent it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future.\n \nInterest expense, including administrative and other fees, was $70,365 in 2015 and comprised primarily of $32,669 associated with the Company's reinstated Unsecured Senior Notes and $37,666 relating to the Exit Financing Facility.\nInterest rate risk\nWe believe the actions we have taken have strengthened our balance sheet and at the same time positioned us to generate sufficient cash to support our operations over the next twelve months. The Company currently plans to pay off or refinance the outstanding principal balance on its 8.125% Notes, which mature on March 30, 2018, by December 29, 2017.\nTCE revenues increased in 2015 by $128,803, or 37%, to $475,790 from $346,987 in 2014. The increase was primarily due to a strengthening of rates in all of the International Flag sectors, most significantly in the VLCC and MR fleets. These positive factors were partially offset by a 3,700-day decrease in revenue days during 2015, which was driven by (i) fewer chartered-in days in the current year, (ii) the Company's reduced participation in the full service International Flag Lightering business upon the expiry of its lightering contracts in September 2014, and (iii) the sale of two VLCCs and one Panamax in December 2014, and one MR in July 2015.\n 48 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. \nThe Company allocates the cost of acquired companies to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired, with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill. The Company's sole intangible asset represent long-term customer relationships acquired as part of the 2006 purchase of Maritrans, Inc. The events noted above under Vessel Impairment during the third quarter of 2016 also triggered an interim impairment test on its customer relationship intangible asset. The business as a whole was determined to be the lowest level at which cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities for purposes of testing the customer relationship intangible asset for recoverability. Based on the results of the recoverability test performed, no intangible assets impairment was recorded as of September 30, 2016 as the net undiscounted cash flows from the asset group were significantly in excess of the carrying value of the asset group. The Company also determined that there were no triggering events between September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016.\nVessel Lives and Salvage Values\nInterest expense in 2014 reflects interest expense of $176,234, including contractual post-petition interest from the Petition Date through the effective date of the Equity Plan of $106,400 associated with the Company's Unsecured Senior Notes and $15,282 associated with the Company's Exit Financing Facilities. The balance of interest expense recognized during 2014 represented contractual post-petition interest from the Petition Date through the effective date of the Equity Plan on allowed claims associated with our pre-reorganized OSG loan agreements (excluding reinstated Unsecured Senior Notes) and certain rejected executory contracts. Accordingly, interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 is not comparable to either 2016 or 2015.\nTCE revenues decreased in 2016 by $121,889, or 26%, to $353,901 from $475,790 in 2015. The decrease was principally as a result of a weakening in rates throughout the International Flag sectors, most significantly in the MR, VLCC, Aframax and LR2 fleets. Further contributing to the decrease was a 1,226-day decrease in revenue days, primarily as a result of (i) the 2016 period only including 11 months and (ii) a decrease in MR revenue days, as a result of the sale of a 1998-built MR in July 2015 and the redelivery of an MR to its owners at the expiry of its time charter in March 2015. The negative factors were partially offset by 477 fewer drydock and repair days in the 2016 period and an increase in revenue from the Company's ULCC being taken out of lay-up in the first quarter of 2015.\nDuring 2016, general and administrative expenses decreased by $19,932 to $41,608 from $61,540 in 2015. This decrease reflects: (i) lower compensation and benefit costs of $5,501 primarily due to a decrease in incentive compensation; and (ii) a net decrease in legal, accounting and consulting fees aggregating $16,198, as the prior period reflected higher costs incurred in the period subsequent to the Company's emergence from bankruptcy.\nDuring the eleven months ended November 30, 2016, results from vessel operations of discontinued operations decreased by $499,804 to a loss of $298,911 from income of $200,893 in the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease reflects the impact of net held-for-sale basis and held-for-use basis impairments of $332,562 and $49,640, respectively, declining TCE revenues, and the incurrence of spin-off related costs in 2016. Such impacts were partially offset by a decrease in vessel expenses, depreciation and amortization, and charter hire in the 2016 period.\nAs a result of the aforementioned closing agreement, OSG's investment in INSW for financial reporting purposes exceeded its tax basis, and as of December 31, 2015, management did not believe it could make an assertion that OSG's investment in INSW was essentially permanent in duration. Accordingly, the Company recognized a deferred tax liability and tax provision of $48,856 for the year ended December 31, 2015 on the accumulated and current year undistributed earnings of its foreign operations, aggregating approximately $138,881, arising principally from companies domiciled in the Marshall Islands.\nManagement concluded that the above indicators constituted impairment triggering events for six of the eight vessels in the Company's fleet of rebuilt ATBs at September 30, 2015. In addition, given the uncertainty around how long the weak market conditions discussed above could last, management determined that it was more likely than not that the rebuilt ATBs will be scrapped before the end of their estimated useful lives, which ranged from 2021 to 2028 (see discussion above under -Vessel Lives and Salvage Values\u201d). The indicators discussed above were not considered to be impairment triggering events for the other U.S. Flag ATBs employed in lightering and currently operating under long-term charters or contracts of affreightment agreements.\nInterest expense, including administrative and other fees was $43,151 for 2016 compared with $70,365 in 2015. The decrease in interest expense associated with the Company's Exit Financing Facilities and Unsecured Senior Notes from the prior year reflects the impact of the Company's repurchases and prepayments of $137,295 in aggregate principal amount of its OBS Term Loan in 2016 and the repurchase of $363,690 in aggregate principal amount of its outstanding Unsecured Senior Notes between the third quarter of 2015 and September 2016. Refer to Note 9, Debt,\u201d in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nThe Company believes that the availability, quality and reliability of fair market valuations of U.S Flag vessels are limited given the fact that the U.S. Flag market is relatively small and illiquid with very limited second hand sales and purchases activity from which to benchmark vessel values. As discussed in Note 6, Vessels, Deferred Drydock and Other Property,\u201d to the Company's consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d the Company monitors for any indicators of impairment in regards to the carrying value of its vessels.\n 52 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. \nOn November 30, 2016, OSG completed the separation of its business into two independent publicly-traded companies through the spin-off of INSW. INSW holds entities and other assets and liabilities that formed OSG's former International Flag business, which was made up of two reportable segments - International Crude Tankers and International Product Carriers. In accordance with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, the assets and liabilities and results of operations of INSW are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Accordingly, all references made to financial data in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are to OSG's continuing operations, unless specifically noted.\n \nAs of December 31, 2016, we had total debt outstanding (net of original issue discount and deferred finance costs) of $525,082 and a total debt to total capitalization of 67.4%. Our debt profile reflects recent actions (discussed further below) to deleverage our balance sheet as well as no scheduled amortization requirements before 2018.\nDuring 2015, general and administrative expenses increased by $9,117 to $61,540 from $52,423 in 2014. The increase primarily reflects the following: (i) higher legal, consulting and accounting fees aggregating $8,873 resulting from higher costs incurred in the period subsequent to the Company's emergence from bankruptcy; (ii) higher compensation and benefit expenses aggregating $2,485 mostly related to employee bonus programs, including certain retention programs put in place as a result of the Company's bankruptcy filing and an increase in share-based compensation; and (iii) a reduction in costs allocated and directly attributable to INSW aggregating $1,003. These increases were partially offset by lower insurance premiums of $2,964 as the 2014 period included an increase in liability insurance, principally related to the acceleration of Directors and Officers liability insurance costs in the third quarter of 2014, since the then existing coverage ended upon the Company's emergence from bankruptcy, and a one-time premium paid in the third quarter of 2014 for runoff coverage for the former directors and officers of the Company and the removal of certain exclusions in such policy.\nIn connection with the emergence from bankruptcy, under applicable U.S. tax regulations, the Company underwent an ownership change. As a result, there is an annual limitation on the use of pre-ownership change net operating losses, tax credits and certain other tax attributes to offset taxable income earned after the ownership change. The annual limitation is equal to the product of the applicable long-term tax exempt rate and the value of the Company's stock immediately before the ownership change. This annual limitation may be adjusted to reflect any unused annual limitation for prior years and certain recognized built-in gains and losses for the year. The Company does not believe that the limitations imposed will impact its ability to utilize pre-ownership change net operating losses before the carryforward period expires.\nOn June 2, 2016, the Board authorized the Company to take action to transfer the listing of its Class A common stock to the New York Stock Exchange from the NYSE MKT. In conjunction with the Transfer, the Board approved the Reverse Split Amendment to the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The Reverse Split Amendment effected a one (1) for six (6) reverse stock split and corresponding reduction of the number of authorized shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. On June 7, 2016, the Company filed the Reverse Split Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Reverse Split Amendment became effective on June 13, 2016. As previously reported, the Company's stockholders approved the filing of the Reverse Split Amendment at the Company's annual meeting of stockholders held on June 9, 2015. The Transfer was approved by the New York Stock Exchange on June 23, 2016.\nOn November 30, 2016, we completed the spinoff of INSW, which previously made up our International Crude Tankers and International Product Carriers reportable segments. The results of INSW have been classified as discontinued operations. See Note 5, Discontinued Operations,\u201d to the Company's consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 for additional information.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company repaid the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, for which INSW was liable on a joint and several basis. As a result, because INSW was no longer liable on a joint and several basis for the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company released its deferred tax liability for undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries attributable to the excess Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility over the cumulative potential deemed dividends arising from the drawdowns by OSG under such facility, and recorded an income tax benefit of $55,602. As of December 31, 2014, the Company's tax basis in its investment in INSW exceeded the book basis of such investment and the Company therefore did not record any deferred tax asset for the unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries.\n \n(2)\tAs of December 31, 2016, the Company had charter-in commitments for 10 vessels on leases that are accounted for as operating leases. These leases provide the Company with various renewal options.\t\nThe Company is currently undergoing an examination by the Internal Revenue Service of its 2012 through 2015 tax returns.\nDrydocking\nThe more significant factors that could impact management's assumptions regarding time charter equivalent rates include (i) loss or reduction in business from significant customers, (ii) unanticipated changes in demand for transportation of crude oil and petroleum products, (iii) changes in production of or demand for oil and petroleum products, generally or in particular regions, (iv) greater than anticipated levels of tanker newbuilding orders or lower than anticipated levels of tanker scrappings, and (v) changes in rules and regulations applicable to the tanker industry, including legislation adopted by international organizations such as IMO and the EU or by individual countries. Although management believes that the assumptions used to evaluate potential impairment are reasonable and appropriate at the time they were made, such assumptions are highly subjective.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n ii. the impact, if any, of management's intent to dispose of or continue to trade certain vessels during 2015; and \n 43 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. \nThe majority of revenue is generated from time charters and is accounted for as operating leases and are thus recognized ratably over the rental periods of such charters, as service is performed. The Company does not recognize time charter revenues during periods that vessels are off hire.\nIn addition to the above long-term contractual obligations the Company has certain obligations for its domestic shore-based employees as of December 31, 2016, related to pension and other post-retirement benefit plans as follows:\nIn developing estimates of future cash flows for the INSW vessels, the Company must make assumptions about future performance, with significant assumptions being related to charter rates, ship operating expenses, utilization, drydocking requirements, residual value and the estimated remaining useful lives of the vessels. These assumptions are based on historical trends as well as future expectations. Specifically, in estimating future charter rates, management takes into consideration rates currently in effect for existing time charters and estimated daily time charter equivalent rates for each vessel class for the unfixed days over the estimated remaining lives of each of the vessels. The estimated daily time charter equivalent rates used for unfixed days are based on a combination of (i) internally forecasted rates that are consistent with forecasts provided to the Company's senior management and Board of Directors, and (ii) the trailing 12-year historical average rates, based on quarterly average rates published by a third party maritime research service. The internally forecasted rates are based on management's evaluation of current economic data and trends in the shipping and oil and gas industries. Management used the published 12-year historical average rates in its assumptions because it is management's belief that the 12-year period captures an even distribution of strong and weak charter rate periods, which results in the use of an average mid-cycle rate that is more in line with management's forecast of a return to mid-cycle charter rate levels in the medium term. Recognizing that the transportation of crude oil and petroleum products is cyclical and subject to significant volatility based on factors beyond the Company's control, management believes the use of estimates based on the combination of internally forecasted rates and 12-year historical average rates calculated as of the reporting date to be reasonable.\nWorking capital from continuing operations at December 31, 2016 was approximately $181,000 compared with $110,000 at December 31, 2015. Current assets are highly liquid, consisting principally of cash, interest-bearing deposits and receivables. The Company's total cash (including restricted cash) increased by approximately $2,372 during 2016. Such increase resulted from positive cash from continuing operations, $202,000 of dividends received from INSW, and proceeds from the Proskauer litigation settlement, which is net of (i) all related out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Company during the three months ended March 31, 2016 and (ii) related amounts paid to the class action plaintiffs. These inflows were offset in part by the use of cash for repurchases and principal prepayments on outstanding debt and repurchases of outstanding Class A common stock and Class A warrants during 2016, as discussed further below.\nWe believe the following discussion provides useful additional information with respect to the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements with respect to the assets and liabilities and results of operations of INSW, which are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\n 45 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. \n \nFor the INSW vessels operating in Commercial Pools, revenues and voyage expenses are pooled and allocated to each pool's participants on a time charter equivalent basis in accordance with an agreed-upon formula. The formulas in the pool agreements for allocating gross shipping revenues net of voyage expenses are based on points allocated to participants' vessels based on cargo carrying capacity and other technical characteristics, such as speed and fuel consumption. The selection of charterers, negotiation of rates and collection of related receivables and the payment of voyage expenses are the responsibility of the pools. The pools may enter into contracts that earn either voyage charter revenue or time charter revenue. Each of the pools follows the same revenue recognition principles, as applied by the Company, in determining shipping revenues and voyage expenses, including recognizing revenue only after a charter has been agreed to by both the pool and the customer, even if the vessel has discharged its cargo and is sailing to the anticipated load port on its next voyage.\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of (i) industry operations that have an impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations, (ii) the Company's financial condition at December 31, 2016 and 2015 and its results of operations comparing the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and (iii) critical accounting policies used in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements. All dollar amounts are presented in thousands, except daily dollar amounts and per share amounts.\nIncorporated in 1969, OSG has operated through multiple shipping cycles, making adjustments to our business as needed to compete and succeed. We provide safe, efficient and reliable transportation to customers and strive to ensure the highest standards of safety and environmental compliance throughout our organization.\n \nThe average monthly rate of production from the Eagle Ford formation decreased 410,000 b/d, or 28%, in December 2016 compared with December 2015. Eagle Ford crude is transported through pipeline infrastructure to Corpus Christi, where it is loaded on Jones Act vessels for transportation to refineries in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and the Philadelphia area. The reduction in production has led to the redeployment of a number of Jones Act vessels out of the crude trades into clean product trades, placing significant downward pressure on TCE rates. As of December 2016, 26% of the Jones Act tank vessel fleet deployment was in crude trades compared with 36% in December 2015. Jones Act tank vessel deployment in US Gulf clean product trades was 44% in December 2016 compared with 35% in December 2015. Adding to the impact of declining U.S. production was the lifting of the crude oil export ban on December 18, 2015.\n 42 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. \nAggregate Contractual Obligations\nEstimated outflows for operating expenses and drydocking requirements are based on historical and budgeted costs and are adjusted for assumed inflation. Finally, utilization is based on historical levels achieved and estimates of a residual value are consistent with the pattern of scrap rates used in management's evaluation of salvage value.\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations across our global operations. ASC 740 provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, on the basis of the technical merits of the position. ASC 740 also provides guidance on measurement, derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. We recognize tax liabilities and reductions in deferred tax assets in accordance with ASC 740 and we adjust these liabilities and deferred tax assets when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available.\n 38 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. \nWe generate significant cash flows from our complementary mix of time charters, voyage charters and contracts of affreightment. Net cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2016 was $328,860. In addition to operating cash flows, our other current sources of funds are proceeds from issuances of equity securities, additional borrowings as permitted under the Exit Financing Facilities and proceeds from the opportunistic sales of our vessels. In the past we have also obtained funds from the issuance of long-term debt securities. We may in the future complete transactions consistent with achieving the objectives of our business plan.\nManagement has designated cash reserves of $5,576 as of December 31, 2016 (compared with $10,583 at December 31, 2015) to be utilized within the next twelve months for the settlement of certain unsecured claims related to the Company's emergence from bankruptcy, $5 million of which was paid on February 27, 2017. The remainder of such restricted cash reserves will be used to settle claims or released in 2017. Additionally, restricted cash as of December 31, 2016 includes approximately $10,268 of legally restricted cash relating to the Unsecured Senior Notes, $1,696 of which is classified within current assets. The remaining $8,572 is included in non-current assets. The OBS Term Loan required that upon the spin-off of INSW the Company set aside in an escrow account (1) all accrued and unpaid interest on the existing Unsecured Senior Notes through the date of the consummation of the INSW spin-off and (2) all interest expense that will accrue under the respective existing Unsecured Senior Notes from the date of the consummation of the INSW spin-off through the maturity of the respective existing Unsecured Senior Notes.\nAccordingly, management recorded a charge in the fourth quarter of 2016, as part of income/(loss) from discontinued operations of $332,562 to reduce the carrying value of the disposal group to its estimated fair value, calculated on a held for sale basis. Management believes that it has identified and evaluated all long-lived assets within the disposal group for impairment in accordance with the guidance in ASC 845. Management also took into account the market capitalization of INSW following the spin on November 30, 2016 to assess and conclude on the reasonableness of the impairment charge related to the INSW disposal group, and considered the following factors: (i) INSW was a new public entity with little analyst coverage until January 2017; (ii) currently there is a lower level of liquidity for the INSW common stock since six shareholders hold approximately 60% of INSW's shares; (iii) the stock price as of February 27, 2017 was more than 25% higher than the closing price on the date of the spin off transaction; (iv) the shipping industry is highly cyclical and in periods of negative market sentiment, such as existed at the time of the spin off transaction and that currently persists, it is common for companies to trade at discounts to NAV.\nIn addition, during the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company decided to delay the disposal of one of its rebuilt ATBs from the estimated disposal date utilized in the September 30, 2016 impairment testing. This decision resulted in a change in the expected deployment of a second rebuilt ATB, which had been projected to assume the first ATB's time charter on January 1, 2017, and a decline in its forecasted cash flows. Accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $6,623 at December 31, 2016.\nSee Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to the Company's consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nResults from Vessel Operations\nThe duration of the benefit obligation at each of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was 11.26 years and 11.71 years, respectively.\nDuring 2015, income from vessel operations improved by $172,436 to $200,893 from $28,457 in 2014. This increase reflects the impact of a significant strengthening of TCE revenues, declining charter hire expense, and decreases in depreciation and amortization, severance and technical management transition costs and general and administrative expense. Such impacts were partially offset by a period-over-period increase in vessel expenses and a reduction in gains on vessel sales in the current year.\n 51 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. \nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement determined that the latter two factors had no impact on the carrying value INSW's fleet as of December 31, 2014. However, the decline in the third party valuation appraisals on four modern MRs, which were built between 2009 and 2011, was deemed to be an impairment indicator requiring the need to test the recoverability of the carrying value of these vessels. Based on tests performed, it was determined that the vessels would generate undiscounted cash flows in excess of their December 31, 2014 carrying values over the remainder of their useful lives.\n \nImpact of Spin off\nCarrying Value of Vessels\nIn accordance with the Separation and Distribution Agreement, subsequent to the November 30, 2016 spin-off of INSW, OSG will continue to guarantee debt and other obligations of certain of INSW's equity method investees. The debt and other obligations are primarily due to banks in connection with financing the purchase and conversion of vessels and equipment used in the joint venture operations. As of December 31, 2016, the maximum potential amount of future principal payments (undiscounted) that OSG could be required to make relating to such equity method investees secured bank debt and interest rate swaps was $38,789 and the carrying amount of the liability related to this guarantee was $0. In connection with the continuing OSG guarantees, INSW will pay a $125 fee per year to OSG, which is subject to escalation after 2017. INSW has indemnified OSG for liabilities arising from the continuing OSG guarantees pursuant to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement.\nINTEREST EXPENSE\nLiquidity\n \nRESULTS FROM VESSEL OPERATIONS\n*Including current portion.\n\nOn February 29, 2016, the Board declared a cash dividend of $0.08 per share on its Class A and Class B common stock. This dividend, totaling $30,573, was paid on March 25, 2016. The declaration and timing of future cash dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of the Board and will depend upon, among other things, our future operations and earnings, capital requirements, general financial condition, contractual restrictions and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant.\nSources, Uses and Management of Capital\nA summary of the Company's long-term contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 follows:\nThe carrying value of each of the Company's vessels represents its original cost at the time it was delivered or purchased less depreciation calculated using an estimated useful life of 25 years (except for new ATBs for which estimated useful lives of 30 years are used) from the date such vessel was originally delivered from the shipyard or 20 years from the date the Company's ATBs were rebuilt. A vessel's carrying value is reduced to its new cost basis (i.e. its current fair value) if a vessel impairment charge is recorded.\nThe United States has not adopted the Hong Kong International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships (the Convention\u201d). While the Convention is not in effect in the United States, the EPA and the Maritime Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation ( MarAd\u201d) have, from time to time, required the owners of U.S. Flag vessels to make certifications regarding the presence of certain toxic substances onboard vessels that they are seeking to sell to parties who (a) are not citizens of the United States and (b) intend to recycle the vessels after they have been purchased (the \"Recycling Purchasers\"). In the event that more stringent requirements are imposed upon the owners of U.S. Flag vessels seeking to sell their vessels to the Recycling Purchasers, such requirements could (a) negatively impact the sales prices obtainable from the Recycling Purchasers or (b) require companies, including OSG, to incur additional costs in order to sell their U.S. Flag vessels to the Recycling Purchasers or to other foreign buyers intending to use such vessels for further trading. Management currently believes that $300 per lightweight ton is a reasonable estimate of recycling prices for OSG's U.S. Flag vessels.\nDecember 31, 2015 Impairment evaluation - Management gave consideration as to whether any events and changes in circumstances existed as of December 31, 2015 that could be viewed as indicators that the carrying amounts of the vessels in the Company's International Flag fleet were not recoverable as of December 31, 2015 and determined there were no such events or changes in circumstances.\nRevenue Recognition\n 53 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. \nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $308,289, which are available to reduce future taxes, if any. The federal net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2034. The amount of net operating loss carryforwards reflected in this paragraph are presented on a tax return basis and differ from the amounts reflected in the balance sheet, which are reflected net of unrecognized tax benefits.\nIn estimating the fair value of vessels for the purposes of step 2 of the impairment tests, the Company utilizes estimates of discounted future cash flows for each of the vessels (income approach) since the secondhand sale and purchase market for the type of U.S. Flag vessels owned by OSG is not considered to be robust.\nIn determining the benefit obligations at the end of the year measurement date, the Company continues to use the equivalent single weighted-average discount rate, rounded to the nearest 5 basis points, that best matches projected benefit payments. During 2016, the Company changed its actuarial service provider and, therefore, for December 31, 2016, the Company based the discount rate on such actuary's proprietary index, which was calculated based on a universe of approximately 500 Aa-graded non-callable bonds. This rate was 3.95% as of December 31, 2016. For at least the two prior years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Company used the Citigroup Above Median Pension Discount Curve applied to the future payouts under the Maritrans Plan. The rates were 4.00% and 3.75% at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Although the December 31, 2016 index was different from that used in prior years, management believes that the current results are consistent with those that would have been produced had the Company continued to use the Citigroup Above Median Pension Discount Curve as it did in 2015 and 2014. The Company also assumed a long-term rate of return on the Maritrans Plan assets of 7.25% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, based on the asset mix as of such dates and management's estimate of the long term rate of return that could be achieved over the remaining duration of the Maritrans Plan. Based on the current asset mix, management believes the probability of achieving a long-term return of 7.25% over the remaining duration of the Maritrans Plan is more likely than not.\nThe Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, which could impact its results of operations and financial condition. The Company manages this exposure to market risk through its regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. To manage its interest rate risk in a cost-effective manner, the Company, from time-to-time, enters into interest rate swap or cap agreements, in which it agrees to exchange various combinations of fixed and variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts or to receive payments if floating interest rates rise above a specified cap rate. The Company uses such derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes. In addition, derivative financial instruments are entered into with a diversified group of major financial institutions in order to manage exposure to nonperformance on such instruments by the counterparties.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company had a secured term loan (OBS Term Loan) and a revolving credit facility (OBS ABL Facility) under which borrowings bear interest at a rate based on LIBOR, plus the applicable margin, as stated in the respective loan agreements. There were no amounts outstanding under the OBS ABL Facility as of December 31, 2016.\n 46 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. \nThe Company generates a portion of its revenue from voyage charters. Within the shipping industry, there are two methods used to account for voyage charter revenue: (1) ratably over the estimated length of each voyage and (2) completed voyage. The recognition of voyage revenues ratably over the estimated length of each voyage is the most prevalent method of accounting for voyage revenues in the shipping industry and the method used by OSG. Under each method, voyages may be calculated on either a load-to-load or discharge-to-discharge basis. In applying its revenue recognition method, management believes that the discharge-to-discharge basis of calculating voyages more accurately estimates voyage results than the load-to-load basis. Since, at the time of discharge, management generally knows the next load port and expected discharge port, the discharge-to-discharge calculation of voyage revenues can be estimated with a greater degree of accuracy. OSG does not begin recognizing voyage revenue until a charter has been agreed to by both the Company and the customer, even if the vessel has discharged its cargo and is sailing to the anticipated load port on its next voyage, because it is at this time the charter rate is determinable for the specified load and discharge ports and collectability is reasonably assured.\n \nThe increase in 2015 vessel expenses resulted primarily from (i) reactivation and operating costs incurred in conjunction with the Company's ULCC being taken out of lay-up in the first quarter of 2015 and commencing a time charter in April 2015, (ii) incremental costs relating to the redelivery of one of the Company's Panamaxes that had previously been bareboat chartered-out, (iii) the recording of a $1,450 reserve in 2015 for an assessment by a multi-employer defined benefit pension plan covering British crew members that served onboard INSW vessels (as well as vessels of other owners) more than 20 years ago, (iv) the Company taking delivery of a newbuild LR2 in the second quarter of 2014, and (v) technical management fees paid to V.Ships. The Company began transferring management of its International Flag conventional tankers to V.Ships in March 2014 and completed the transfers by September of 2014. Vessel operating expenses in 2015 included approximately $7,200 in technical management fees, compared with approximately $4,100 in 2014. These increases in vessel expense were more than offset by a decrease in the cost of providing technical and commercial management by the Company's shore-based staff that were previously included in general and administrative expenses.\nThe following table presents information about the Company's financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt obligations, the table presents the principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates of the Company's debt obligations.\nThe decrease in charter hire expense in 2015 compared with 2014 was principally the result of the redeliveries of ten vessels (eight Aframaxes, one Suezmax and one MR) at the expiry of their short-term time charters in 2014. Also contributing to the decrease was the redelivery of one additional MR upon its time charter's expiration in March 2015.\nOur current uses of funds are to fund working capital requirements, maintain the quality of our vessels, comply with U.S. and international shipping standards and environmental laws and regulations, repay or repurchase our outstanding loan facilities and to repurchase our common stock from time to time. The OBS Term Loan Facility requires that a portion of Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the term loan agreement) be used to prepay the outstanding principal balance of the term loan, commencing with the annual period beginning January 1, 2015. Management determined that no incremental prepayments will be required for the OBS Term Loan Facility for 2017 as the voluntary prepayment made during the fourth quarter of 2016 exceeded any prepayments which would have been required under the OBS Term Loan Facility for 2017. To the extent permitted under the terms of the OBS Term Loan, we may also use cash generated by operations to finance capital expenditures to modernize and grow our fleet.\n \nIntangible Asset\nThe spin-off was completed pursuant to a Separation and Distribution Agreement and several other agreements with OSG related to the spin-off, including a Transition Services Agreement and an Employee Matters Agreement. These agreements govern the relationship between us and OSG following the spin-off and provide for the allocation of various assets, liabilities, rights and obligations. These agreements also include arrangements for transition services to be provided by OSG to INSW and by INSW to OSG.\n \nTwelve of the Company's owned vessels are pledged as collateral under the Exit Financing Facilities. The carrying value of each of the Company's vessels does not necessarily represent its fair market value or the amount that could be obtained if the vessel were sold.\n (c) Ship-operating days represent calendar days \nEffective as of 5:00 p.m., New York time, on November 30, 2016 (the Distribution Date\u201d), OSG completed the separation of its business into two independent publicly-traded companies through the spin-off of INSW. The spin-off separates OSG and INSW into two distinct business with separate management. OSG has retained the U.S. Flag business and INSW holds entities and other assets and liabilities that formed OSG's former International Flag business.\n 44 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. \nAs of December 31, 2016, we had total liquidity on a consolidated basis of $281,933, comprised of $206,933 of cash (including $15,844 of restricted cash) and $75,000 of undrawn revolver capacity. We manage our cash in accordance with our intercompany cash management system subject to the requirements of our Exit Financing Facilities. Our cash and cash equivalents, as well as our restricted cash balances, generally exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limits. We place our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in what we believe to be credit-worthy financial institutions. In addition, certain of our money market accounts invest in U.S. Treasury securities or other obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, or its agencies.\nVessel Impairment\nThe Parent Company's ability to receive cash dividends, loans or advances from OBS is restricted under its loan facility. The Available Amount for cash dividends, loans or advances to the Parent Company permitted under the OBS Term Loan was $0 as of December 31, 2016, after OBS's dividend distributions to the Parent Company of $51,295 during 2016. Management expects that the Available Amount will increase to $93,592 by the end of the first quarter of 2017, after the required reports are filed with the banks.\n (b) Revenue days represent ship-operating days less days that vessels were not available for employment due to repairs, drydock or lay-up. \nDecember 31, 2014 Impairment evaluation - Management gave consideration to the following events and changes in circumstances in determining whether there were any indicators that the carrying amounts of the vessels in INSW's fleet were not recoverable as of December 31, 2014:\nThe following is a discussion of the results from vessel operations of the INSW discontinued operations for the eleven months ended November 30, 2016, and for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nThe components of interest expense are as follows:\nHistorically, we have also used funds to pay dividends and to repurchase our common stock from time to time. Pursuant to the October 2015 Board resolution authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $200,000 worth of the Company's Class A and Class B common stock and warrants, we repurchased 106,350 shares of Class A common stock at an aggregate cost of $1,301. In addition, during 2016, we repurchased 55,306,351 Class A warrants at an aggregate cost of $118,041.\nIn estimating the fair value of vessels for the purposes of step 2 of the impairment tests, the Company utilizes a market approach by using third party appraisals for the vessels in the INSW fleet.\n \n \n\nThe carrying values of the Company's vessels may not represent their fair market value or the amount that could be obtained by selling the vessel at any point in time since the market prices of second-hand vessels tend to fluctuate with changes in charter rates and the cost of newbuildings. Historically, both charter rates and vessel values tend to be cyclical. Management evaluates the carrying amounts of vessels held and used by the Company for impairment only when it determines that it will sell a vessel or when events or changes in circumstances occur that cause management to believe that future cash flows for any individual vessel will be less than its carrying value. In such instances, an impairment charge would be recognized if the estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the vessel and its eventual disposition is less than the vessel's carrying amount. This assessment is made at the individual vessel level as separately identifiable cash flow information for each vessel is available.\nReconciliations of time charter equivalent revenues to shipping revenues as reported in the consolidated statements of operations follows:\nIn connection with the acquisition of Maritrans in November 2006, the Company assumed the obligations under the noncontributory defined benefit pension plan that covered eligible employees of Maritrans ( the Maritrans Plan\u201d). The Company froze the benefits payable under the Maritrans Plan as of December 31, 2006. The Company has recorded pension benefit costs based on complex valuations developed by its actuarial consultants. These valuations are based on estimates and key assumptions, including those related to the discount rates, the rates expected to be earned on investments of plan assets and the life expectancy/mortality of plan participants. OSG is required to consider market conditions in selecting a discount rate that is representative of the rates of return currently available on high-quality fixed income investments. A higher discount rate would result in a lower benefit obligation and a lower rate would result in a higher benefit obligation. The expected rate of return on plan assets is management's best estimate of expected returns on plan assets. A decrease in the expected rate of return will increase net periodic benefit costs and an increase in the expected rate of return will decrease benefit costs. The mortality assumption is management's best estimate of the expected duration of future benefit payments at the measurement date. The estimate is based on the specific demographics and other relevant facts and circumstances of the Maritrans Plan and considers all relevant information available at the measurement date. Longer life expectancies would result in higher benefit obligations and a decrease in life expectancies would result in lower benefit obligations.\nFor the pools in which INSW participates, Company management monitored, among other things, the relative proportion of INSW's vessels operating in each of the pools to the total number of vessels in each of the respective pools, and assesses whether or not INSW's participation interest in each of the pools is sufficiently significant so as to determine that INSW has effective control of the pool. Company management determined that as of June 30, 2013, it had effective control of one of the pools in which INSW participated. Such pool was not a legal entity but operated under a contractual agreement. Therefore, effective July 1, 2013 through June 30, 2014, when INSW's participation in this pool ended, INSW's allocated TCE revenues for such pool were reported on a gross basis as voyage charter revenues and voyage expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. The impact of this method of presenting earnings for this pool was an increase in both voyage charter revenues and voyage expenses of $40,454 for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nThe Company's revenues are highly sensitive to patterns of supply and demand for vessels of the size and design configurations owned and operated by the Company and the trades in which those vessels operate. Rates for the transportation of crude oil and refined petroleum products are determined by market forces such as the supply and demand for oil. The demand for oil shipments is significantly affected by the state of the global economy, level of OPEC exports and oil production in the United States. The number of vessels is affected by newbuilding deliveries and by the removal of existing vessels from service, principally because of storage, scrappings or conversions. The Company's revenues are also affected by the mix of charters between spot (Voyage Charter) and long-term (Time or Bareboat Charter). Because shipping revenues and voyage expenses are significantly affected by the mix between voyage charters and time charters, the Company manages its vessels based on TCE revenues. Management makes economic decisions based on anticipated TCE rates and evaluates financial performance based on TCE rates achieved.\n\nPension Benefits\nAs discussed in Note 5, Discontinued Operations,\u201d to the Company's consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d the accounting for the distribution of nonmonetary assets to owners of an entity in a spinoff should be based on the recorded amount (after reduction, if appropriate, for an indicated impairment of value). The nonmonetary distribution of the assets of INSW constituted the disposal of a business. Accordingly, OSG's distribution of the shares of INSW to its shareholders on November 30, 2016 was recorded based on the carrying value of the INSW disposal group, after reduction for $332,562 in net impairment charges recognized for the excess of the carrying value of the INSW disposal group over its fair value, calculated on a held for sale basis. Such impairment charges are included in the results from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2016. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies - Vessel and Investment in Joint Venture Impairments - Held for Sale Basis (Disposal Group) below for additional information on management's judgments and estimates in determining the impairment charge for the INSW disposal group.\nCompany management estimated the scrap value of INSW's vessels to be $300 per lightweight ton. The assumptions used in the determination of estimated salvage value took into account current scrap prices, the historic pattern of annual average scrap rates over the four year and eleven-month period ended November 30, 2016, which ranged from $280 to $480 per lightweight ton, estimated changes in future market demand for scrap steel and estimated future demand for vessels. Scrap prices also fluctuate depending upon type of ship, bunkers on board, spares on board and delivery range.", "item_7_tables": "Table 229: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td>

2016. INSW is now an independent public company and its assets, liabilities and results are reported as discontinued operations. \n\n- OSG's continuing operations consist of its U.S. Flag business comprised of Jones Act vessels. Revenues decreased slightly in 2016 due to weakening rates in the Jones Act market.\n\n- Impairment charges of $332 million were recorded in 2016 to reduce the carrying value of the INSW disposal group to fair value. Additional impairments of $49 million were recorded on certain U.S. Flag vessels.\n\n- Interest expense decreased in 2016 due to debt repurchases made during the year. Net loss from continuing operations was $1 million in 2016 compared to net income of $81 million in 2015.\n\n- Liquidity remains strong with cash of $207 million and $75 million of undrawn revolver capacity at December 31, 2016. Debt repayments and refinancing plans are progressing.\n\n- Critical accounting policies and estimates relate to revenue recognition, impairment assessments, pension benefits, income taxes, and valuation of assets and liabilities of spun-off INSW business.\n\nIn summary, the spinoff of INSW is complete, OSG continues to focus on its U.S. Flag business, and maintains a solid financial position and liquidity. Impairment charges impacted results in 2016 but core operations remain stable."}
