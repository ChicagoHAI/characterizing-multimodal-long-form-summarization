MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements, related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d).\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which are not statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events or our future financial or operating performance. Words such as anticipate,\u201d believe,\u201d estimate,\u201d expect,\u201d \"will,\" intend,\u201d may,\u201d plan,\u201d seek\u201d and similar terms and phrases, or the negative thereof, may be used to identify forward-looking statements.\nThe forward-looking statements contained in this report are based on management's good-faith belief and reasonable judgment based on current information. The forward-looking statements are qualified by important factors, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including those described above in Item 1A Risk Factors and subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the SEC. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this report speaks only as of the date hereof or as of the date specified herein. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by any applicable laws or regulations.\nRecent Developments\nCOVID-19 (the Pandemic\u201d) is causing significant disruption to public health, the global economy, financial markets, and commercial, social and community activity generally. Our exposure to the Pandemic is manifold. The majority of our employees are now working remotely in observance of shelter-in-place\u201d or stay-at-home\u201d government orders. A significant portion of our revenues are generated from the hospitality sector of the U.S. economy, which has seen unprecedented contraction, at least in the near term, in an effort to mitigate the effects of the Pandemic. We have continued to provide customer service, process new and renewal business, handle claims and otherwise manage all operations even though the vast majority of the staff is working remotely. At this time, however, we are not able to provide additional forward-looking guidance as there is significant uncertainty regarding the ultimate impact of the Pandemic.\nBusiness Overview\nWe are an insurance holding company that markets and services our product offerings through specialty commercial and specialty personal insurance business lines. Our growth has been significant since our founding in 2009. Currently, we are authorized to write insurance as an excess and surplus lines carrier in 45 states, including the District of Columbia. We are licensed to write insurance as an admitted carrier in 42 states, including the District of Columbia, and we offer our insurance products in all 50 states.\nOur revenues are primarily derived from premiums earned from our insurance operations. We also generate other revenues through investment income and other income which mainly consists of: installment fees and policy issuance fees generally related to the policies we write.\nOur expenses consist primarily of losses and loss adjustment expenses, agents' commissions, and other underwriting and administrative expenses. We organize our operations in three insurance businesses: commercial insurance lines, personal lines, and agency business. Together, the commercial and personal lines refer to underwriting\u201d operations that take insurance risk, and the agency business refers to non-risk insurance business.\nThrough our commercial insurance lines, we offer coverage for both commercial property and commercial liability. We also offer coverage for commercial automobiles and workers' compensation. Our insurance policies are sold to targeted small and mid-sized businesses on a single or multiple-coverage basis.\nThrough our personal insurance lines, we offer homeowners insurance and dwelling fire insurance products to individuals in several states. Our specialty homeowners insurance product line is primarily comprised of low-value dwelling\ninsurance tailored for owners of lower valued homes, which we offer in Illinois, Indiana and Texas. Due to ongoing Florida-based industry events, we have been de-emphasizing our Florida homeowners' business and reducing our exposures in that state, as well as other wind-exposed states like Texas and Hawaii.\nThrough our wholesale agency business segment, we offer commercial and personal lines insurance products for our Insurance Company Subsidiaries as well as third-party insurers. We have expanded the wholesale agency business to develop more non-risk revenue streams, and to provide our agents with more insurance product options.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGeneral\nWe identified the accounting estimates below as critical to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations. Critical accounting estimates are defined as those estimates that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and which require us to exercise significant judgment. We use significant judgment concerning future results and developments in applying these critical accounting estimates and in preparing our consolidated financial statements. These judgments and estimates affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of material contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ materially from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates regularly using information that we believe to be relevant. See the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 ~ Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for further details.\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves\nOur recorded loss and loss adjustment expenses (\"LAE\") reserves represent management's best estimate of unpaid loss and LAE at each balance sheet date, based on information, facts and circumstances known at such time. Our loss and LAE reserves reflect our estimates at the balance sheet date of:\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Case reserves, which are unpaid loss and LAE amounts that have been reported; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Incurred but not reported (\"IBNR\") reserves, which are (1) unpaid loss and LAE amounts that have been incurred but not yet reported; and (2) the expected development on case reserves.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe do not discount the loss and LAE reserves for the time value of money.\nCase reserves are initially set by our claims personnel. When a claim is reported to us, our claims department completes a case-basis valuation and establishes a case reserve for the estimated amount of the probable ultimate losses and LAE associated with that claim. Our claims department updates their case-basis valuations upon receipt of additional information and reduces case reserves as claims are paid. The case reserve is based primarily upon an evaluation of the following factors:\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The type of loss;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The severity of injury or damage;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Our knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the claim;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The jurisdiction of the occurrence;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Policy provisions related to the claim;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Expenses intended to cover the ultimate cost of settling claims, including investigation and defense of lawsuits resulting from such claims, costs of outside adjusters and experts, and all other expenses which are identified to the case; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Any other information considered pertinent to estimating the indemnity and expense exposure presented by the claim.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIBNR reserves are determined by subtracting case reserves and paid loss and LAE from the estimated ultimate loss and LAE. Our actuarial department develops estimated ultimate loss and LAE on a quarterly basis. Our Reserve Review\nCommittee (which includes our Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer, other members of executive management, and key actuarial, underwriting and claims personnel) meets each quarter to review our actuaries' estimated ultimate expected loss and LAE.\nWe use several generally accepted actuarial methods to develop estimated ultimate loss and LAE estimates by line of business and accident year. This process relies on the basic assumption that past experience, adjusted for the effects of current developments and likely trends, is a reasonable basis for predicting future outcomes. These methods utilize various inputs, including:\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Written and earned premiums;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Paid and reported losses and LAE;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Expected initial loss and LAE ratio, which is the ratio of incurred losses and LAE to earned premiums; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Expected claim reporting and payout patterns based on our own loss experience and supplemented with insurance industry data where applicable.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe principal standard actuarial methods used by our actuaries for their comprehensive reviews include:\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Loss ratio method-This method uses loss and LAE ratios for prior accident years, adjusted for current trends, to determine an appropriate expected loss and LAE ratio for a given accident year;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Loss development methods-Loss development methods assume that the losses and LAE yet to emerge for an accident year are proportional to the paid or reported loss and LAE amounts observed to-date. The paid loss development method uses losses and LAE paid to date, while the reported loss development method uses losses and LAE reported to date;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Bornheutter-Ferguson method-This method is a combination of the loss ratio and loss development methods, where the loss development factor is given more weight as an accident year matures; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Frequency/severity method-This method projects claim counts and average cost per claim on a paid or reported basis for high frequency, low severity products.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur actuaries give different weights to each of these methods based upon the amount of historical experience data by line of business and by accident year, and based on judgment as to what method is believed to result in the most accurate estimate. The application of each method by line of business and by accident year may change in the future if it is determined that a different emphasis for each method would result in more accurate estimates.\nOur actuaries also analyze several diagnostic measures by line of business and accident year, including but not limited to: reported and closed frequency and severity, claim reporting and claim closing patterns, paid and incurred loss ratio development, and ratios of paid loss and LAE to incurred loss and LAE. After the actuarial methods and diagnostic measures have been performed and analyzed, our actuaries use their judgment and expertise to select an estimated ultimate loss and LAE by line of business and by accident year.\nOur actuaries estimate an IBNR reserve for our unallocated LAE not specifically identified to a particular claim, namely our internal claims department salaries and associated general overhead and administrative expenses associated with the adjustment and processing of claims. These estimates, which are referred to as unallocated loss adjustment expense (\"ULAE\") reserves, are based on internal cost studies and analyses reflecting the relationship of ULAE paid to actual paid and incurred losses. We select factors that are applied to case reserves and IBNR reserve estimates in order to estimate the amount of ULAE reserves applicable to estimated loss reserves at the balance sheet date.\nWe allocate the applicable portion of our estimated loss and LAE reserves to amounts recoverable from reinsurers under reinsurance contracts and report those amounts separately from our loss and LAE reserves as an asset on our balance sheet.\nThe estimation of ultimate liability for losses and LAE is a complex, imprecise and inherently uncertain process, and therefore involves a considerable degree of judgment and expertise. Our loss and LAE reserves do not represent an exact measurement of liability, but are estimates based upon various factors, including but not limited to:\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Actuarial projections of what we, at a given time, expect to be the cost of the ultimate settlement and administration of claims reflecting facts and circumstances then known;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Assessment of asserted theories of liability; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Analysis of other factors, such as variables in claims handling procedures, economic factors, and judicial and legislative trends and actions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMost or all of these factors are not directly or precisely quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis, and are subject to a significant degree of variability over time. In addition, the establishment of loss and LAE reserves makes no provision for the broadening of coverage by legislative action or judicial interpretation or for the extraordinary future emergence of new types of losses not sufficiently represented in our historical experience or which cannot yet be quantified. As a result, an integral component of our loss and LAE reserving process is the use of informed subjective estimates and judgments about our ultimate exposure to losses and LAE. Accordingly, the ultimate liability may vary significantly from the current estimate. The effects of change in the estimated loss and LAE reserves are included in the results of operations in the period in which the estimate is revised.\nOur reserves consist entirely of reserves for property and liability losses, consistent with the coverages provided for in the insurance policies directly written or assumed by us under reinsurance contracts. Several years may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to us and our payment of the loss. The level of IBNR reserves in relation to total reserves depends upon the characteristics of the specific line of business, particularly related to the speed with which claims are reported and outstanding claims are paid. Lines of business for which claims are reported slowly will have a higher percentage of IBNR reserves than lines of business that report and settle claims more quickly.\nThe following table shows the ratio of IBNR reserves to total reserves net of reinsurance recoverables as of December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td> Line of Business\n</td> <td> Case\nReserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> IBNR\nReserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\nReserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Ratio of\nIBNR to\nTotal\nReserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial Lines\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 84,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personal Lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Lines\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 87,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAlthough we believe that our reserve estimates are reasonable, it is possible that our actual loss and LAE experience may not conform to our assumptions and may, in fact, vary significantly from our assumptions. Accordingly, the ultimate settlement of losses and the related LAE may vary significantly from the estimates included in our financial statements. We continually review our estimates and adjust them as we believe appropriate as our experience develops or new information becomes known to us. Such adjustments are included in current operations.\nOur loss and LAE reserves do not represent an exact measurement of liability, but are estimates. The most significant assumptions affecting our IBNR reserve estimates are the loss development factors applied to paid losses and case reserves to develop IBNR by line of business and accident year. Although historical loss development provides us with an indication of future loss development, it typically varies from year to year. Thus, for each accident year within each line of business we select one loss development factor out of a range of historical factors.\nWe generated a sensitivity analysis of our net reserves which represents reasonably likely levels of variability in our selected loss development factors. We believe the most meaningful approach to the sensitivity analysis is to vary the loss development factors that drive the ultimate loss and LAE estimates. We applied this approach on an accident year basis, reflecting the reasonably likely differences in variability by level of maturity of the underlying loss experience for each accident year. Generally, the most recent accident years are characterized by more unreported losses and less information available for settling claims, and have more inherent uncertainty than the reserve estimates for more mature accident years. Therefore, we used variability factors of plus or minus 10% for the most recent accident year, 5% for the preceding accident year, and 2.5% for the second preceding accident year. There is minimal expected variability for accident years at four or more years' maturity.\nThe following table displays ultimate net loss and LAE and net loss and LAE reserves by accident year for the year ended December 31, 2020. We applied the sensitivity factors to each accident year amount and have calculated the amount of potential net loss and LAE reserve change and the impact on 2020 reported pre-tax income and on net income and shareholders' equity at December 31, 2020. We believe it is not appropriate to sum the illustrated amounts as it is not reasonably likely that each accident year's reserve estimate assumptions will vary simultaneously in the same direction to the full extent of the sensitivity factor. We also believe that such changes to our reserve balance would not have a material impact on our operating results, financial position, or liquidity. The net income and shareholders' equity amounts include an income tax rate assumption of 21%. The dollar amounts in the table are in thousands.\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Potential\nImpact on\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Ultimate\nLoss and\nLAE\nSensitivity\nFactor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Ultimate\nLoss and\nLAE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Loss and\nLAE\nReserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Pre-\nTax Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Shareholders'\nEquity\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increased Ultimate Losses & LAE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accident Year 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accident Year 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accident Year 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Prior to 2018 Accident Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Decreased Ultimate Losses & LAE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accident Year 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,062\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,209\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accident Year 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,463\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,946\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accident Year 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,517\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,198\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Prior to 2018 Accident Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment Valuation and Impairment\nWe carry debt securities classified as available-for-sale at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses on such securities, net of any deferred taxes, are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Our equity securities that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method are measured at fair value and any changes in fair value are recognized in net income. We carry other equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value at cost, less impairment and adjusted for observable price changes under the measurement alternative provided under GAAP. We review these investments for impairment during each reporting period. We do not have any securities classified as trading or held-to-maturity.\nWe evaluate our available-for-sale investments regularly to determine whether there have been declines in value that are other-than-temporary. Our outside investment managers assist us in this evaluation. When we determine that a security has experienced an other-than-temporary impairment, the impairment loss is recognized as a realized investment loss.\nWe consider a number of factors in assessing whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, including (1) the amount and percentage that current fair value is below cost or amortized cost, (2) the length of time that the fair value has been below cost or amortized cost and (3) recent corporate developments or other factors that may impact an issuer's near term prospects. In addition, for debt securities, we consider the credit quality ratings for the securities, with a special emphasis on securities downgraded to below investment grade. We also consider our intent to sell available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, and if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before a recovery in fair value to their cost or amortized cost basis.\nFair values are measured in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements. The guidance establishes a framework for measuring fair value and a three-level hierarchy based upon the quality of inputs used to measure fair value. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are: (1) Level 1: inputs are based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, (2) Level 2: inputs are other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liabilities, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability and (3) Level 3: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity. The unobservable inputs represent the Company's best assumption of how market participants would price the assets or liabilities. The Company also has investment company limited partnership investments, which are measured at net asset value (NAV). The fair value of these investments is based on the capital account balances reported by the investment funds subject to their management review and adjustment. The capital account balances reflect the fair value of the investment funds.\nThe fair values of debt and equity securities have been determined using fair value prices provided by our investment managers, who utilize internationally recognized independent pricing services. The prices provided by the independent pricing services are generally based on observable market data in active markets (e.g., broker quotes and prices observed for comparable securities).\nThe values for publicly-traded equity securities are generally based on Level 1 inputs which use the market approach valuation technique. The values for debt securities generally incorporate significant Level 2 inputs. The carrying value of cash and short-term investments approximate their fair values due to their short-term maturity.\nWe review fair value prices provided by our outside investment managers for reasonableness by comparing the fair values provided by the managers to those provided by our investment custodian. We also review and monitor changes in unrealized gains and losses. We obtain an understanding of the methods, models and inputs used by our investment managers and independent pricing services, and controls are in place to validate that prices provided represent fair values. Our control process includes initial and ongoing evaluation of the methodologies used, a review of specific securities and an assessment for proper classification within the fair value hierarchy.\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous state jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the consolidated income tax expense.\nIn 2018, the Company recognized a measurement period adjustment of $42,735 related to loss reserve discounting, which reduced deferred tax expense. The Company also recognized a measurement period adjustment of $42,735 related to the loss reserve discounting transitional adjustment, which increased deferred tax expense. The measurement period adjustments were based upon obtaining additional information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the enactment date that, if known, would have affected the income tax effects initially reported as provisional amounts under the Act. The measurement period adjustments had no effect on the effective tax rate for the year ending December 31, 2018. The accounting for the income tax effects of the Act pursuant to SAB 118 has been completed as of the end of the December 22, 2018, measurement period and for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nDeferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state and federal pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. The assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income or loss.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have federal and state income tax net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) carryforwards of $59.2 million and $17.1 million, respectively. Of the NOL carryforwards, $49.3 million will expire in tax years 2028 through 2039 and $9.9 million will never expire. Of the federal NOL amount, $14.1 million are subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. These net NOL carryforwards are limited in the amount that can be utilized in any one year and may expire before they are realized. At this time we do not expect that any of the remaining NOL carryforwards will expire before utilized.\nThe carrying value of our gross deferred tax asset for the NOL carryforwards is equal to the total NOL carryforward amount times the applicable federal and state tax rates, and was $13.3 million and $13.5 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Total gross deferred tax assets were $17.2 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. A valuation allowance of $13.3 million and $13.6 million has been recorded against the gross deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as the Company has recognized a three-year cumulative loss as of December 31, 2020 which is significant negative evidence to support the lack of recoverability of those deferred tax assets in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. If the $13.3 million valuation allowance as of December 31, 2020 were reversed in the future, it would increase book value by $1.37 per share. The net deferred tax liabilities were zero as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nIf, in the future, we determine we can support the recoverability of a portion or all of the deferred tax assets under the guidance, the tax benefits relating to any reversal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets will be accounted for as a reduction of income tax expense and result in an increase in equity. Changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities and our effective tax rate in the future.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted Operating Income (Loss) and Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) Per Share\nAdjusted operating income (loss) and adjusted operating income (loss) per share are non-GAAP measures that represent net income allocable to common shareholders excluding net realized investment and other gains (losses), net of tax, the effects of tax reform, the tax effect of changes in unrealized gains to the extent included in net income, the change in the fair value of equity securities, net of tax, and the capitalization and amortization of deferred gains from the ADC. The most directly comparable financial GAAP measures to adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share are net income and net income per share, respectively. Adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share are intended as supplemental information and are not meant to replace net income or net income per share. Adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial results. Our definition of adjusted operating income may be different from that used by other companies. The following is a reconciliation of net income to adjusted operating income (dollars in thousands), as well as net income per share to adjusted operating income per share:\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (7,822\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (9,227\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized investment gains and other gains, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tax effect of unrealized gains and losses on investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in fair value of equity securities, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (427\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (increase) decrease in deferred gain on losses ceded to ADC, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,677\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (8,019\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (15,092\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,732\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average common shares, diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,625,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,880,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,543,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted income (loss) per common share:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.06\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.88\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1.08\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized investment gains and other gains, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tax effect of unrealized gains and losses on investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in fair value of equity securities, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.05\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (increase) decrease in deferred gain on losses ceded to ADC, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.64\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.66\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted operating income (loss) per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.83\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1.69\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.44\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe use adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share, in conjunction with other financial measures, to assess our performance and to evaluate the results of our business. We believe these measures provide investors with valuable information relating to our ongoing performance that may be obscured by the effect of investment gains and losses as a result of our market risk sensitive instruments, which primarily relate to fixed income securities that are available-for-sale and not held for trading purposes. Realized investment gains and losses may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by external economic developments, such as capital market conditions. Accordingly, adjusted operating income excludes the effect of items that tend to be highly variable from period to period and highlights the results from our ongoing business operations and the underlying loss or profitability of our business. We believe that it is useful for investors to evaluate adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share, along with net income and net income per share, when reviewing and evaluating our performance.\nExecutive Overview\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we continued to see growth in our commercial and personal lines in areas where we have had the most success. Our commercial lines gross written premiums increased by $8.4 million, or 8.9%, to $102.8 million in 2020, compared to $94.4 million in 2019. Personal lines gross written premiums increased by $1.1 million, or 14.9% to $8.6 million in 2020, compared to $7.5 million in 2019.\nThe Company's commercial lines experienced low claims activity during 2020 due to COVID-19. While substantially all businesses maintained their insurance, liability losses were lower as restaurants, bars, and other small businesses were required to limit business or totally shut down for a period of time. This reduced the potential to incur liability losses and contributed to the lower current accident year loss ratio. Potential exposures to COVID-19 losses were minimal as we include strict exclusions to business interruption coverage related to bacterial or viral causes on most policies and require physical property damage for the business interruption coverage to be effective on all policies. We also do not provide coverage relating to event cancellations, travel insurance or other coverages that could directly generate such losses. We believe we also have limited exposures relating to our workers compensation coverages which are generally companion coverages with our existing commercial policies, which represents a small amount of our overall premiums and does not appear to be heavily exposed to COVID-19-related losses.\nThe Company reported net income of $595,000, or $0.06 per share, in 2020, compared to a net loss of $7.8 million, or $0.88 per share, in 2019.\nAdjusted operating loss, a non-GAAP measure, was $8.0 million, or $0.83 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to an adjusted operating loss of $15.1 million, or $1.69 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe 2020 results were mainly driven by net realized investment gains, and net investment income of $8.1 million and $3.2 million, respectively. The largest difference between net income and the adjusted operating loss is related to the $8.4 million of net realized investment gains, and other gains, net of tax.\nThe impact from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma continued to recede in 2020. Loss development on Hurricane Harvey was $89,000 in 2020 compared to $313,000 in 2019. Catastrophe reinstatement costs from Irma were $195,000 in 2020, compared to $495,000 in 2019.\nIn an effort to reduce interest costs, we restructured our debt during 2018 by issuing $25.3 million of public senior unsecured notes (the \"Notes\") and paid down $19.5 million of our subordinated notes to $10.5 million.\nResults of Operations - 2020 Compared to 2019\nThe following table summarizes our

The increase was primarily due to the growth experienced in the commercial lines business. However, increased reinsurance rates tempered the growth of gross written premiums.\nOther Income\nOther income consists primarily of fees charged to policyholders by the Company for services outside of the premium charge, such as installment billings or policy issuance costs. Commission income is also received by the Company's insurance agencies for writing policies for third party insurance companies. Other income increased by $506,000, or 24.0%, to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $2.1 million in 2019. The increase in other income was primarily due to commissions from the growing wholesale agency business as well as increased fees charged on existing business.\nLosses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nThe tables below detail our losses and LAE and loss ratios for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands).\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Commercial\nLines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Personal\nLines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accident year net losses and LAE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (favorable) adverse development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Calendar year net loss and LAE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 53,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 56,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accident year loss ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (favorable) adverse development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Calendar year loss ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 62.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Commercial\nLines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Personal\nLines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accident year net losses and LAE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 49,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (favorable) adverse development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Calendar year net loss and LAE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 53,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 59,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accident year loss ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (favorable) adverse development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Calendar year loss ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 120.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 66.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet losses and LAE decreased by $3.5 million, or 5.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019.

It is calculated by dividing the sum of policy acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses by the sum of net earned premiums and other income of the underwriting business. Costs that cannot be readily identifiable as a direct cost of a segment or product line remain in Corporate for segment reporting purposes. The expense ratio excludes wholesale agency and Corporate expenses.\nThe table below provides the expense ratio by major component:\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial Lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Policy acquisition costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personal Lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Policy acquisition costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Underwriting\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Policy acquisition costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur expense ratio increased by 1.6%, to 45.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019.\nPolicy acquisition costs are costs we incur to issue policies, which include commissions, premium taxes, underwriting reports and underwriter compensation costs. The Company offsets direct commissions with ceded commissions from reinsurers. The percentage of policy acquisition costs to net earned premiums and other income increased by 2.1%, from 28.2 in 2019 to 30.3% in 2020. The acquisition cost ratio was higher mostly due to higher ceded premium rates in 2020 compared to 2019.\nOperating expenses consist primarily of employee compensation, information technology and occupancy costs, such as rent and utilities. Operating expenses as a percent of net earned premiums and other income was 15.3% and 15.8% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The operating expense ratio was lower due to our expense reduction efforts, partially offset by higher ceded premium rates discussed above.\nUnderwriting Results\nWe measure the performance of our consolidated results, in part, based on our underwriting gain or loss.

This decrease was due to a decrease in interest income in our debt securities. This occurred because of the decreasing yields driven by the decrease in prevailing market interest rates. Average invested assets as of December 31, 2020 were $176.5 million compared to $154.9 million for the same period in 2019. The averaged invested asset balance was comprised 80.2% debt securities, 7.1% equity securities and 12.7% short-term investments as of December 31, 2020. The average invested asset balance was comprised of 81.1% debt securities, 5.8% equity securities and 13.1% short-term investments as of December 31, 2019.\nThe portfolio's average quality was AA+ and AA at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The portfolio produced a tax-equivalent book yield of 1.6% and 2.6% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The option adjusted duration of the debt securities portfolio was 3.6 years and 2.8 years at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe Company received a one-time dividend from an investment for $213,000 in the third quarter of 2019.\nRealized Investment Gains\nNet realized investment gains increased by $6.9 million, or 579%, to $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was attributed to the company harvesting gains from the increase in value of its bond portfolio in 2020. The Company also experienced gains in its equity securities with the market increasing in value during the second half of 2020. Some of these equity gains were realized upon sale.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. We issued $25.3 million of public senior unsecured notes (the \"Notes\") in 2018. Proceeds from the Notes were used to pay down $19.5 million of the $30.0 million of subordinated notes that were issued in the third quarter of 2017. The Company repurchased 36,761 units of the Notes in the public market in 2020. Interest expense includes the amortization of debt issuance costs relating to the Notes which is $260,000 per annum over the 5-year life of the Notes. The interest expense relating to the amortization of debt issuance costs for the existing $10.5 million of the subordinated notes is $51,000 per annum over the 20-year life of the subordinated notes.\nThe Company has a $10.0 million line of credit, which it drew upon and paid down at various times throughout 2020, and which contributed to interest expense.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company reported $6,000 of current federal income tax expense and $0 of current state income tax expense. The Company reported a deferred tax benefit of $0 and $940,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The deferred tax benefit in 2019 was a result of the change in the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to the changes in unrealized gains. No such impact occurred in 2020. The Company in 2020 had $808,000 of taxable income, which was fully offset by the utilization of the net operating losses carried forward from previous years.\nThere is a $13.3 million valuation allowance against 100% of the net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2020, which would increase book value by $1.37 per share if reversed in the future. The valuation allowance was $13.6 million as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of $59.2 million, of which $49.3 million expire in tax years 2028 through 2039 and $9.9 million never expire. Of this amount, $14.1 million are limited in the amount that can be utilized in any one year and may expire before they are realized under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company has state net operating loss carryforwards of $17.1 million, which expire in tax years 2021 through 2040.\nResults of Operations - 2019 Compared to 2018\nThe following table summarizes our

The decrease was attributable to a reduction in written premium in our hospitality programs, which was slightly offset by an increase in written premium in our small business programs.\nCommercial lines gross written premiums decreased $3.3 million, or 3.4%, to $94.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $97.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our hospitality programs' gross written premiums decreased $6.6 million, or 12.0%, to $48.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $55.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. However, gross written premiums for our small business programs increased by $3.3 million, or 7.7%, to $46.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $42.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nPersonal lines gross written premiums increased $788,000, or 11.8%, to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $6.7 million for the same period in 2018. This was largely driven by an increase in our low value dwelling business.\nNet written premiums decreased $1.4 million, or 1.5%, to $87.7 million, for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $89.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to the reduction in the commercial lines business.\nOther Income\nOther income consists primarily of fees charged to policyholders by the Company for services outside of the premium charge, such as installment billings or policy issuance costs. Commission income is also received by the Company's insurance agencies for writing policies for third party insurance companies. Other income increased by $527,000, or 33.3%, to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $1.6 million in 2018. The increase in other income was primarily due to additional commission income in the wholesale agency operations as well as increased fees charged on existing business.\nLosses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nThe tables below detail our losses and LAE and loss ratios for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in thousands).\nWe have changed the calculation to remove wholesale agency operations and corporate headquarters operations to provide a better measure of the underwriting operations' efficiency.

It is calculated by dividing the sum of policy acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses by the sum of net earned premiums and other income of the underwriting business. Costs that cannot be readily identifiable as a direct cost of a segment or product line remain in Corporate for segment reporting purposes. The expense ratio excludes wholesale agency and Corporate expenses. In prior periods the wholesale agency operations and Corporate expenses were included in the expense ratio calculation. We have changed the calculation to remove wholesale agency operations and Corporate expenses to provide a better measure of the underwriting operations' efficiency. The 2018 ratios have been recast to reflect the new presentation.

The decrease in the expense ratio was primarily due to lower operating and reinsurance costs in 2019 compared to 2018. The reduction in the expense ratio was partially offset by lower net earned premium in 2019 compared to 2018.\nPolicy acquisition costs are costs we incur to issue policies, which include commissions, premium taxes, underwriting reports and underwriter compensation costs. The Company offsets direct commissions with ceded commissions from reinsurers. The percentage of policy acquisition costs to net earned premiums and other income decreased by 1.0%, from 29.2% in 2018, to 28.2% in 2019.\nOperating expenses consist primarily of employee compensation, information technology and occupancy costs, such as rent and utilities. Operating expenses as a percent of net earned premiums and other income was 15.8% and 16.7% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nUnderwriting Results\nWe measure the performance of our consolidated results, in part, based on our underwriting gain or loss.

This increase was mainly due to an increase in average invested assets during 2019. Average invested assets as of December 31, 2019 were $154.9 million, compared to $148.9 million as of December 31, 2018, an increase of $6.0 million, or 4.0%. As of December 31, 2019, the average invested asset balance was comprised of 81.1% debt securities, 5.8% equity securities and 13.1% short-term investments, compared to the December 31, 2018 mix of 86.3% debt securities, 6.9% equity securities and 6.8% short term investments.\nThe portfolio's average quality was AA at December 31, 2019 and 2018. The portfolio produced a tax-equivalent book yield of 2.6% and 2.8% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The duration-to-worst average of the debt securities portfolio was 3.0 years and 3.1 years at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe Company received a one-time dividend from an investment for $213,000 in the third quarter of 2019.\nRealized Investment Gains\nNet realized investment gains increased by $1.1 million to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $61,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was mostly attributed to the increase in value of the Company's equity securities in 2019.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $2.9 million and $2.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We issued $25.3 million of Notes in 2018. Proceeds from the Notes were used to pay down $19.5 million of the $30.0 million of subordinated notes that were issued in the third quarter of 2017. Interest expense includes the amortization of debt issuance costs relating to the new Notes which is $260,000 per annum over the 5-year life of the Notes. The interest expense relating to the amortization of debt issuance costs for the existing $10.5 million of the subordinated notes is $50,000 per annum over the 20-year life of the subordinated notes.\nThe Company has a $10.0 million line of credit, which it drew upon and paid down at various times throughout 2019, and which contributed to interest expense.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company reported $0 of current federal income tax expense and $27,000 of current state income tax expense. The Company reported a deferred tax benefit of $940,000 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in the deferred tax benefit in 2019 was a result of the change in the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to the changes in unrealized gains.\nThere is a $13.6 million valuation allowance against 100% of the net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2019, which would increase book value by $1.41 per share if reversed in the future. The valuation allowance was $12.6 million as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of $60.0 million, of which $50.0 million expire in tax years 2020 through 2039 and $10.0 million never expire. Of this amount, $14.1 million are limited in the amount that can be utilized in any one year and may expire before they are realized under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company has state net operating loss carryforwards of $17.7 million, which expire in tax years 2021 through 2039.\nIn 2018, the Company recognized a measurement period adjustment of $42,735 related to loss reserve discounting, which reduced deferred tax expense. The Company also recognized a measurement period adjustment of $42,735 related to the loss reserve discounting transitional adjustment, which increased deferred tax expense. The measurement period adjustments were based upon obtaining additional information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the enactment date that, if known, would have affected the income tax effects initially reported as provisional amounts under the Act. The measurement period adjustments had no effect on the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018. The\naccounting for the income tax effects of the Act pursuant to SAB 118 has been completed as of the end of the December 22, 2018, measurement period and for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and Uses of Funds\nAt December 31, 2020, we had $21.5 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Our principal sources of funds are insurance premiums, investment income, proceeds from maturity and sale of invested assets and other income. These funds are primarily used to pay claims, commissions, employee compensation, taxes and other operating expenses, and service debt.\nWe believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and investment securities balances will be adequate to meet our capital and liquidity needs and the needs of our subsidiaries on a short-term and long-term basis.\nWe conduct our business operations primarily through our Insurance Company Subsidiaries. Our ability to service debt, and pay administrative expenses is primarily reliant upon our intercompany service fees paid by the Insurance Company Subsidiaries to the holding company for management, administrative, and information technology services provided to the Insurance Company Subsidiaries by the Parent Company. Secondarily, the Parent Company may receive dividends from the Insurance Company Subsidiaries; however, this is not the primary means in which the holding company supports its funding as state insurance laws restrict the ability of our Insurance Company Subsidiaries to declare dividends to the Parent Company. Generally, the limitations are based on the greater of statutory net income for the preceding year or 10% of statutory surplus at the end of the preceding year. No dividends were paid from our Insurance Company Subsidiaries in 2020, 2019 or 2018.\nWe contributed $1.2 million to our Insurance Company Subsidiaries in 2020. We contributed $3.9 million to our Insurance Company Subsidiaries in 2019. No contributions to our Insurance Company Subsidiaries were made in 2018. We believe that the current statutory surplus levels and the funds available at the holding company level will provide the necessary statutory capital to support our premium volume growth over the next two years.\nWe are aware that our outstanding debt securities are currently trading at a discount to their face amount. In order to reduce future cash interest payments, as well as future amounts due at maturity or upon redemption, we may, from time to time, purchase such debt for cash, in exchange for common stock, or for a combination of cash and common stock, in open market or privately negotiated transactions. We will evaluate any such transactions in light of then-existing market conditions, taking into account our current liquidity and prospects for future access to capital. The amounts involved in such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material.\nCash Flows\nOperating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $3.0 million, compared to $15.4 million for the same period in 2019. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a $6.0 million increase in paid claims, a decrease of $3.0 million of cash received from agencies, and a $2.1 million decrease in cash received under certain fronting arrangements. These reductions in cash flow provided by operating activities were partially offset by a $3.1 million increase in premiums collected, net of reinsurance premiums.\nCash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, was $15.4 million as compared to cash used in operating activities of $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $32.4 million increase in cash from operations was mostly due to a $28.4 million increase in cash received from reinsurers due to ceded losses, including $12.5 million of cash received in 2019 from the ADC. Also, ceded premiums paid to reinsurers decreased by $2.6 million in 2019 compared to 2018.\nInvesting Activities. Cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, was $7.3 million and $25.0 million, respectively. The $17.7M increase in the use of cash from investing activities over the prior year is due to increased activity across the Company's investment portfolio to take advantage of 2020 market conditions.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, was $25.0 million as compared to cash provided by investing activities of $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in funds used in investing activities was due to an increase in funds available to be invested in our investment portfolio in the insurance subsidiaries.\nFinancing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, was $5.1 million and $6.3 million, respectively. The decrease of $1.2 million in 2020 of cash provided by financing activities was due to no issuance of common stock in 2020, and $5.0 million issuance of common stock in 2019. This decrease was offset by an increase in borrowings from the Company's line of credit.\nCash provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, was $6.3 million and $3.7 million, respectively. The $2.6 million increase in 2019 compared to 2018 was largely due to a $5.0 million issuance of common stock in 2019, and no issuance of common stock in 2018.\nOutstanding Debt\nOn April 24, 2020, the Company received a $2.7 million PPP loan from the line of credit Lender pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program of the CARES Act administered by the SBA. The PPP loan was incorporated into the existing line of credit facility and utilizes a portion of the line of credit's limit. However, the PPP loan has a different maturity date (April 24, 2022) in accordance with the SBA requirements and bears interest at a rate of 1.0% per annum. The Company amended its $10.0 million line of credit facility with the Lender to incorporate this loan as a reduction of the available line of credit. The loan may be prepaid by the Company at any time prior to maturity with no prepayment penalties. This loan may be subject to forgiveness under the CARES Act provisions. The Company applied for forgiveness of the loan in 2020, at which point the principal and interest payments were deferred until the SBA remits the loan forgiveness amount to the Lender. No assumptions were made relative to potential forgiveness as of December 31, 2020.\nIn 2018, the Company issued $25.3 million of Notes. The Notes bear an interest rate of 6.75% annum, payable quarterly at the end of March, June, September and December and mature on September 30, 2023. Proceeds from the Notes were used to pay down $19.5 million of the $30.0 million of subordinated notes that were issued in the third quarter of 2017. The Company repurchased 36,761 units of the Notes in the public market during 2020 with a face value of $919,000. The Notes were repurchased at a discount to face value, which resulted in a $260,000 gain on extinguishment in 2020. This gain is reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as Other gains.\nThe Company also has outstanding $10.5 million of subordinated notes maturing on September 30, 2038. The subordinated notes bear an interest rate of 7.5% per annum until September 30, 2023, and 12.5% thereafter, and allow for four quarterly interest payment deferrals. Interest is payable quarterly at the end of March, June, September and December. Beginning September 30, 2021, the Company may redeem the subordinated notes, in whole or in part, for a call premium of $1.1 million. The call premium escalates each quarter to ultimately $1.75 million on September 30, 2023, then steps up to $3.05 million on December 31, 2023, and increases quarterly at a 12.5% per annum rate thereafter.\nThe carrying value of the Notes and subordinated notes are offset by $1.6 million of debt issuance costs that will be amortized through interest expense over the life of the loans. Refer to Note 7 ~ Debt of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding our outstanding debt.\nThe Company maintains a $10.0 million line of credit with a national bank (the Lender\u201d). The line of credit bears interest at the London Interbank rate (\"LIBOR\") plus 2.75% per annum, payable monthly. The agreement includes several financial debt covenants, including a minimum tangible net worth, a minimum fixed-charge coverage ratio, and minimum statutory risk-based capital levels. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $7.75 million outstanding on the line of credit (including the PPP loan described above), and was in compliance with all of its financial debt covenants. On June 19, 2020, the line of credit was renewed with a maturity of June 18, 2021.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table is a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\none year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> One to\nthree years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three to\nfive years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\nfive years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior unsecured notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on senior unsecured notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subordinated notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on subordinated notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Line of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss and loss adjustment expense (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 111,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase Obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 183,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 52,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 82,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> The estimated unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense payments were made using estimates based on historical payment patterns.

The formula measures required capital and surplus based on an insurance company's products and investment portfolio and is used as a tool to evaluate the capital adequacy of regulated companies. The RBC formula is used by state insurance regulators to monitor trends in statutory capital and surplus for the purpose of initiating regulatory action. In general, an insurance company must submit a calculation of its RBC formula to the insurance department of its state of domicile as of the end of the previous calendar year. These laws require increasing degrees of regulatory oversight and intervention as an insurance company's RBC declines.\nAt December 31, 2020, all of our Insurance Company Subsidiaries were in excess of any minimum threshold at which corrective action would be required.\nInsurance operations are subject to various leverage tests (e.g., premium-to-statutory surplus ratios), which are evaluated by regulators and rating agencies. As of December 31, 2020, on a trailing twelve-month statutory combined basis, the gross written and net written premium leverage ratios were 1.7 to 1.0 and 1.5 to 1.0, respectively.\nThe NAIC's Insurance Regulatory Information System ( IRIS\u201d) was developed to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states. IRIS identifies thirteen industry ratios and specifies usual values\u201d for each ratio. State insurance regulators review the IRIS ratio results to determine if an insurer is in need of further regulatory scrutiny or action. While the ratios, individually and collectively, are useful tools for identifying companies that may be experiencing financial difficulty, they are only a guide for regulators and should not be considered an absolute indicator of a Company's financial condition. While inquiries from regulators are not uncommon, our Insurance Company Subsidiaries have not experienced any regulatory actions due to their IRIS ratio results or otherwise.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 ~ Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: Recently Issued Accounting Guidance of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed information.", "item_7_truncated": "Financing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, was $5.1 million and $6.3 million, respectively. The decrease of $1.2 million in 2020 of cash provided by financing activities was due to no issuance of common stock in 2020, and $5.0 million issuance of common stock in 2019. This decrease was offset by an increase in borrowings from the Company's line of credit.\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td> Line of Business\n</td> <td> Case\nReserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> IBNR\nReserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\nReserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Ratio of\nIBNR to\nTotal\nReserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial Lines\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 84,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personal Lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Lines\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 87,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe portfolio's average quality was AA+ and AA at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Accordingly, the ultimate settlement of losses and the related LAE may vary significantly from the estimates included in our financial statements. We continually review our estimates and adjust them as we believe appropriate as our experience develops or new information becomes known to us. Such adjustments are included in current operations.\nInterest Expense\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial Lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Policy acquisition costs\n</td> <td> 28.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses\n</td> <td> 15.3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> 43.3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45.8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personal Lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Policy acquisition costs\n</td> <td> 32.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses\n</td> <td> 23.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> 55.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Underwriting\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Policy acquisition costs\n</td> <td> 28.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses\n</td> <td> 15.8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> 44.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2020, all of our Insurance Company Subsidiaries were in excess of any minimum threshold at which corrective action would be required.\nGeneral\nWe conduct our business operations primarily through our Insurance Company Subsidiaries. Our ability to service debt, and pay administrative expenses is primarily reliant upon our intercompany service fees paid by the Insurance Company Subsidiaries to the holding company for management, administrative, and information technology services provided to the Insurance Company Subsidiaries by the Parent Company. Secondarily, the Parent Company may receive dividends from the Insurance Company Subsidiaries; however, this is not the primary means in which the holding company supports its funding as state insurance laws restrict the ability of our Insurance Company Subsidiaries to declare dividends to the Parent Company. Generally, the limitations are based on the greater of statutory net income for the preceding year or 10% of statutory surplus at the end of the preceding year. No dividends were paid from our Insurance Company Subsidiaries in 2020, 2019 or 2018.\nPremiums\nNet losses and LAE decreased by $2.7 million, or 4.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018. The calendar year loss ratios were 66.8% and 66.4% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe identified the accounting estimates below as critical to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations. Critical accounting estimates are defined as those estimates that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and which require us to exercise significant judgment. We use significant judgment concerning future results and developments in applying these critical accounting estimates and in preparing our consolidated financial statements. These judgments and estimates affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of material contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ materially from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates regularly using information that we believe to be relevant. See the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 ~ Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for further details.\n \u2022 Policy provisions related to the claim; \nIBNR reserves are determined by subtracting case reserves and paid loss and LAE from the estimated ultimate loss and LAE.

The formula measures required capital and surplus based on an insurance company's products and investment portfolio and is used as a tool to evaluate the capital adequacy of regulated companies. The RBC formula is used by state insurance regulators to monitor trends in statutory capital and surplus for the purpose of initiating regulatory action. In general, an insurance company must submit a calculation of its RBC formula to the insurance department of its state of domicile as of the end of the previous calendar year. These laws require increasing degrees of regulatory oversight and intervention as an insurance company's RBC declines.\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td>

The Notes bear an interest rate of 6.75% annum, payable quarterly at the end of March, June, September and December and mature on September 30, 2023. Proceeds from the Notes were used to pay down $19.5 million of the $30.0 million of subordinated notes that were issued in the third quarter of 2017. The Company repurchased 36,761 units of the Notes in the public market during 2020 with a face value of $919,000. The Notes were repurchased at a discount to face value, which resulted in a $260,000 gain on extinguishment in 2020. This gain is reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as Other gains.\nBusiness Overview\nInvestment Income\nOther income consists primarily of fees charged to policyholders by the Company for services outside of the premium charge, such as installment billings or policy issuance costs. Commission income is also received by the Company's insurance agencies for writing policies for third party insurance companies. Other income increased by $506,000, or 24.0%, to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $2.1 million in 2019. The increase in other income was primarily due to commissions from the growing wholesale agency business as well as increased fees charged on existing business.\nUnderwriting Results\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial Lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (8,307\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5,574\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,733\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personal Lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,091\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Underwriting\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,541\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,665\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Wholesale Agency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (474\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,304\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,403\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,064\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (339\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Eliminations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,140\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total underwriting income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (9,083\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (11,039\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet investment income decreased by $875,000, or 21.7%, to $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was due to a decrease in interest income in our debt securities. This occurred because of the decreasing yields driven by the decrease in prevailing market interest rates. Average invested assets as of December 31, 2020 were $176.5 million compared to $154.9 million for the same period in 2019. The averaged invested asset balance was comprised 80.2% debt securities, 7.1% equity securities and 12.7% short-term investments as of December 31, 2020. The average invested asset balance was comprised of 81.1% debt securities, 5.8% equity securities and 13.1% short-term investments as of December 31, 2019.\nThe following table shows the ratio of IBNR reserves to total reserves net of reinsurance recoverables as of December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):\n \u2022 Estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency; \nOur expense ratio increased by 1.6%, to 45.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nOutstanding Debt\n (2) The expense ratio is the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of policy acquisition costs and operating expenses to net earned premiums and other income from underwriting operations. The 2018 ratios have been recast to reflect the new presentation. Refer to Note 17 ~ Segment Information for further details. \nMost or all of these factors are not directly or precisely quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis, and are subject to a significant degree of variability over time. In addition, the establishment of loss and LAE reserves makes no provision for the broadening of coverage by legislative action or judicial interpretation or for the extraordinary future emergence of new types of losses not sufficiently represented in our historical experience or which cannot yet be quantified. As a result, an integral component of our loss and LAE reserving process is the use of informed subjective estimates and judgments about our ultimate exposure to losses and LAE. Accordingly, the ultimate liability may vary significantly from the current estimate. The effects of change in the estimated loss and LAE reserves are included in the results of operations in the period in which the estimate is revised.\nWe measure the performance of our consolidated results, in part, based on our underwriting gain or loss. The following table provides the underwriting gain or loss for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands):\nIn an effort to reduce interest costs, we restructured our debt during 2018 by issuing $25.3 million of public senior unsecured notes (the \"Notes\") and paid down $19.5 million of our subordinated notes to $10.5 million.\nWe use several generally accepted actuarial methods to develop estimated ultimate loss and LAE estimates by line of business and accident year. This process relies on the basic assumption that past experience, adjusted for the effects of current developments and likely trends, is a reasonable basis for predicting future outcomes. These methods utilize various inputs, including:\nSummary of Premium Revenue\nExpense Ratio\n \u2022 Assessment of asserted theories of liability; and \nOur expense ratio is a measure of the efficiency and performance of the commercial and personal lines of business (our risk-bearing underwriting operations). It is calculated by dividing the sum of policy acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses by the sum of net earned premiums and other income of the underwriting business. Costs that cannot be readily identifiable as a direct cost of a segment or product line remain in Corporate for segment reporting purposes. The expense ratio excludes wholesale agency and Corporate expenses. In prior periods the wholesale agency operations and Corporate expenses were included in the expense ratio calculation. We have changed the calculation to remove wholesale agency operations and Corporate expenses to provide a better measure of the underwriting operations' efficiency. The 2018 ratios have been recast to reflect the new presentation. Refer to Note 17 ~ Segment Information for further details.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nOur expenses consist primarily of losses and loss adjustment expenses, agents' commissions, and other underwriting and administrative expenses. We organize our operations in three insurance businesses: commercial insurance lines, personal lines, and agency business. Together, the commercial and personal lines refer to underwriting\u201d operations that take insurance risk, and the agency business refers to non-risk insurance business.\nThe Company received a one-time dividend from an investment for $213,000 in the third quarter of 2019.\nExecutive Overview\nThe following table is a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):\nThe table below provides the expense ratio by major component:\nThe 2020 results were mainly driven by net realized investment gains, and net investment income of $8.1 million and $3.2 million, respectively. The largest difference between net income and the adjusted operating loss is related to the $8.4 million of net realized investment gains, and other gains, net of tax.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are an insurance holding company that markets and services our product offerings through specialty commercial and specialty personal insurance business lines. Our growth has been significant since our founding in 2009. Currently, we are authorized to write insurance as an excess and surplus lines carrier in 45 states, including the District of Columbia. We are licensed to write insurance as an admitted carrier in 42 states, including the District of Columbia, and we offer our insurance products in all 50 states.\nThe portfolio's average quality was AA at December 31, 2019 and 2018. The portfolio produced a tax-equivalent book yield of 2.6% and 2.8% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The duration-to-worst average of the debt securities portfolio was 3.0 years and 3.1 years at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nCertain statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which are not statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events or our future financial or operating performance. Words such as anticipate,\u201d believe,\u201d estimate,\u201d expect,\u201d \"will,\" intend,\u201d may,\u201d plan,\u201d seek\u201d and similar terms and phrases, or the negative thereof, may be used to identify forward-looking statements.\nOperating expenses consist primarily of employee compensation, information technology and occupancy costs, such as rent and utilities. Operating expenses as a percent of net earned premiums and other income was 15.3% and 15.8% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The operating expense ratio was lower due to our expense reduction efforts, partially offset by higher ceded premium rates discussed above.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had $21.5 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Our principal sources of funds are insurance premiums, investment income, proceeds from maturity and sale of invested assets and other income. These funds are primarily used to pay claims, commissions, employee compensation, taxes and other operating expenses, and service debt.\nWe allocate the applicable portion of our estimated loss and LAE reserves to amounts recoverable from reinsurers under reinsurance contracts and report those amounts separately from our loss and LAE reserves as an asset on our balance sheet.\nThe NAIC's Insurance Regulatory Information System ( IRIS\u201d) was developed to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states. IRIS identifies thirteen industry ratios and specifies usual values\u201d for each ratio. State insurance regulators review the IRIS ratio results to determine if an insurer is in need of further regulatory scrutiny or action. While the ratios, individually and collectively, are useful tools for identifying companies that may be experiencing financial difficulty, they are only a guide for regulators and should not be considered an absolute indicator of a Company's financial condition. While inquiries from regulators are not uncommon, our Insurance Company Subsidiaries have not experienced any regulatory actions due to their IRIS ratio results or otherwise.\nPersonal lines gross written premiums increased $1.1 million, or 14.9%, to $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $7.5 million for the same period in 2019. This increase was largely driven by our low value dwelling business.\nOperating expenses consist primarily of employee compensation, information technology and occupancy costs, such as rent and utilities. Operating expenses as a percent of net earned premiums and other income was 15.8% and 16.7% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nRegulatory and Rating Issues\n \u2022 Loss ratio method-This method uses loss and LAE ratios for prior accident years, adjusted for current trends, to determine an appropriate expected loss and LAE ratio for a given accident year; \nThe $10.6 million of adverse development in 2019 consisted of $7.6 million from commercial lines and $3.0 million from personal lines and mostly related to the 2017 and 2016 accident years.\nThe carrying value of the Notes and subordinated notes are offset by $1.6 million of debt issuance costs that will be amortized through interest expense over the life of the loans. Refer to Note 7 ~ Debt of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding our outstanding debt.\nWe evaluate our available-for-sale investments regularly to determine whether there have been declines in value that are other-than-temporary. Our outside investment managers assist us in this evaluation. When we determine that a security has experienced an other-than-temporary impairment, the impairment loss is recognized as a realized investment loss.\n \u2022 The severity of injury or damage; \nNet investment income increased by $695,000, or 20.8%, to $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was mainly due to an increase in average invested assets during 2019. Average invested assets as of December 31, 2019 were $154.9 million, compared to $148.9 million as of December 31, 2018, an increase of $6.0 million, or 4.0%. As of December 31, 2019, the average invested asset balance was comprised of 81.1% debt securities, 5.8% equity securities and 13.1% short-term investments, compared to the December 31, 2018 mix of 86.3% debt securities, 6.9% equity securities and 6.8% short term investments.\n\nUnderwriting Results\nThe $10.6 million of adverse development in 2019 consisted of $7.6 million from commercial lines and $3.0 million from personal lines and mostly related to the 2017 and 2016 accident years.\nIn 2018, the Company recognized a measurement period adjustment of $42,735 related to loss reserve discounting, which reduced deferred tax expense. The Company also recognized a measurement period adjustment of $42,735 related to the loss reserve discounting transitional adjustment, which increased deferred tax expense. The measurement period adjustments were based upon obtaining additional information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the enactment date that, if known, would have affected the income tax effects initially reported as provisional amounts under the Act. The measurement period adjustments had no effect on the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018. The\nCash Flows\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCOVID-19 (the Pandemic\u201d) is causing significant disruption to public health, the global economy, financial markets, and commercial, social and community activity generally. Our exposure to the Pandemic is manifold. The majority of our employees are now working remotely in observance of shelter-in-place\u201d or stay-at-home\u201d government orders. A significant portion of our revenues are generated from the hospitality sector of the U.S. economy, which has seen unprecedented contraction, at least in the near term, in an effort to mitigate the effects of the Pandemic. We have continued to provide customer service, process new and renewal business, handle claims and otherwise manage all operations even though the vast majority of the staff is working remotely. At this time, however, we are not able to provide additional forward-looking guidance as there is significant uncertainty regarding the ultimate impact of the Pandemic.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nLosses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nDeferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state and federal pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. The assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income or loss.\nAdjusted operating income (loss) and adjusted operating income (loss) per share are non-GAAP measures that represent net income allocable to common shareholders excluding net realized investment and other gains (losses), net of tax, the effects of tax reform, the tax effect of changes in unrealized gains to the extent included in net income, the change in the fair value of equity securities, net of tax, and the capitalization and amortization of deferred gains from the ADC. The most directly comparable financial GAAP measures to adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share are net income and net income per share, respectively. Adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share are intended as supplemental information and are not meant to replace net income or net income per share. Adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial results. Our definition of adjusted operating income may be different from that used by other companies. The following is a reconciliation of net income to adjusted operating income (dollars in thousands), as well as net income per share to adjusted operating income per share:\nThe following table summarizes our operating results for the years indicated (dollars in thousands):\nResults of Operations - 2019 Compared to 2018\nThe following table summarizes our operating results for the years indicated (dollars in thousands):\nThe estimation of ultimate liability for losses and LAE is a complex, imprecise and inherently uncertain process, and therefore involves a considerable degree of judgment and expertise. Our loss and LAE reserves do not represent an exact measurement of liability, but are estimates based upon various factors, including but not limited to:\nThe principal standard actuarial methods used by our actuaries for their comprehensive reviews include:\nUnderwriting Gain (Loss)\nWe have changed the calculation to remove wholesale agency operations and corporate headquarters operations to provide a better measure of the underwriting operations' efficiency. The loss ratio calculation excludes other income from wholesale agency and Corporate. The 2018 ratios have been recast to reflect the new presentation. Refer to Note 17 ~ Segment Information for further details.\nOur actuaries give different weights to each of these methods based upon the amount of historical experience data by line of business and by accident year, and based on judgment as to what method is believed to result in the most accurate estimate. The application of each method by line of business and by accident year may change in the future if it is determined that a different emphasis for each method would result in more accurate estimates.\n \u2022 Expenses intended to cover the ultimate cost of settling claims, including investigation and defense of lawsuits resulting from such claims, costs of outside adjusters and experts, and all other expenses which are identified to the case; and \nCash provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, was $6.3 million and $3.7 million, respectively. The $2.6 million increase in 2019 compared to 2018 was largely due to a $5.0 million issuance of common stock in 2019, and no issuance of common stock in 2018.\nThe Company maintains a $10.0 million line of credit with a national bank (the Lender\u201d). The line of credit bears interest at the London Interbank rate (\"LIBOR\") plus 2.75% per annum, payable monthly. The agreement includes several financial debt covenants, including a minimum tangible net worth, a minimum fixed-charge coverage ratio, and minimum statutory risk-based capital levels. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $7.75 million outstanding on the line of credit (including the PPP loan described above), and was in compliance with all of its financial debt covenants. On June 19, 2020, the line of credit was renewed with a maturity of June 18, 2021.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we continued to see growth in our commercial and personal lines in areas where we have had the most success. Our commercial lines gross written premiums increased by $8.4 million, or 8.9%, to $102.8 million in 2020, compared to $94.4 million in 2019. Personal lines gross written premiums increased by $1.1 million, or 14.9% to $8.6 million in 2020, compared to $7.5 million in 2019.\n\nOur recorded loss and loss adjustment expenses (\"LAE\") reserves represent management's best estimate of unpaid loss and LAE at each balance sheet date, based on information, facts and circumstances known at such time. Our loss and LAE reserves reflect our estimates at the balance sheet date of:\n (1) The loss ratio is the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of net losses and loss adjustment expenses to net earned premiums and other income from underwriting operations. The 2018 ratios have been recast to reflect the new presentation. Refer to Note 17 ~ Segment Information for further details. \nInterest expense was $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. We issued $25.3 million of public senior unsecured notes (the \"Notes\") in 2018. Proceeds from the Notes were used to pay down $19.5 million of the $30.0 million of subordinated notes that were issued in the third quarter of 2017. The Company repurchased 36,761 units of the Notes in the public market in 2020. Interest expense includes the amortization of debt issuance costs relating to the Notes which is $260,000 per annum over the 5-year life of the Notes. The interest expense relating to the amortization of debt issuance costs for the existing $10.5 million of the subordinated notes is $51,000 per annum over the 20-year life of the subordinated notes.\n\nNet realized investment gains increased by $1.1 million to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $61,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was mostly attributed to the increase in value of the Company's equity securities in 2019.\nThe $9.0 million of adverse development in 2018 consisted of $6.2 million from commercial lines and $2.8 million from personal lines and mostly related to the 2016 and 2015 accident years.\nOur expense ratio decreased by 1.9%, to 44.0% for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018. The decrease in the expense ratio was primarily due to lower operating and reinsurance costs in 2019 compared to 2018. The reduction in the expense ratio was partially offset by lower net earned premium in 2019 compared to 2018.\nOur premiums are presented below for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in thousands):\nNet losses and LAE decreased by $3.5 million, or 5.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The calendar year loss ratios were 62.8% and 66.8% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nPolicy acquisition costs are costs we incur to issue policies, which include commissions, premium taxes, underwriting reports and underwriter compensation costs. The Company offsets direct commissions with ceded commissions from reinsurers. The percentage of policy acquisition costs to net earned premiums and other income increased by 2.1%, from 28.2 in 2019 to 30.3% in 2020. The acquisition cost ratio was higher mostly due to higher ceded premium rates in 2020 compared to 2019.\nWe use adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share, in conjunction with other financial measures, to assess our performance and to evaluate the results of our business. We believe these measures provide investors with valuable information relating to our ongoing performance that may be obscured by the effect of investment gains and losses as a result of our market risk sensitive instruments, which primarily relate to fixed income securities that are available-for-sale and not held for trading purposes. Realized investment gains and losses may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by external economic developments, such as capital market conditions. Accordingly, adjusted operating income excludes the effect of items that tend to be highly variable from period to period and highlights the results from our ongoing business operations and the underlying loss or profitability of our business. We believe that it is useful for investors to evaluate adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share, along with net income and net income per share, when reviewing and evaluating our performance.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company reported $6,000 of current federal income tax expense and $0 of current state income tax expense. The Company reported a deferred tax benefit of $0 and $940,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The deferred tax benefit in 2019 was a result of the change in the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to the changes in unrealized gains. No such impact occurred in 2020. The Company in 2020 had $808,000 of taxable income, which was fully offset by the utilization of the net operating losses carried forward from previous years.\nThe Company has a $10.0 million line of credit, which it drew upon and paid down at various times throughout 2019, and which contributed to interest expense.\nSummary of Premium Revenue\nThe Company also has outstanding $10.5 million of subordinated notes maturing on September 30, 2038. The subordinated notes bear an interest rate of 7.5% per annum until September 30, 2023, and 12.5% thereafter, and allow for four quarterly interest payment deferrals. Interest is payable quarterly at the end of March, June, September and December. Beginning September 30, 2021, the Company may redeem the subordinated notes, in whole or in part, for a call premium of $1.1 million. The call premium escalates each quarter to ultimately $1.75 million on September 30, 2023, then steps up to $3.05 million on December 31, 2023, and increases quarterly at a 12.5% per annum rate thereafter.\nCommittee (which includes our Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer, other members of executive management, and key actuarial, underwriting and claims personnel) meets each quarter to review our actuaries' estimated ultimate expected loss and LAE.\nThere is a $13.6 million valuation allowance against 100% of the net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2019, which would increase book value by $1.41 per share if reversed in the future. The valuation allowance was $12.6 million as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of $60.0 million, of which $50.0 million expire in tax years 2020 through 2039 and $10.0 million never expire. Of this amount, $14.1 million are limited in the amount that can be utilized in any one year and may expire before they are realized under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company has state net operating loss carryforwards of $17.7 million, which expire in tax years 2021 through 2039.\nOur premiums are presented below for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands):\nInvestment Valuation and Impairment\nOn April 24, 2020, the Company received a $2.7 million PPP loan from the line of credit Lender pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program of the CARES Act administered by the SBA. The PPP loan was incorporated into the existing line of credit facility and utilizes a portion of the line of credit's limit. However, the PPP loan has a different maturity date (April 24, 2022) in accordance with the SBA requirements and bears interest at a rate of 1.0% per annum. The Company amended its $10.0 million line of credit facility with the Lender to incorporate this loan as a reduction of the available line of credit. The loan may be prepaid by the Company at any time prior to maturity with no prepayment penalties. This loan may be subject to forgiveness under the CARES Act provisions. The Company applied for forgiveness of the loan in 2020, at which point the principal and interest payments were deferred until the SBA remits the loan forgiveness amount to the Lender. No assumptions were made relative to potential forgiveness as of December 31, 2020.\nLosses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nPremiums\nFair values are measured in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements. The guidance establishes a framework for measuring fair value and a three-level hierarchy based upon the quality of inputs used to measure fair value. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are: (1) Level 1: inputs are based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, (2) Level 2: inputs are other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liabilities, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability and (3) Level 3: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity. The unobservable inputs represent the Company's best assumption of how market participants would price the assets or liabilities. The Company also has investment company limited partnership investments, which are measured at net asset value (NAV). The fair value of these investments is based on the capital account balances reported by the investment funds subject to their management review and adjustment. The capital account balances reflect the fair value of the investment funds.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur expense ratio is a measure of the efficiency and performance of the commercial and personal lines of business (our risk-bearing underwriting operations). It is calculated by dividing the sum of policy acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses by the sum of net earned premiums and other income of the underwriting business. Costs that cannot be readily identifiable as a direct cost of a segment or product line remain in Corporate for segment reporting purposes. The expense ratio excludes wholesale agency and Corporate expenses.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, was $25.0 million as compared to cash provided by investing activities of $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in funds used in investing activities was due to an increase in funds available to be invested in our investment portfolio in the insurance subsidiaries.\n \u2022 Case reserves, which are unpaid loss and LAE amounts that have been reported; and \nInsurance operations are subject to various leverage tests (e.g., premium-to-statutory surplus ratios), which are evaluated by regulators and rating agencies. As of December 31, 2020, on a trailing twelve-month statutory combined basis, the gross written and net written premium leverage ratios were 1.7 to 1.0 and 1.5 to 1.0, respectively.\nWe review fair value prices provided by our outside investment managers for reasonableness by comparing the fair values provided by the managers to those provided by our investment custodian. We also review and monitor changes in unrealized gains and losses. We obtain an understanding of the methods, models and inputs used by our investment managers and independent pricing services, and controls are in place to validate that prices provided represent fair values. Our control process includes initial and ongoing evaluation of the methodologies used, a review of specific securities and an assessment for proper classification within the fair value hierarchy.\nThe following table displays ultimate net loss and LAE and net loss and LAE reserves by accident year for the year ended December 31, 2020. We applied the sensitivity factors to each accident year amount and have calculated the amount of potential net loss and LAE reserve change and the impact on 2020 reported pre-tax income and on net income and shareholders' equity at December 31, 2020. We believe it is not appropriate to sum the illustrated amounts as it is not reasonably likely that each accident year's reserve estimate assumptions will vary simultaneously in the same direction to the full extent of the sensitivity factor. We also believe that such changes to our reserve balance would not have a material impact on our operating results, financial position, or liquidity. The net income and shareholders' equity amounts include an income tax rate assumption of 21%. The dollar amounts in the table are in thousands.\n (1) The estimated unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense payments were made using estimates based on historical payment patterns. However, future payments may be different than historical payment patterns. \n\nThe fair values of debt and equity securities have been determined using fair value prices provided by our investment managers, who utilize internationally recognized independent pricing services. The prices provided by the independent pricing services are generally based on observable market data in active markets (e.g., broker quotes and prices observed for comparable securities).\n \u2022 Paid and reported losses and LAE; \n\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\n \u2022 Any other information considered pertinent to estimating the indemnity and expense exposure presented by the claim. \nThere is a $13.3 million valuation allowance against 100% of the net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2020, which would increase book value by $1.37 per share if reversed in the future. The valuation allowance was $13.6 million as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of $59.2 million, of which $49.3 million expire in tax years 2028 through 2039 and $9.9 million never expire. Of this amount, $14.1 million are limited in the amount that can be utilized in any one year and may expire before they are realized under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company has state net operating loss carryforwards of $17.1 million, which expire in tax years 2021 through 2040.\n\nCase reserves are initially set by our claims personnel. When a claim is reported to us, our claims department completes a case-basis valuation and establishes a case reserve for the estimated amount of the probable ultimate losses and LAE associated with that claim. Our claims department updates their case-basis valuations upon receipt of additional information and reduces case reserves as claims are paid. The case reserve is based primarily upon an evaluation of the following factors:\nOther Income\n (1) The loss ratio is the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of net losses and loss adjustment expenses to net earned premiums and other income from underwriting operations. \nInvestment Income\n \u2022 Frequency/severity method-This method projects claim counts and average cost per claim on a paid or reported basis for high frequency, low severity products. \nRefer to Note 1 ~ Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: Recently Issued Accounting Guidance of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed information.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company reported $0 of current federal income tax expense and $27,000 of current state income tax expense. The Company reported a deferred tax benefit of $940,000 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in the deferred tax benefit in 2019 was a result of the change in the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to the changes in unrealized gains.\n\nWe do not discount the loss and LAE reserves for the time value of money.\n\nAdjusted operating loss, a non-GAAP measure, was $8.0 million, or $0.83 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to an adjusted operating loss of $15.1 million, or $1.69 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n \u2022 Loss development methods-Loss development methods assume that the losses and LAE yet to emerge for an accident year are proportional to the paid or reported loss and LAE amounts observed to-date. The paid loss development method uses losses and LAE paid to date, while the reported loss development method uses losses and LAE reported to date; \nThe carrying value of our gross deferred tax asset for the NOL carryforwards is equal to the total NOL carryforward amount times the applicable federal and state tax rates, and was $13.3 million and $13.5 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Total gross deferred tax assets were $17.2 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. A valuation allowance of $13.3 million and $13.6 million has been recorded against the gross deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as the Company has recognized a three-year cumulative loss as of December 31, 2020 which is significant negative evidence to support the lack of recoverability of those deferred tax assets in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. If the $13.3 million valuation allowance as of December 31, 2020 were reversed in the future, it would increase book value by $1.37 per share. The net deferred tax liabilities were zero as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n \u2022 Written and earned premiums; \nThrough our personal insurance lines, we offer homeowners insurance and dwelling fire insurance products to individuals in several states. Our specialty homeowners insurance product line is primarily comprised of low-value dwelling\nOperating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $3.0 million, compared to $15.4 million for the same period in 2019. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a $6.0 million increase in paid claims, a decrease of $3.0 million of cash received from agencies, and a $2.1 million decrease in cash received under certain fronting arrangements. These reductions in cash flow provided by operating activities were partially offset by a $3.1 million increase in premiums collected, net of reinsurance premiums.\nOur loss and LAE reserves do not represent an exact measurement of liability, but are estimates. The most significant assumptions affecting our IBNR reserve estimates are the loss development factors applied to paid losses and case reserves to develop IBNR by line of business and accident year. Although historical loss development provides us with an indication of future loss development, it typically varies from year to year. Thus, for each accident year within each line of business we select one loss development factor out of a range of historical factors.\n\nThe tables below detail our losses and LAE and loss ratios for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in thousands).\nNet realized investment gains increased by $6.9 million, or 579%, to $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was attributed to the company harvesting gains from the increase in value of its bond portfolio in 2020. The Company also experienced gains in its equity securities with the market increasing in value during the second half of 2020. Some of these equity gains were realized upon sale.\nWe generated a sensitivity analysis of our net reserves which represents reasonably likely levels of variability in our selected loss development factors. We believe the most meaningful approach to the sensitivity analysis is to vary the loss development factors that drive the ultimate loss and LAE estimates. We applied this approach on an accident year basis, reflecting the reasonably likely differences in variability by level of maturity of the underlying loss experience for each accident year. Generally, the most recent accident years are characterized by more unreported losses and less information available for settling claims, and have more inherent uncertainty than the reserve estimates for more mature accident years. Therefore, we used variability factors of plus or minus 10% for the most recent accident year, 5% for the preceding accident year, and 2.5% for the second preceding accident year. There is minimal expected variability for accident years at four or more years' maturity.\nOur actuaries estimate an IBNR reserve for our unallocated LAE not specifically identified to a particular claim, namely our internal claims department salaries and associated general overhead and administrative expenses associated with the adjustment and processing of claims. These estimates, which are referred to as unallocated loss adjustment expense (\"ULAE\") reserves, are based on internal cost studies and analyses reflecting the relationship of ULAE paid to actual paid and incurred losses. We select factors that are applied to case reserves and IBNR reserve estimates in order to estimate the amount of ULAE reserves applicable to estimated loss reserves at the balance sheet date.\nWe believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and investment securities balances will be adequate to meet our capital and liquidity needs and the needs of our subsidiaries on a short-term and long-term basis.\nNet written premiums decreased $1.4 million, or 1.5%, to $87.7 million, for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $89.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to the reduction in the commercial lines business.\nThe table below provides the expense ratio by major component:\nThe Company has a $10.0 million line of credit, which it drew upon and paid down at various times throughout 2020, and which contributed to interest expense.\nThe Company received a one-time dividend from an investment for $213,000 in the third quarter of 2019.\n (3) The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. A combined ratio under 100% indicates an underwriting profit. A combined ratio over 100% indicates an underwriting loss. \nExpense Ratio\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n \u2022 Bornheutter-Ferguson method-This method is a combination of the loss ratio and loss development methods, where the loss development factor is given more weight as an accident year matures; and \n \u2022 Incurred but not reported (\"IBNR\") reserves, which are (1) unpaid loss and LAE amounts that have been incurred but not yet reported; and (2) the expected development on case reserves. \nThe tables below detail our losses and LAE and loss ratios for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands).\nThe forward-looking statements contained in this report are based on management's good-faith belief and reasonable judgment based on current information. The forward-looking statements are qualified by important factors, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including those described above in Item 1A Risk Factors and subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the SEC. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this report speaks only as of the date hereof or as of the date specified herein. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by any applicable laws or regulations.\nGross written premiums increased by $9.5 million, or 9.3%, to $111.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $101.9 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was attributable to an increase in written premium in our small business programs, which was slightly offset by a decrease in written premium in our hospitality programs.\n (3) The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. A combined ratio under 100% indicates an underwriting profit. A combined ratio over 100% indicates an underwriting loss. \nOur revenues are primarily derived from premiums earned from our insurance operations. We also generate other revenues through investment income and other income which mainly consists of: installment fees and policy issuance fees generally related to the policies we write.\nSummary Operating Results\n\nAdjusted Operating Income (Loss) and Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) Per Share\n\nCash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, was $15.4 million as compared to cash used in operating activities of $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $32.4 million increase in cash from operations was mostly due to a $28.4 million increase in cash received from reinsurers due to ceded losses, including $12.5 million of cash received in 2019 from the ADC. Also, ceded premiums paid to reinsurers decreased by $2.6 million in 2019 compared to 2018.\nWe measure the performance of our consolidated results, in part, based on our underwriting gain or loss. The following table provides the underwriting gain or loss for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in thousands):\n \u2022 Expected claim reporting and payout patterns based on our own loss experience and supplemented with insurance industry data where applicable. \nOther Income\n (2) Includes estimated future payments under the software license agreement relating to our policy issuance system. This agreement requires minimum monthly payments of $30,000, and is variable with premium volume. The future payment assumptions are based on the minimum monthly payments. The software license agreement expires on September 30, 2022. \nOur reserves consist entirely of reserves for property and liability losses, consistent with the coverages provided for in the insurance policies directly written or assumed by us under reinsurance contracts. Several years may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to us and our payment of the loss. The level of IBNR reserves in relation to total reserves depends upon the characteristics of the specific line of business, particularly related to the speed with which claims are reported and outstanding claims are paid. Lines of business for which claims are reported slowly will have a higher percentage of IBNR reserves than lines of business that report and settle claims more quickly.\nWe contributed $1.2 million to our Insurance Company Subsidiaries in 2020. We contributed $3.9 million to our Insurance Company Subsidiaries in 2019. No contributions to our Insurance Company Subsidiaries were made in 2018. We believe that the current statutory surplus levels and the funds available at the holding company level will provide the necessary statutory capital to support our premium volume growth over the next two years.\ninsurance tailored for owners of lower valued homes, which we offer in Illinois, Indiana and Texas. Due to ongoing Florida-based industry events, we have been de-emphasizing our Florida homeowners' business and reducing our exposures in that state, as well as other wind-exposed states like Texas and Hawaii.\nResults of Operations - 2020 Compared to 2019\nThe impact from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma continued to recede in 2020. Loss development on Hurricane Harvey was $89,000 in 2020 compared to $313,000 in 2019. Catastrophe reinstatement costs from Irma were $195,000 in 2020, compared to $495,000 in 2019.\nInvesting Activities. Cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, was $7.3 million and $25.0 million, respectively. The $17.7M increase in the use of cash from investing activities over the prior year is due to increased activity across the Company's investment portfolio to take advantage of 2020 market conditions.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\n \u2022 The jurisdiction of the occurrence; \nThrough our commercial insurance lines, we offer coverage for both commercial property and commercial liability. We also offer coverage for commercial automobiles and workers' compensation. Our insurance policies are sold to targeted small and mid-sized businesses on a single or multiple-coverage basis.\nThrough our wholesale agency business segment, we offer commercial and personal lines insurance products for our Insurance Company Subsidiaries as well as third-party insurers. We have expanded the wholesale agency business to develop more non-risk revenue streams, and to provide our agents with more insurance product options.\nOur income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous state jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the consolidated income tax expense.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have federal and state income tax net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) carryforwards of $59.2 million and $17.1 million, respectively. Of the NOL carryforwards, $49.3 million will expire in tax years 2028 through 2039 and $9.9 million will never expire. Of the federal NOL amount, $14.1 million are subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. These net NOL carryforwards are limited in the amount that can be utilized in any one year and may expire before they are realized. At this time we do not expect that any of the remaining NOL carryforwards will expire before utilized.\nIn 2018, the Company recognized a measurement period adjustment of $42,735 related to loss reserve discounting, which reduced deferred tax expense. The Company also recognized a measurement period adjustment of $42,735 related to the loss reserve discounting transitional adjustment, which increased deferred tax expense. The measurement period adjustments were based upon obtaining additional information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the enactment date that, if known, would have affected the income tax effects initially reported as provisional amounts under the Act. The measurement period adjustments had no effect on the effective tax rate for the year ending December 31, 2018. The accounting for the income tax effects of the Act pursuant to SAB 118 has been completed as of the end of the December 22, 2018, measurement period and for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nPremiums are earned ratably over the term of the policy, whereas written premiums are reflected on the effective date of the policy. Almost all commercial lines and homeowners products have annual policies, under which premiums are earned evenly over one year. The resulting net earned premiums are impacted by the gross and ceded written premiums, earned ratably over the terms of the policies.\n \u2022 Actuarial projections of what we, at a given time, expect to be the cost of the ultimate settlement and administration of claims reflecting facts and circumstances then known; \nPolicy acquisition costs are costs we incur to issue policies, which include commissions, premium taxes, underwriting reports and underwriter compensation costs. The Company offsets direct commissions with ceded commissions from reinsurers. The percentage of policy acquisition costs to net earned premiums and other income decreased by 1.0%, from 29.2% in 2018, to 28.2% in 2019.\nThe Company's commercial lines experienced low claims activity during 2020 due to COVID-19. While substantially all businesses maintained their insurance, liability losses were lower as restaurants, bars, and other small businesses were required to limit business or totally shut down for a period of time. This reduced the potential to incur liability losses and contributed to the lower current accident year loss ratio. Potential exposures to COVID-19 losses were minimal as we include strict exclusions to business interruption coverage related to bacterial or viral causes on most policies and require physical property damage for the business interruption coverage to be effective on all policies. We also do not provide coverage relating to event cancellations, travel insurance or other coverages that could directly generate such losses. We believe we also have limited exposures relating to our workers compensation coverages which are generally companion coverages with our existing commercial policies, which represents a small amount of our overall premiums and does not appear to be heavily exposed to COVID-19-related losses.\nInterest Expense\n* Percentage change is not meaningful\nThe Company reported net income of $595,000, or $0.06 per share, in 2020, compared to a net loss of $7.8 million, or $0.88 per share, in 2019.\nGross written premiums decreased by $2.5 million, or 2.4%, to $101.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $104.4 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was attributable to a reduction in written premium in our hospitality programs, which was slightly offset by an increase in written premium in our small business programs.\nWe carry debt securities classified as available-for-sale at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses on such securities, net of any deferred taxes, are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Our equity securities that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method are measured at fair value and any changes in fair value are recognized in net income. We carry other equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value at cost, less impairment and adjusted for observable price changes under the measurement alternative provided under GAAP. We review these investments for impairment during each reporting period. We do not have any securities classified as trading or held-to-maturity.\nSources and Uses of Funds\nCommercial lines gross written premiums decreased $3.3 million, or 3.4%, to $94.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $97.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our hospitality programs' gross written premiums decreased $6.6 million, or 12.0%, to $48.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $55.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. However, gross written premiums for our small business programs increased by $3.3 million, or 7.7%, to $46.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $42.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nInterest expense was $2.9 million and $2.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We issued $25.3 million of Notes in 2018. Proceeds from the Notes were used to pay down $19.5 million of the $30.0 million of subordinated notes that were issued in the third quarter of 2017. Interest expense includes the amortization of debt issuance costs relating to the new Notes which is $260,000 per annum over the 5-year life of the Notes. The interest expense relating to the amortization of debt issuance costs for the existing $10.5 million of the subordinated notes is $50,000 per annum over the 20-year life of the subordinated notes.\nThe $15.6 million of adverse development in 2020 consisted of $15.2 million from commercial lines and $352,000 from personal lines and mostly related to the 2018 and 2017 accident years.\n \u2022 Our knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the claim; \nWe are aware that our outstanding debt securities are currently trading at a discount to their face amount. In order to reduce future cash interest payments, as well as future amounts due at maturity or upon redemption, we may, from time to time, purchase such debt for cash, in exchange for common stock, or for a combination of cash and common stock, in open market or privately negotiated transactions. We will evaluate any such transactions in light of then-existing market conditions, taking into account our current liquidity and prospects for future access to capital. The amounts involved in such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material.\nWe consider a number of factors in assessing whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, including (1) the amount and percentage that current fair value is below cost or amortized cost, (2) the length of time that the fair value has been below cost or amortized cost and (3) recent corporate developments or other factors that may impact an issuer's near term prospects. In addition, for debt securities, we consider the credit quality ratings for the securities, with a special emphasis on securities downgraded to below investment grade. We also consider our intent to sell available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, and if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before a recovery in fair value to their cost or amortized cost basis.\nPremiums are earned ratably over the term of the policy, whereas written premiums are reflected on the effective date of the policy. Almost all commercial lines and homeowners products have annual policies, under which premiums are earned evenly over one year. The resulting net earned premiums are impacted by the gross and ceded written premiums, earned ratably over the terms of the policies.", "item_7_text": "Financing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, was $5.1 million and $6.3 million, respectively. The decrease of $1.2 million in 2020 of cash provided by financing activities was due to no issuance of common stock in 2020, and $5.0 million issuance of common stock in 2019. This decrease was offset by an increase in borrowings from the Company's line of credit.\nThe portfolio's average quality was AA+ and AA at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The portfolio produced a tax-equivalent book yield of 1.6% and 2.6% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The option adjusted duration of the debt securities portfolio was 3.6 years and 2.8 years at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nForward-Looking Statements\nRealized Investment Gains\n \u2022 Expected initial loss and LAE ratio, which is the ratio of incurred losses and LAE to earned premiums; and \nRecent Developments\nCommercial lines gross written premiums increased $8.4 million, or 8.9%, to $102.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $94.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Gross written premiums for our small business programs increased by $19.1 million, or 41.5%, to $65.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $46.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was offset by our hospitality programs gross written premiums, which decreased by $10.7 million, or 22.1%, to $37.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $48.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\naccounting for the income tax effects of the Act pursuant to SAB 118 has been completed as of the end of the December 22, 2018, measurement period and for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nNet written premiums increased $5.2 million, or 5.9%, to $92.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $87.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to the growth experienced in the commercial lines business. However, increased reinsurance rates tempered the growth of gross written premiums.\nAlthough we believe that our reserve estimates are reasonable, it is possible that our actual loss and LAE experience may not conform to our assumptions and may, in fact, vary significantly from our assumptions. Accordingly, the ultimate settlement of losses and the related LAE may vary significantly from the estimates included in our financial statements. We continually review our estimates and adjust them as we believe appropriate as our experience develops or new information becomes known to us. Such adjustments are included in current operations.\nInterest Expense\nAt December 31, 2020, all of our Insurance Company Subsidiaries were in excess of any minimum threshold at which corrective action would be required.\nGeneral\nWe conduct our business operations primarily through our Insurance Company Subsidiaries. Our ability to service debt, and pay administrative expenses is primarily reliant upon our intercompany service fees paid by the Insurance Company Subsidiaries to the holding company for management, administrative, and information technology services provided to the Insurance Company Subsidiaries by the Parent Company. Secondarily, the Parent Company may receive dividends from the Insurance Company Subsidiaries; however, this is not the primary means in which the holding company supports its funding as state insurance laws restrict the ability of our Insurance Company Subsidiaries to declare dividends to the Parent Company. Generally, the limitations are based on the greater of statutory net income for the preceding year or 10% of statutory surplus at the end of the preceding year. No dividends were paid from our Insurance Company Subsidiaries in 2020, 2019 or 2018.\nPremiums\nNet losses and LAE decreased by $2.7 million, or 4.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018. The calendar year loss ratios were 66.8% and 66.4% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe identified the accounting estimates below as critical to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations. Critical accounting estimates are defined as those estimates that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and which require us to exercise significant judgment. We use significant judgment concerning future results and developments in applying these critical accounting estimates and in preparing our consolidated financial statements. These judgments and estimates affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of material contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ materially from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates regularly using information that we believe to be relevant. See the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 ~ Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for further details.\n \u2022 Policy provisions related to the claim; \nIBNR reserves are determined by subtracting case reserves and paid loss and LAE from the estimated ultimate loss and LAE. Our actuarial department develops estimated ultimate loss and LAE on a quarterly basis. Our Reserve Review\n\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements, related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d).\nThe values for publicly-traded equity securities are generally based on Level 1 inputs which use the market approach valuation technique. The values for debt securities generally incorporate significant Level 2 inputs. The carrying value of cash and short-term investments approximate their fair values due to their short-term maturity.\nOur actuaries also analyze several diagnostic measures by line of business and accident year, including but not limited to: reported and closed frequency and severity, claim reporting and claim closing patterns, paid and incurred loss ratio development, and ratios of paid loss and LAE to incurred loss and LAE. After the actuarial methods and diagnostic measures have been performed and analyzed, our actuaries use their judgment and expertise to select an estimated ultimate loss and LAE by line of business and by accident year.\nUnderwriting Gain (Loss)\nThe NAIC has a RBC formula to be applied to all property and casualty insurance companies. The formula measures required capital and surplus based on an insurance company's products and investment portfolio and is used as a tool to evaluate the capital adequacy of regulated companies. The RBC formula is used by state insurance regulators to monitor trends in statutory capital and surplus for the purpose of initiating regulatory action. In general, an insurance company must submit a calculation of its RBC formula to the insurance department of its state of domicile as of the end of the previous calendar year. These laws require increasing degrees of regulatory oversight and intervention as an insurance company's RBC declines.\n\n \u2022 The type of loss; \nIf, in the future, we determine we can support the recoverability of a portion or all of the deferred tax assets under the guidance, the tax benefits relating to any reversal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets will be accounted for as a reduction of income tax expense and result in an increase in equity. Changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities and our effective tax rate in the future.\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves\nOther income consists primarily of fees charged to policyholders by the Company for services outside of the premium charge, such as installment billings or policy issuance costs. Commission income is also received by the Company's insurance agencies for writing policies for third party insurance companies. Other income increased by $527,000, or 33.3%, to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $1.6 million in 2018. The increase in other income was primarily due to additional commission income in the wholesale agency operations as well as increased fees charged on existing business.\n\n* Percentage change is not meaningful\n\nSummary Operating Results\n \u2022 Analysis of other factors, such as variables in claims handling procedures, economic factors, and judicial and legislative trends and actions. \nPersonal lines gross written premiums increased $788,000, or 11.8%, to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $6.7 million for the same period in 2018. This was largely driven by an increase in our low value dwelling business.\n (2) The expense ratio is the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of policy acquisition costs and operating expenses to net earned premiums and other income from underwriting operations. \nRealized Investment Gains\nIn 2018, the Company issued $25.3 million of Notes. The Notes bear an interest rate of 6.75% annum, payable quarterly at the end of March, June, September and December and mature on September 30, 2023. Proceeds from the Notes were used to pay down $19.5 million of the $30.0 million of subordinated notes that were issued in the third quarter of 2017. The Company repurchased 36,761 units of the Notes in the public market during 2020 with a face value of $919,000. The Notes were repurchased at a discount to face value, which resulted in a $260,000 gain on extinguishment in 2020. This gain is reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as Other gains.\nBusiness Overview\nInvestment Income\nOther income consists primarily of fees charged to policyholders by the Company for services outside of the premium charge, such as installment billings or policy issuance costs. Commission income is also received by the Company's insurance agencies for writing policies for third party insurance companies. Other income increased by $506,000, or 24.0%, to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $2.1 million in 2019. The increase in other income was primarily due to commissions from the growing wholesale agency business as well as increased fees charged on existing business.\nUnderwriting Results\nNet investment income decreased by $875,000, or 21.7%, to $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was due to a decrease in interest income in our debt securities. This occurred because of the decreasing yields driven by the decrease in prevailing market interest rates. Average invested assets as of December 31, 2020 were $176.5 million compared to $154.9 million for the same period in 2019. The averaged invested asset balance was comprised 80.2% debt securities, 7.1% equity securities and 12.7% short-term investments as of December 31, 2020. The average invested asset balance was comprised of 81.1% debt securities, 5.8% equity securities and 13.1% short-term investments as of December 31, 2019.\nThe following table shows the ratio of IBNR reserves to total reserves net of reinsurance recoverables as of December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):\n \u2022 Estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency; \nOur expense ratio increased by 1.6%, to 45.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nOutstanding Debt\n (2) The expense ratio is the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of policy acquisition costs and operating expenses to net earned premiums and other income from underwriting operations. The 2018 ratios have been recast to reflect the new presentation. Refer to Note 17 ~ Segment Information for further details. \nMost or all of these factors are not directly or precisely quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis, and are subject to a significant degree of variability over time. In addition, the establishment of loss and LAE reserves makes no provision for the broadening of coverage by legislative action or judicial interpretation or for the extraordinary future emergence of new types of losses not sufficiently represented in our historical experience or which cannot yet be quantified. As a result, an integral component of our loss and LAE reserving process is the use of informed subjective estimates and judgments about our ultimate exposure to losses and LAE. Accordingly, the ultimate liability may vary significantly from the current estimate. The effects of change in the estimated loss and LAE reserves are included in the results of operations in the period in which the estimate is revised.\nWe measure the performance of our consolidated results, in part, based on our underwriting gain or loss. The following table provides the underwriting gain or loss for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands):\nIn an effort to reduce interest costs, we restructured our debt during 2018 by issuing $25.3 million of public senior unsecured notes (the \"Notes\") and paid down $19.5 million of our subordinated notes to $10.5 million.\nWe use several generally accepted actuarial methods to develop estimated ultimate loss and LAE estimates by line of business and accident year. This process relies on the basic assumption that past experience, adjusted for the effects of current developments and likely trends, is a reasonable basis for predicting future outcomes. These methods utilize various inputs, including:\nSummary of Premium Revenue\nExpense Ratio\n \u2022 Assessment of asserted theories of liability; and \nOur expense ratio is a measure of the efficiency and performance of the commercial and personal lines of business (our risk-bearing underwriting operations). It is calculated by dividing the sum of policy acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses by the sum of net earned premiums and other income of the underwriting business. Costs that cannot be readily identifiable as a direct cost of a segment or product line remain in Corporate for segment reporting purposes. The expense ratio excludes wholesale agency and Corporate expenses. In prior periods the wholesale agency operations and Corporate expenses were included in the expense ratio calculation. We have changed the calculation to remove wholesale agency operations and Corporate expenses to provide a better measure of the underwriting operations' efficiency. The 2018 ratios have been recast to reflect the new presentation. Refer to Note 17 ~ Segment Information for further details.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nOur expenses consist primarily of losses and loss adjustment expenses, agents' commissions, and other underwriting and administrative expenses. We organize our operations in three insurance businesses: commercial insurance lines, personal lines, and agency business. Together, the commercial and personal lines refer to underwriting\u201d operations that take insurance risk, and the agency business refers to non-risk insurance business.\nThe Company received a one-time dividend from an investment for $213,000 in the third quarter of 2019.\nExecutive Overview\nThe following table is a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):\nThe table below provides the expense ratio by major component:\nThe 2020 results were mainly driven by net realized investment gains, and net investment income of $8.1 million and $3.2 million, respectively. The largest difference between net income and the adjusted operating loss is related to the $8.4 million of net realized investment gains, and other gains, net of tax.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are an insurance holding company that markets and services our product offerings through specialty commercial and specialty personal insurance business lines. Our growth has been significant since our founding in 2009. Currently, we are authorized to write insurance as an excess and surplus lines carrier in 45 states, including the District of Columbia. We are licensed to write insurance as an admitted carrier in 42 states, including the District of Columbia, and we offer our insurance products in all 50 states.\nThe portfolio's average quality was AA at December 31, 2019 and 2018. The portfolio produced a tax-equivalent book yield of 2.6% and 2.8% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The duration-to-worst average of the debt securities portfolio was 3.0 years and 3.1 years at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nCertain statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which are not statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events or our future financial or operating performance. Words such as anticipate,\u201d believe,\u201d estimate,\u201d expect,\u201d \"will,\" intend,\u201d may,\u201d plan,\u201d seek\u201d and similar terms and phrases, or the negative thereof, may be used to identify forward-looking statements.\nOperating expenses consist primarily of employee compensation, information technology and occupancy costs, such as rent and utilities. Operating expenses as a percent of net earned premiums and other income was 15.3% and 15.8% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The operating expense ratio was lower due to our expense reduction efforts, partially offset by higher ceded premium rates discussed above.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had $21.5 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Our principal sources of funds are insurance premiums, investment income, proceeds from maturity and sale of invested assets and other income. These funds are primarily used to pay claims, commissions, employee compensation, taxes and other operating expenses, and service debt.\nWe allocate the applicable portion of our estimated loss and LAE reserves to amounts recoverable from reinsurers under reinsurance contracts and report those amounts separately from our loss and LAE reserves as an asset on our balance sheet.\nThe NAIC's Insurance Regulatory Information System ( IRIS\u201d) was developed to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states. IRIS identifies thirteen industry ratios and specifies usual values\u201d for each ratio. State insurance regulators review the IRIS ratio results to determine if an insurer is in need of further regulatory scrutiny or action. While the ratios, individually and collectively, are useful tools for identifying companies that may be experiencing financial difficulty, they are only a guide for regulators and should not be considered an absolute indicator of a Company's financial condition. While inquiries from regulators are not uncommon, our Insurance Company Subsidiaries have not experienced any regulatory actions due to their IRIS ratio results or otherwise.\nPersonal lines gross written premiums increased $1.1 million, or 14.9%, to $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $7.5 million for the same period in 2019. This increase was largely driven by our low value dwelling business.\nOperating expenses consist primarily of employee compensation, information technology and occupancy costs, such as rent and utilities. Operating expenses as a percent of net earned premiums and other income was 15.8% and 16.7% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nRegulatory and Rating Issues\n \u2022 Loss ratio method-This method uses loss and LAE ratios for prior accident years, adjusted for current trends, to determine an appropriate expected loss and LAE ratio for a given accident year; \nThe $10.6 million of adverse development in 2019 consisted of $7.6 million from commercial lines and $3.0 million from personal lines and mostly related to the 2017 and 2016 accident years.\nThe carrying value of the Notes and subordinated notes are offset by $1.6 million of debt issuance costs that will be amortized through interest expense over the life of the loans. Refer to Note 7 ~ Debt of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding our outstanding debt.\nWe evaluate our available-for-sale investments regularly to determine whether there have been declines in value that are other-than-temporary. Our outside investment managers assist us in this evaluation. When we determine that a security has experienced an other-than-temporary impairment, the impairment loss is recognized as a realized investment loss.\n \u2022 The severity of injury or damage; \nNet investment income increased by $695,000, or 20.8%, to $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was mainly due to an increase in average invested assets during 2019. Average invested assets as of December 31, 2019 were $154.9 million, compared to $148.9 million as of December 31, 2018, an increase of $6.0 million, or 4.0%. As of December 31, 2019, the average invested asset balance was comprised of 81.1% debt securities, 5.8% equity securities and 13.1% short-term investments, compared to the December 31, 2018 mix of 86.3% debt securities, 6.9% equity securities and 6.8% short term investments.\n\nUnderwriting Results\nThe $10.6 million of adverse development in 2019 consisted of $7.6 million from commercial lines and $3.0 million from personal lines and mostly related to the 2017 and 2016 accident years.\nIn 2018, the Company recognized a measurement period adjustment of $42,735 related to loss reserve discounting, which reduced deferred tax expense. The Company also recognized a measurement period adjustment of $42,735 related to the loss reserve discounting transitional adjustment, which increased deferred tax expense. The measurement period adjustments were based upon obtaining additional information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the enactment date that, if known, would have affected the income tax effects initially reported as provisional amounts under the Act. The measurement period adjustments had no effect on the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018. The\nCash Flows\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCOVID-19 (the Pandemic\u201d) is causing significant disruption to public health, the global economy, financial markets, and commercial, social and community activity generally. Our exposure to the Pandemic is manifold. The majority of our employees are now working remotely in observance of shelter-in-place\u201d or stay-at-home\u201d government orders. A significant portion of our revenues are generated from the hospitality sector of the U.S. economy, which has seen unprecedented contraction, at least in the near term, in an effort to mitigate the effects of the Pandemic. We have continued to provide customer service, process new and renewal business, handle claims and otherwise manage all operations even though the vast majority of the staff is working remotely. At this time, however, we are not able to provide additional forward-looking guidance as there is significant uncertainty regarding the ultimate impact of the Pandemic.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nLosses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nDeferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state and federal pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. The assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income or loss.\nAdjusted operating income (loss) and adjusted operating income (loss) per share are non-GAAP measures that represent net income allocable to common shareholders excluding net realized investment and other gains (losses), net of tax, the effects of tax reform, the tax effect of changes in unrealized gains to the extent included in net income, the change in the fair value of equity securities, net of tax, and the capitalization and amortization of deferred gains from the ADC. The most directly comparable financial GAAP measures to adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share are net income and net income per share, respectively. Adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share are intended as supplemental information and are not meant to replace net income or net income per share. Adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial results. Our definition of adjusted operating income may be different from that used by other companies. The following is a reconciliation of net income to adjusted operating income (dollars in thousands), as well as net income per share to adjusted operating income per share:\nThe following table summarizes our operating results for the years indicated (dollars in thousands):\nResults of Operations - 2019 Compared to 2018\nThe following table summarizes our operating results for the years indicated (dollars in thousands):\nThe estimation of ultimate liability for losses and LAE is a complex, imprecise and inherently uncertain process, and therefore involves a considerable degree of judgment and expertise. Our loss and LAE reserves do not represent an exact measurement of liability, but are estimates based upon various factors, including but not limited to:\nThe principal standard actuarial methods used by our actuaries for their comprehensive reviews include:\nUnderwriting Gain (Loss)\nWe have changed the calculation to remove wholesale agency operations and corporate headquarters operations to provide a better measure of the underwriting operations' efficiency. The loss ratio calculation excludes other income from wholesale agency and Corporate. The 2018 ratios have been recast to reflect the new presentation. Refer to Note 17 ~ Segment Information for further details.\nOur actuaries give different weights to each of these methods based upon the amount of historical experience data by line of business and by accident year, and based on judgment as to what method is believed to result in the most accurate estimate. The application of each method by line of business and by accident year may change in the future if it is determined that a different emphasis for each method would result in more accurate estimates.\n \u2022 Expenses intended to cover the ultimate cost of settling claims, including investigation and defense of lawsuits resulting from such claims, costs of outside adjusters and experts, and all other expenses which are identified to the case; and \nCash provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, was $6.3 million and $3.7 million, respectively. The $2.6 million increase in 2019 compared to 2018 was largely due to a $5.0 million issuance of common stock in 2019, and no issuance of common stock in 2018.\nThe Company maintains a $10.0 million line of credit with a national bank (the Lender\u201d). The line of credit bears interest at the London Interbank rate (\"LIBOR\") plus 2.75% per annum, payable monthly. The agreement includes several financial debt covenants, including a minimum tangible net worth, a minimum fixed-charge coverage ratio, and minimum statutory risk-based capital levels. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $7.75 million outstanding on the line of credit (including the PPP loan described above), and was in compliance with all of its financial debt covenants. On June 19, 2020, the line of credit was renewed with a maturity of June 18, 2021.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we continued to see growth in our commercial and personal lines in areas where we have had the most success. Our commercial lines gross written premiums increased by $8.4 million, or 8.9%, to $102.8 million in 2020, compared to $94.4 million in 2019. Personal lines gross written premiums increased by $1.1 million, or 14.9% to $8.6 million in 2020, compared to $7.5 million in 2019.\n\nOur recorded loss and loss adjustment expenses (\"LAE\") reserves represent management's best estimate of unpaid loss and LAE at each balance sheet date, based on information, facts and circumstances known at such time. Our loss and LAE reserves reflect our estimates at the balance sheet date of:\n (1) The loss ratio is the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of net losses and loss adjustment expenses to net earned premiums and other income from underwriting operations. The 2018 ratios have been recast to reflect the new presentation. Refer to Note 17 ~ Segment Information for further details. \nInterest expense was $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. We issued $25.3 million of public senior unsecured notes (the \"Notes\") in 2018. Proceeds from the Notes were used to pay down $19.5 million of the $30.0 million of subordinated notes that were issued in the third quarter of 2017. The Company repurchased 36,761 units of the Notes in the public market in 2020. Interest expense includes the amortization of debt issuance costs relating to the Notes which is $260,000 per annum over the 5-year life of the Notes. The interest expense relating to the amortization of debt issuance costs for the existing $10.5 million of the subordinated notes is $51,000 per annum over the 20-year life of the subordinated notes.\n\nNet realized investment gains increased by $1.1 million to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $61,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was mostly attributed to the increase in value of the Company's equity securities in 2019.\nThe $9.0 million of adverse development in 2018 consisted of $6.2 million from commercial lines and $2.8 million from personal lines and mostly related to the 2016 and 2015 accident years.\nOur expense ratio decreased by 1.9%, to 44.0% for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018. The decrease in the expense ratio was primarily due to lower operating and reinsurance costs in 2019 compared to 2018. The reduction in the expense ratio was partially offset by lower net earned premium in 2019 compared to 2018.\nOur premiums are presented below for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in thousands):\nNet losses and LAE decreased by $3.5 million, or 5.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The calendar year loss ratios were 62.8% and 66.8% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nPolicy acquisition costs are costs we incur to issue policies, which include commissions, premium taxes, underwriting reports and underwriter compensation costs. The Company offsets direct commissions with ceded commissions from reinsurers. The percentage of policy acquisition costs to net earned premiums and other income increased by 2.1%, from 28.2 in 2019 to 30.3% in 2020. The acquisition cost ratio was higher mostly due to higher ceded premium rates in 2020 compared to 2019.\nWe use adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share, in conjunction with other financial measures, to assess our performance and to evaluate the results of our business. We believe these measures provide investors with valuable information relating to our ongoing performance that may be obscured by the effect of investment gains and losses as a result of our market risk sensitive instruments, which primarily relate to fixed income securities that are available-for-sale and not held for trading purposes. Realized investment gains and losses may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by external economic developments, such as capital market conditions. Accordingly, adjusted operating income excludes the effect of items that tend to be highly variable from period to period and highlights the results from our ongoing business operations and the underlying loss or profitability of our business. We believe that it is useful for investors to evaluate adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share, along with net income and net income per share, when reviewing and evaluating our performance.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company reported $6,000 of current federal income tax expense and $0 of current state income tax expense. The Company reported a deferred tax benefit of $0 and $940,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The deferred tax benefit in 2019 was a result of the change in the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to the changes in unrealized gains. No such impact occurred in 2020. The Company in 2020 had $808,000 of taxable income, which was fully offset by the utilization of the net operating losses carried forward from previous years.\nThe Company has a $10.0 million line of credit, which it drew upon and paid down at various times throughout 2019, and which contributed to interest expense.\nSummary of Premium Revenue\nThe Company also has outstanding $10.5 million of subordinated notes maturing on September 30, 2038. The subordinated notes bear an interest rate of 7.5% per annum until September 30, 2023, and 12.5% thereafter, and allow for four quarterly interest payment deferrals. Interest is payable quarterly at the end of March, June, September and December. Beginning September 30, 2021, the Company may redeem the subordinated notes, in whole or in part, for a call premium of $1.1 million. The call premium escalates each quarter to ultimately $1.75 million on September 30, 2023, then steps up to $3.05 million on December 31, 2023, and increases quarterly at a 12.5% per annum rate thereafter.\nCommittee (which includes our Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer, other members of executive management, and key actuarial, underwriting and claims personnel) meets each quarter to review our actuaries' estimated ultimate expected loss and LAE.\nThere is a $13.6 million valuation allowance against 100% of the net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2019, which would increase book value by $1.41 per share if reversed in the future. The valuation allowance was $12.6 million as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of $60.0 million, of which $50.0 million expire in tax years 2020 through 2039 and $10.0 million never expire. Of this amount, $14.1 million are limited in the amount that can be utilized in any one year and may expire before they are realized under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company has state net operating loss carryforwards of $17.7 million, which expire in tax years 2021 through 2039.\nOur premiums are presented below for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands):\nInvestment Valuation and Impairment\nOn April 24, 2020, the Company received a $2.7 million PPP loan from the line of credit Lender pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program of the CARES Act administered by the SBA. The PPP loan was incorporated into the existing line of credit facility and utilizes a portion of the line of credit's limit. However, the PPP loan has a different maturity date (April 24, 2022) in accordance with the SBA requirements and bears interest at a rate of 1.0% per annum. The Company amended its $10.0 million line of credit facility with the Lender to incorporate this loan as a reduction of the available line of credit. The loan may be prepaid by the Company at any time prior to maturity with no prepayment penalties. This loan may be subject to forgiveness under the CARES Act provisions. The Company applied for forgiveness of the loan in 2020, at which point the principal and interest payments were deferred until the SBA remits the loan forgiveness amount to the Lender. No assumptions were made relative to potential forgiveness as of December 31, 2020.\nLosses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nPremiums\nFair values are measured in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements. The guidance establishes a framework for measuring fair value and a three-level hierarchy based upon the quality of inputs used to measure fair value. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are: (1) Level 1: inputs are based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, (2) Level 2: inputs are other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liabilities, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability and (3) Level 3: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity. The unobservable inputs represent the Company's best assumption of how market participants would price the assets or liabilities. The Company also has investment company limited partnership investments, which are measured at net asset value (NAV). The fair value of these investments is based on the capital account balances reported by the investment funds subject to their management review and adjustment. The capital account balances reflect the fair value of the investment funds.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur expense ratio is a measure of the efficiency and performance of the commercial and personal lines of business (our risk-bearing underwriting operations). It is calculated by dividing the sum of policy acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses by the sum of net earned premiums and other income of the underwriting business. Costs that cannot be readily identifiable as a direct cost of a segment or product line remain in Corporate for segment reporting purposes. The expense ratio excludes wholesale agency and Corporate expenses.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, was $25.0 million as compared to cash provided by investing activities of $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in funds used in investing activities was due to an increase in funds available to be invested in our investment portfolio in the insurance subsidiaries.\n \u2022 Case reserves, which are unpaid loss and LAE amounts that have been reported; and \nInsurance operations are subject to various leverage tests (e.g., premium-to-statutory surplus ratios), which are evaluated by regulators and rating agencies. As of December 31, 2020, on a trailing twelve-month statutory combined basis, the gross written and net written premium leverage ratios were 1.7 to 1.0 and 1.5 to 1.0, respectively.\nWe review fair value prices provided by our outside investment managers for reasonableness by comparing the fair values provided by the managers to those provided by our investment custodian. We also review and monitor changes in unrealized gains and losses. We obtain an understanding of the methods, models and inputs used by our investment managers and independent pricing services, and controls are in place to validate that prices provided represent fair values. Our control process includes initial and ongoing evaluation of the methodologies used, a review of specific securities and an assessment for proper classification within the fair value hierarchy.\nThe following table displays ultimate net loss and LAE and net loss and LAE reserves by accident year for the year ended December 31, 2020. We applied the sensitivity factors to each accident year amount and have calculated the amount of potential net loss and LAE reserve change and the impact on 2020 reported pre-tax income and on net income and shareholders' equity at December 31, 2020. We believe it is not appropriate to sum the illustrated amounts as it is not reasonably likely that each accident year's reserve estimate assumptions will vary simultaneously in the same direction to the full extent of the sensitivity factor. We also believe that such changes to our reserve balance would not have a material impact on our operating results, financial position, or liquidity. The net income and shareholders' equity amounts include an income tax rate assumption of 21%. The dollar amounts in the table are in thousands.\n (1) The estimated unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense payments were made using estimates based on historical payment patterns. However, future payments may be different than historical payment patterns. \n\nThe fair values of debt and equity securities have been determined using fair value prices provided by our investment managers, who utilize internationally recognized independent pricing services. The prices provided by the independent pricing services are generally based on observable market data in active markets (e.g., broker quotes and prices observed for comparable securities).\n \u2022 Paid and reported losses and LAE; \n\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\n \u2022 Any other information considered pertinent to estimating the indemnity and expense exposure presented by the claim. \nThere is a $13.3 million valuation allowance against 100% of the net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2020, which would increase book value by $1.37 per share if reversed in the future. The valuation allowance was $13.6 million as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of $59.2 million, of which $49.3 million expire in tax years 2028 through 2039 and $9.9 million never expire. Of this amount, $14.1 million are limited in the amount that can be utilized in any one year and may expire before they are realized under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company has state net operating loss carryforwards of $17.1 million, which expire in tax years 2021 through 2040.\n\nCase reserves are initially set by our claims personnel. When a claim is reported to us, our claims department completes a case-basis valuation and establishes a case reserve for the estimated amount of the probable ultimate losses and LAE associated with that claim. Our claims department updates their case-basis valuations upon receipt of additional information and reduces case reserves as claims are paid. The case reserve is based primarily upon an evaluation of the following factors:\nOther Income\n (1) The loss ratio is the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of net losses and loss adjustment expenses to net earned premiums and other income from underwriting operations. \nInvestment Income\n \u2022 Frequency/severity method-This method projects claim counts and average cost per claim on a paid or reported basis for high frequency, low severity products. \nRefer to Note 1 ~ Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: Recently Issued Accounting Guidance of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed information.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company reported $0 of current federal income tax expense and $27,000 of current state income tax expense. The Company reported a deferred tax benefit of $940,000 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in the deferred tax benefit in 2019 was a result of the change in the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to the changes in unrealized gains.\n\nWe do not discount the loss and LAE reserves for the time value of money.\n\nAdjusted operating loss, a non-GAAP measure, was $8.0 million, or $0.83 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to an adjusted operating loss of $15.1 million, or $1.69 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n \u2022 Loss development methods-Loss development methods assume that the losses and LAE yet to emerge for an accident year are proportional to the paid or reported loss and LAE amounts observed to-date. The paid loss development method uses losses and LAE paid to date, while the reported loss development method uses losses and LAE reported to date; \nThe carrying value of our gross deferred tax asset for the NOL carryforwards is equal to the total NOL carryforward amount times the applicable federal and state tax rates, and was $13.3 million and $13.5 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Total gross deferred tax assets were $17.2 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. A valuation allowance of $13.3 million and $13.6 million has been recorded against the gross deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as the Company has recognized a three-year cumulative loss as of December 31, 2020 which is significant negative evidence to support the lack of recoverability of those deferred tax assets in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. If the $13.3 million valuation allowance as of December 31, 2020 were reversed in the future, it would increase book value by $1.37 per share. The net deferred tax liabilities were zero as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n \u2022 Written and earned premiums; \nThrough our personal insurance lines, we offer homeowners insurance and dwelling fire insurance products to individuals in several states. Our specialty homeowners insurance product line is primarily comprised of low-value dwelling\nOperating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $3.0 million, compared to $15.4 million for the same period in 2019. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a $6.0 million increase in paid claims, a decrease of $3.0 million of cash received from agencies, and a $2.1 million decrease in cash received under certain fronting arrangements. These reductions in cash flow provided by operating activities were partially offset by a $3.1 million increase in premiums collected, net of reinsurance premiums.\nOur loss and LAE reserves do not represent an exact measurement of liability, but are estimates. The most significant assumptions affecting our IBNR reserve estimates are the loss development factors applied to paid losses and case reserves to develop IBNR by line of business and accident year. Although historical loss development provides us with an indication of future loss development, it typically varies from year to year. Thus, for each accident year within each line of business we select one loss development factor out of a range of historical factors.\n\nThe tables below detail our losses and LAE and loss ratios for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in thousands).\nNet realized investment gains increased by $6.9 million, or 579%, to $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was attributed to the company harvesting gains from the increase in value of its bond portfolio in 2020. The Company also experienced gains in its equity securities with the market increasing in value during the second half of 2020. Some of these equity gains were realized upon sale.\nWe generated a sensitivity analysis of our net reserves which represents reasonably likely levels of variability in our selected loss development factors. We believe the most meaningful approach to the sensitivity analysis is to vary the loss development factors that drive the ultimate loss and LAE estimates. We applied this approach on an accident year basis, reflecting the reasonably likely differences in variability by level of maturity of the underlying loss experience for each accident year. Generally, the most recent accident years are characterized by more unreported losses and less information available for settling claims, and have more inherent uncertainty than the reserve estimates for more mature accident years. Therefore, we used variability factors of plus or minus 10% for the most recent accident year, 5% for the preceding accident year, and 2.5% for the second preceding accident year. There is minimal expected variability for accident years at four or more years' maturity.\nOur actuaries estimate an IBNR reserve for our unallocated LAE not specifically identified to a particular claim, namely our internal claims department salaries and associated general overhead and administrative expenses associated with the adjustment and processing of claims. These estimates, which are referred to as unallocated loss adjustment expense (\"ULAE\") reserves, are based on internal cost studies and analyses reflecting the relationship of ULAE paid to actual paid and incurred losses. We select factors that are applied to case reserves and IBNR reserve estimates in order to estimate the amount of ULAE reserves applicable to estimated loss reserves at the balance sheet date.\nWe believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and investment securities balances will be adequate to meet our capital and liquidity needs and the needs of our subsidiaries on a short-term and long-term basis.\nNet written premiums decreased $1.4 million, or 1.5%, to $87.7 million, for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $89.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to the reduction in the commercial lines business.\nThe table below provides the expense ratio by major component:\nThe Company has a $10.0 million line of credit, which it drew upon and paid down at various times throughout 2020, and which contributed to interest expense.\nThe Company received a one-time dividend from an investment for $213,000 in the third quarter of 2019.\n (3) The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. A combined ratio under 100% indicates an underwriting profit. A combined ratio over 100% indicates an underwriting loss. \nExpense Ratio\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n \u2022 Bornheutter-Ferguson method-This method is a combination of the loss ratio and loss development methods, where the loss development factor is given more weight as an accident year matures; and \n \u2022 Incurred but not reported (\"IBNR\") reserves, which are (1) unpaid loss and LAE amounts that have been incurred but not yet reported; and (2) the expected development on case reserves. \nThe tables below detail our losses and LAE and loss ratios for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands).\nThe forward-looking statements contained in this report are based on management's good-faith belief and reasonable judgment based on current information. The forward-looking statements are qualified by important factors, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including those described above in Item 1A Risk Factors and subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the SEC. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this report speaks only as of the date hereof or as of the date specified herein. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by any applicable laws or regulations.\nGross written premiums increased by $9.5 million, or 9.3%, to $111.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $101.9 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was attributable to an increase in written premium in our small business programs, which was slightly offset by a decrease in written premium in our hospitality programs.\n (3) The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. A combined ratio under 100% indicates an underwriting profit. A combined ratio over 100% indicates an underwriting loss. \nOur revenues are primarily derived from premiums earned from our insurance operations. We also generate other revenues through investment income and other income which mainly consists of: installment fees and policy issuance fees generally related to the policies we write.\nSummary Operating Results\n\nAdjusted Operating Income (Loss) and Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) Per Share\n\nCash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, was $15.4 million as compared to cash used in operating activities of $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $32.4 million increase in cash from operations was mostly due to a $28.4 million increase in cash received from reinsurers due to ceded losses, including $12.5 million of cash received in 2019 from the ADC. Also, ceded premiums paid to reinsurers decreased by $2.6 million in 2019 compared to 2018.\nWe measure the performance of our consolidated results, in part, based on our underwriting gain or loss. The following table provides the underwriting gain or loss for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in thousands):\n \u2022 Expected claim reporting and payout patterns based on our own loss experience and supplemented with insurance industry data where applicable. \nOther Income\n (2) Includes estimated future payments under the software license agreement relating to our policy issuance system. This agreement requires minimum monthly payments of $30,000, and is variable with premium volume. The future payment assumptions are based on the minimum monthly payments. The software license agreement expires on September 30, 2022. \nOur reserves consist entirely of reserves for property and liability losses, consistent with the coverages provided for in the insurance policies directly written or assumed by us under reinsurance contracts. Several years may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to us and our payment of the loss. The level of IBNR reserves in relation to total reserves depends upon the characteristics of the specific line of business, particularly related to the speed with which claims are reported and outstanding claims are paid. Lines of business for which claims are reported slowly will have a higher percentage of IBNR reserves than lines of business that report and settle claims more quickly.\nWe contributed $1.2 million to our Insurance Company Subsidiaries in 2020. We contributed $3.9 million to our Insurance Company Subsidiaries in 2019. No contributions to our Insurance Company Subsidiaries were made in 2018. We believe that the current statutory surplus levels and the funds available at the holding company level will provide the necessary statutory capital to support our premium volume growth over the next two years.\ninsurance tailored for owners of lower valued homes, which we offer in Illinois, Indiana and Texas. Due to ongoing Florida-based industry events, we have been de-emphasizing our Florida homeowners' business and reducing our exposures in that state, as well as other wind-exposed states like Texas and Hawaii.\nResults of Operations - 2020 Compared to 2019\nThe impact from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma continued to recede in 2020. Loss development on Hurricane Harvey was $89,000 in 2020 compared to $313,000 in 2019. Catastrophe reinstatement costs from Irma were $195,000 in 2020, compared to $495,000 in 2019.\nInvesting Activities. Cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, was $7.3 million and $25.0 million, respectively. The $17.7M increase in the use of cash from investing activities over the prior year is due to increased activity across the Company's investment portfolio to take advantage of 2020 market conditions.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\n \u2022 The jurisdiction of the occurrence; \nThrough our commercial insurance lines, we offer coverage for both commercial property and commercial liability. We also offer coverage for commercial automobiles and workers' compensation. Our insurance policies are sold to targeted small and mid-sized businesses on a single or multiple-coverage basis.\nThrough our wholesale agency business segment, we offer commercial and personal lines insurance products for our Insurance Company Subsidiaries as well as third-party insurers. We have expanded the wholesale agency business to develop more non-risk revenue streams, and to provide our agents with more insurance product options.\nOur income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous state jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the consolidated income tax expense.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have federal and state income tax net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) carryforwards of $59.2 million and $17.1 million, respectively. Of the NOL carryforwards, $49.3 million will expire in tax years 2028 through 2039 and $9.9 million will never expire. Of the federal NOL amount, $14.1 million are subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. These net NOL carryforwards are limited in the amount that can be utilized in any one year and may expire before they are realized. At this time we do not expect that any of the remaining NOL carryforwards will expire before utilized.\nIn 2018, the Company recognized a measurement period adjustment of $42,735 related to loss reserve discounting, which reduced deferred tax expense. The Company also recognized a measurement period adjustment of $42,735 related to the loss reserve discounting transitional adjustment, which increased deferred tax expense. The measurement period adjustments were based upon obtaining additional information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the enactment date that, if known, would have affected the income tax effects initially reported as provisional amounts under the Act. The measurement period adjustments had no effect on the effective tax rate for the year ending December 31, 2018. The accounting for the income tax effects of the Act pursuant to SAB 118 has been completed as of the end of the December 22, 2018, measurement period and for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nPremiums are earned ratably over the term of the policy, whereas written premiums are reflected on the effective date of the policy. Almost all commercial lines and homeowners products have annual policies, under which premiums are earned evenly over one year. The resulting net earned premiums are impacted by the gross and ceded written premiums, earned ratably over the terms of the policies.\n \u2022 Actuarial projections of what we, at a given time, expect to be the cost of the ultimate settlement and administration of claims reflecting facts and circumstances then known; \nPolicy acquisition costs are costs we incur to issue policies, which include commissions, premium taxes, underwriting reports and underwriter compensation costs. The Company offsets direct commissions with ceded commissions from reinsurers. The percentage of policy acquisition costs to net earned premiums and other income decreased by 1.0%, from 29.2% in 2018, to 28.2% in 2019.\nThe Company's commercial lines experienced low claims activity during 2020 due to COVID-19. While substantially all businesses maintained their insurance, liability losses were lower as restaurants, bars, and other small businesses were required to limit business or totally shut down for a period of time. This reduced the potential to incur liability losses and contributed to the lower current accident year loss ratio. Potential exposures to COVID-19 losses were minimal as we include strict exclusions to business interruption coverage related to bacterial or viral causes on most policies and require physical property damage for the business interruption coverage to be effective on all policies. We also do not provide coverage relating to event cancellations, travel insurance or other coverages that could directly generate such losses. We believe we also have limited exposures relating to our workers compensation coverages which are generally companion coverages with our existing commercial policies, which represents a small amount of our overall premiums and does not appear to be heavily exposed to COVID-19-related losses.\nInterest Expense\n* Percentage change is not meaningful\nThe Company reported net income of $595,000, or $0.06 per share, in 2020, compared to a net loss of $7.8 million, or $0.88 per share, in 2019.\nGross written premiums decreased by $2.5 million, or 2.4%, to $101.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $104.4 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was attributable to a reduction in written premium in our hospitality programs, which was slightly offset by an increase in written premium in our small business programs.\nWe carry debt securities classified as available-for-sale at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses on such securities, net of any deferred taxes, are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Our equity securities that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method are measured at fair value and any changes in fair value are recognized in net income. We carry other equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value at cost, less impairment and adjusted for observable price changes under the measurement alternative provided under GAAP. We review these investments for impairment during each reporting period. We do not have any securities classified as trading or held-to-maturity.\nSources and Uses of Funds\nCommercial lines gross written premiums decreased $3.3 million, or 3.4%, to $94.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $97.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our hospitality programs' gross written premiums decreased $6.6 million, or 12.0%, to $48.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $55.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. However, gross written premiums for our small business programs increased by $3.3 million, or 7.7%, to $46.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $42.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nInterest expense was $2.9 million and $2.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We issued $25.3 million of Notes in 2018. Proceeds from the Notes were used to pay down $19.5 million of the $30.0 million of subordinated notes that were issued in the third quarter of 2017. Interest expense includes the amortization of debt issuance costs relating to the new Notes which is $260,000 per annum over the 5-year life of the Notes. The interest expense relating to the amortization of debt issuance costs for the existing $10.5 million of the subordinated notes is $50,000 per annum over the 20-year life of the subordinated notes.\nThe $15.6 million of adverse development in 2020 consisted of $15.2 million from commercial lines and $352,000 from personal lines and mostly related to the 2018 and 2017 accident years.\n \u2022 Our knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the claim; \nWe are aware that our outstanding debt securities are currently trading at a discount to their face amount. In order to reduce future cash interest payments, as well as future amounts due at maturity or upon redemption, we may, from time to time, purchase such debt for cash, in exchange for common stock, or for a combination of cash and common stock, in open market or privately negotiated transactions. We will evaluate any such transactions in light of then-existing market conditions, taking into account our current liquidity and prospects for future access to capital. The amounts involved in such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material.\nWe consider a number of factors in assessing whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, including (1) the amount and percentage that current fair value is below cost or amortized cost, (2) the length of time that the fair value has been below cost or amortized cost and (3) recent corporate developments or other factors that may impact an issuer's near term prospects. In addition, for debt securities, we consider the credit quality ratings for the securities, with a special emphasis on securities downgraded to below investment grade. We also consider our intent to sell available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, and if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before a recovery in fair value to their cost or amortized cost basis.\nPremiums are earned ratably over the term of the policy, whereas written premiums are reflected on the effective date of the policy. Almost all commercial lines and homeowners products have annual policies, under which premiums are earned evenly over one year. The resulting net earned premiums are impacted by the gross and ceded written premiums, earned ratably over the terms of the policies.", "item_7_tables": "Table 113: <table> <tr> <td> Line of

The combined ratio improved to 108.4% in 2020 from 110.8% in 2019.\n\n- Investment Income: Net investment income decreased 21.7% in 2020 compared to 2019 due to lower interest rates. \n\n- Net Income: The company reported net income of $595K in 2020 compared to a net loss of $7.8M in 2019, primarily due to realized investment gains of $8.1M in 2020. Adjusted operating loss was $8M in 2020 vs $15.1M in 2019.\n\n- Loss Reserves: Adverse development was $15.6M in 2020 compared to $10.6M in 2019, relating mainly to the 2018 and 2017 accident years. \n\n- Liquidity: The company has $21.5M in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and believes this is adequate to meet liquidity needs.\n\nIn summary, the company improved underwriting performance but continues to report adjusted operating losses.
