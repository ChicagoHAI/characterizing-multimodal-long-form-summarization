Additionally, we were disappointed with our fourth quarter peak season for the second consecutive year. In addition to managing our operating costs, we continue to evaluate the most effective level of participation in the peak season and the manner of allocating our assets and coordinating third party capacity. We remain committed to providing peak capacity for our customers; however, we will need to challenge our pricing models to ensure we are appropriately rewarded for our efforts related to this valuable annual shipping period.\nWe are encouraged by our continued profitability and we continue to focus on our turnaround efforts at SRT, which realized a more than a 400 basis point improvement in its operating margin compared to 2016. We are also continuing to deleverage our balance sheet, resulting in total indebtedness, net of cash and including the present value of off-balance sheet lease obligations, decreasing approximately $6.6 million since December 31, 2016. Additionally, earnings included the approximately $40.1 million favorable effective tax rate impact from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and the reduced negative impact of the fuel hedges have increased tangible book value per basic share 24.4% to $16.11 from $12.95 at December 31, 2016.\nOur annual operating ratio deteriorated 80 basis points to 96.0%. Our adjusted operating ratio (as defined below), a key measure of profitability in our industry, also deteriorated 80 basis points to a 95.5%. These unfavorable changes were primarily the result of the significantly more expensive third-party capacity during the latter portion of the year, affecting our Managed Freight and Truckload segments, as well as increased employee wages and increased capital costs compared to 2016. Our consolidated financial results are summarized as follows:\nTable 34: <table> <tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Total revenue was $705.0 million, compared with $670.7 million for 2016, and freight revenue (which excludes revenue from fuel surcharges) was $626.8 million, compared with $610.8 million for 2016;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Operating income was $28.1 million, compared with operating income of $32.4 million for 2016;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Net income was $55.4 million, or $3.02 per diluted share, compared with net income of $16.8 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, for 2016;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Our equity investment in TEL provided $3.4 million of pre-tax earnings in 2017, compared to $3.0 million for 2016; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Stockholders' equity and tangible book value at December 31, 2017, were $295.2 million, or $16.11 per basic share.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to operating ratio, we use \"adjusted operating ratio\" as a key measure of profitability. Adjusted operating ratio means operating expenses, net of fuel surcharge revenue, expressed as a percentage of revenue, excluding fuel surcharge revenue. Adjusted operating ratio is not a substitute for operating ratio measured in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the use of adjusted operating ratio allows us to more effectively compare periods, while excluding the potentially volatile effect of changes in fuel prices. Our Board and management focus on our adjusted operating ratio as an indicator of our performance from period to period. We believe our presentation of adjusted operating ratio is useful because it provides investors and securities analysts the same information that we use internally to assess our core operating performance. Although we believe that adjusted operating ratio improves comparability in analyzing our period-to-period performance, it could limit comparability to other companies in our industry, if those companies define adjusted operating ratio differently. Because of these limitations, adjusted operating ratio should not be considered a measure of income generated by our business or discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures on a supplemental basis.\nOperating Ratio\nTable 35: <table> <tr> <td> Operating Ratio ( OR\u201d) From 2015 to 2017\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GAAP Operating Ratio:\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> OR %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> OR %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> OR %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 705,007\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 670,651\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 724,240\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 676,852\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 96.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 638,204\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 95.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 656,458\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 90.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,155\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,447\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67,782\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted Operating Ratio:\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Adj.

We believe the combination of an improving economy, tightening truckload supply dynamics, industry regulatory changes including the ELD mandate and its enforcement, depleting inventories, year-over-year net fuel expense savings from our improved fuel hedge positions, and further operational progress at SRT should deliver increased pre-tax earnings for the full year of 2018. In addition, we expect earnings improvement from the estimated favorable effective tax rate impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. We are currently estimating our 2018 effective income tax rate to be in the range of 24.0% to 27.0%. We expect year-over-year average freight revenue per truck to be positive by a mid-to-high single digit percentage, inflecting more positively later in the year as a large portion of annual contractual rate revisions are implemented during the second quarter of 2018. Our expectation of positive year-over-year pretax income includes higher employee wages for each quarter of 2018 versus comparable 2017 quarters. We also expect a decline in the operating income of our non-asset based logistics service offering to partially offset the forecasted operating income improvement for our Truckload service offering. Within the non-asset based logistics service offering, we expect some margin deterioration resulting from higher purchased transportation expense, coupled with planned investments in strategic employees and a new transport management system designed to enhance our supply chain services and growth potential. From a balance sheet perspective, with net capital expenditures scheduled to be below normal due to the timing of our expected replacement cycle, along with anticipated positive operating cash flows, we expect to further reduce combined balance sheet and off-balance sheet debt over the course of fiscal 2018.\nRESULTS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth total revenue and freight revenue (total revenue less fuel surcharge revenue) for the periods indicated:\nRevenue\nTable 36: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 626,809\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 610,845\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 640,120\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fuel surcharge revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 78,198\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 59,806\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 84,120\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 705,007\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 670,651\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 724,240\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2017, total revenue increased $34.4 million, or 5.1%, to $705.0 million from $670.7 million in 2016. Freight revenue increased $16.0 million, or 2.6%, to $626.8 million for 2017, from $610.8 million in 2016, while fuel surcharge revenue increased $18.4 million year-over-year. The increase in freight revenue resulted from a $22.8 million increase in revenues from Managed Freight, partially offset by a $6.8 million decrease in freight revenue from our Truckload segment.\nThe decrease in 2017 Truckload revenue relates to a $4.2 million decrease in freight revenue contributed by our temperature-controlled intermodal service offering, a decrease in our average tractor fleet of 1.4% from 2016, partially offset by an increase in average freight revenue per tractor per week of 0.9% compared to 2016. The increase in average freight revenue per tractor per week is the result of a 2.1% increase, or 3.6 cents per mile, in average rate per total mile, partially offset by a 1.4% decrease in average miles per unit when compared to 2016. Team driven units decreased approximately 11.6% to an average of 912 teams in 2017 from 1,032 teams in 2016.\nThe increase in Managed Freight revenue is primarily as a result of spot market opportunities related to the hurricane-affected regions during 2017 and growth with existing customers compared with the same 2016 periods.\nFor 2016, total revenue decreased $53.6 million, or 7.4%, to $670.7 million from $724.2 million in 2015. Freight revenue decreased $29.3 million, or 4.6%, to $610.8 million for 2016, from $640.1 million in 2015, while fuel surcharge revenue decreased $24.3 million year-over-year. The decrease in freight revenue resulted from a $30.4 million decrease in freight revenue from our Truckload segment, partially offset by a $1.1 million increase in revenues from Managed Freight.\nThe decrease in 2016 Truckload revenue relates to a decrease in average freight revenue per tractor per week of 2.2% compared to 2015 and a decrease in our average tractor fleet of 3.9% from 2015, partially offset by a $1.7 million increase in freight revenue contributed by our temperature-controlled intermodal service offering. The decrease in average freight revenue per tractor per week is the result of a 1.3% decrease, or 2.2 cents per mile, in average rate per total mile and a 0.6% decrease in average miles per unit when compared to 2015. Team driven units increased approximately 5.3% to an average of approximately 1,000 teams in 2016 from approximately 950 teams in 2015.\nThe increase in Managed Freight revenue is primarily the result of improved coordination with our Truckload segment, additional business from new customers added during the year, and the full year effect of a large customer added in 2015.\nIf capacity tightens as a result of regulations impacting the industry or economic growth, we expect the pricing environment to improve into 2018 and 2019, offset in part by higher driver pay and other inflationary costs. Further, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we exited the temperature-controlled intermodal business, which provided $11.0 million of total revenue in 2017, in order to focus on our objective to continue improvements at SRT, which could result in more muted revenue growth at SRT.\nFor comparison purposes in the discussion below, we use total revenue and freight revenue (total revenue less fuel surcharge revenue) when discussing changes as a percentage of revenue. As it relates to the comparison of expenses to freight revenue, we believe removing fuel surcharge revenue, which is sometimes a volatile source of revenue, affords a more consistent basis for comparing the results of operations from period-to-period. Nonetheless, freight revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not a substitute for revenue measured in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures. Our Board and management focus on our freight revenue as an indicator of our performance from period to period. We believe our presentation of freight revenue is useful because it provides investors and securities analysts the same information that we use internally to assess our core operating performance. Although we believe that freight revenue improves comparability in analyzing our period-to-period performance, it could limit comparability to other companies in our industry, if those companies define freight revenue differently. Because of these limitations, freight revenue should not be considered a measure of total revenue generated by or available to our business. Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures on a supplemental basis.\nSalaries, wages, and related expenses\nTable 37: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Salaries, wages, and related expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 241,784\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 234,526\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 244,779\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 34.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 33.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 38.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 38.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 38.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSalaries, wages, and related expenses increased approximately $7.3 million, or 3.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 2016. As a percentage of total revenue, salaries, wages, and related expenses decreased to 34.3% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 35.0% in 2016. As a percentage of freight revenue, salaries, wages, and related expenses increased slightly to 38.6% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 38.4% in 2016. The change in salaries, wages, and related expenses is primarily due to pay adjustments for both driver and non-drivers since 2016 and an increase in non-driver incentive compensation. Additionally, fees paid to third party agents increased $1.1 million as a result of improved Managed Freight revenue and workers' compensation costs increased approximately 0.4 cents per mile as compared to the historic lows of 2016.\nSalaries, wages, and related expenses decreased approximately $10.3 million, or 4.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, salaries, wages, and related expenses increased to 35.0% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 33.8% in 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, salaries, wages, and related expenses increased slightly to 38.4% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 38.2% in 2015. Salaries, wages, and related expenses decreased significantly on an overall dollar basis as a result of a 3.9% decrease in average tractors, but were relatively flat as a percentage of freight revenue, primarily due to pay adjustments for both driver and non-drivers since 2015, partially offset by a decrease in non-driver incentive compensation as a result of reduced profitability in 2016 versus 2015. Additionally, group insurance costs decreased approximately $2.3 million from 2015 as a result of better claims experience.\nGoing forward, we believe salaries, wages, and related expenses will increase as a result of a tight driver market, wage inflation, higher healthcare costs, and, in certain periods, increased incentive compensation due to better performance. In particular, we expect driver pay to increase as we look to reduce the number of unseated tractors in our fleet in a tight market for drivers. Additionally, when the freight market allows for an increase in rates we would expect to, as we have historically, pass a portion of those rate increases on to our professional drivers. Salaries, wages, and related expenses will fluctuate to some extent based on the percentage of revenue generated by owner operators and our Managed Freight segment, for which payments are reflected in the purchased transportation line item.\nFuel expense\nTable 38: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fuel expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 103,139\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 103,108\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 122,160\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 14.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 16.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe receive a fuel surcharge on our loaded miles from most shippers; however, this does not cover the entire increase in fuel prices for several reasons, including the following: surcharges cover only loaded miles we operate; surcharges do not cover miles driven out-of-route by our drivers; and surcharges typically do not cover refrigeration unit fuel usage or fuel burned by tractors while idling. Moreover, most of our business relating to shipments obtained from freight brokers does not carry a fuel surcharge. Finally, fuel surcharges vary in the percentage of reimbursement offered, and not all surcharges fully compensate for fuel price increases even on loaded miles.\nThe rate of fuel price changes also can have an impact on results. Most fuel surcharges are based on the average fuel price as published by the DOE for the week prior to the shipment, meaning we typically bill customers in the current week based on the previous week's applicable index. Therefore, in times of increasing fuel prices, we do not recover as much as we are currently paying for fuel. In periods of declining prices, the opposite is true. Fuel prices as measured by the DOE averaged approximately $0.35 cents per gallon higher in 2017 than 2016 and $0.40 cents per gallon lower in 2016 than 2015.\nAdditionally, $4.1 million, $16.7 million, and $15.3 million were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to our results from operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, as additional fuel expense for 2017, 2016 and 2015, related to losses on fuel hedge contracts that expired. We previously evaluated these contracts for \"hedge effectiveness,\" which is the extent to which the hedge contract effectively offsets changes in cash flows that the contract was intended to offset. At December 31, 2017, all fuel hedge contracts were deemed to be effective and thus continue to qualify as cash flow hedges. As a result of our early adoption of ASU 2017-12, we are no longer required to measure or record hedge ineffectiveness.\nTo measure the effectiveness of our fuel surcharge program, we subtract fuel surcharge revenue (other than the fuel surcharge revenue we reimburse to owner operators and other third parties, which is included in purchased transportation) from our fuel expense. The result is referred to as net fuel expense. Our net fuel expense as a percentage of freight revenue is affected by the cost of diesel fuel net of fuel surcharge collection, the percentage of miles driven by company tractors, our fuel economy, and our percentage of deadhead miles, for which we do not receive material fuel surcharge revenues. Net fuel expense is shown below:\nTable 39: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total fuel surcharge\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 78,198\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 59,806\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 84,120\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Fuel surcharge revenue reimbursed to owner operators and other third parties\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,997\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,250\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,790\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Company fuel surcharge revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 70,201\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 53,556\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 76,330\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total fuel expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 103,139\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 103,108\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 122,160\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Company fuel surcharge revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 70,201\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 53,556\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 76,330\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net fuel expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,938\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 49,552\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,830\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal fuel expense remained flat for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 2016. As a percentage of total revenue, total fuel expense decreased to 14.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 15.4% in 2016. As a percentage of freight revenue, total fuel expense decreased to 16.5% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 16.9% in 2016. These increases primarily related to higher fuel prices in 2017, offset by net losses from fuel hedging transactions of $4.1 million in 2017 compared to $16.7 million in 2016.\nNet fuel expense decreased $16.6 million, or 33.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. As a percentage of freight revenue, net fuel expense decreased 2.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. These decreases primarily resulted from higher fuel surcharge recovery as a result of decreased broker freight and the tiered reimbursement structure of certain fuel surcharge agreements. The decreases were partially offset by a greater percentage of miles driven by owner operators, where we pay a rate that reflects then-existing fuel prices and we do not have the natural hedge created by fuel surcharge.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, total fuel expense decreased approximately $19.1 million, or 15.6%, compared with 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, total fuel expense decreased to 15.4% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 16.9% in 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, total fuel expense decreased to 16.9% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 19.1% in 2015. These decreases primarily related to lower fuel prices and an increase in our average fuel miles per gallon during 2016 as a result of purchasing equipment with more fuel-efficient engines. The decreases were partially offset by increased net losses from fuel hedging transactions of $16.7 million in 2016 compared to $13.9 million in 2015.\nNet fuel expense increased $3.7 million, or 8.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, net fuel expense increased 0.9% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015. These increases primarily resulted from lower fuel surcharge recovery as a result of increased broker freight and the tiered reimbursement structure of certain fuel surcharge agreements. The increases were partially offset by improved miles per gallon due to new engine technology, internal fuel efficiency initiatives, and a greater percentage of miles driven by owner operators, where we pay a rate that reflects then-existing fuel prices and we do not have the natural hedge created by fuel surcharge.\nWe expect to continue managing our idle time and tractor speeds, investing in more fuel-efficient tractors to improve our miles per gallon, locking in fuel hedges when deemed appropriate, and partnering with customers to adjust fuel surcharge programs that are inadequate to recover a fair portion of fuel costs. Going forward, our net fuel expense is expected to fluctuate as a percentage of revenue based on factors such as diesel fuel prices, percentage recovered from fuel surcharge programs, percentage of uncompensated miles, percentage of revenue generated by team-driven tractors (which tend to generate higher miles and lower revenue per mile, thus proportionately more fuel cost as a percentage of revenue), percentage of revenue generated by refrigerated operation (which uses diesel fuel for refrigeration, but usually does not recover fuel surcharges on refrigeration fuel), percentage of revenue generated from owner operators, the success of fuel efficiency initiatives, and gains and losses on fuel hedging contracts.\nGiven recent historical lows, we would expect diesel fuel prices to increase over the next few years. We are continuing our efforts to increase our ability to recover fuel surcharges under our customer contracts for fuel used in refrigeration units. If these efforts are successful, it could give rise to an increase in fuel surcharges recovered and a corresponding decrease in net fuel expense. Also, due to hedging contracts being locked in at a fixed rate on a portion of the fuel gallons we expect to use in 2018, we expect net fuel expense to decline in 2018 if fuel prices remain flat or increase. We do not currently have fuel hedging contracts for periods beyond 2018.\nOperations and maintenance\nTable 40: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operations and maintenance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48,774\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,864\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 46,458\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperations and maintenance increased $2.9 million, or 6.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 2016. As a percentage of total revenue, operations and maintenance remained relatively flat at 6.9% of total revenue in 2017, compared with 6.8% in 2016. As a percentage of freight revenue, operations and maintenance increased to 7.8% of freight revenue for 2017, from 7.5% in 2016, primarily due to extending the trade cycle of our tractors in the second half of 2016, as well as unloading and other operational costs associated with our increase in dedicated freight that was added since the first quarter of 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, operations and maintenance decreased $0.6 million, or 1.3%, compared with 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, operations and maintenance remained relatively flat at 6.8% of total revenue in 2016, compared with 6.4% in 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, operations and maintenance increased to 7.5% of freight revenue for 2016, from 7.3% in 2015 due to an increase in unloading and other operational costs associated with our increase in dedicated freight, partially offset by lower maintenance cost on our revenue equipment.\nGoing forward, we believe this category will fluctuate based on several factors, including our continued ability to maintain a relatively young fleet, accident severity and frequency, weather, and the reliability of new and untested revenue equipment models.\nRevenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation\nTable 41: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 141,954\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 117,472\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 118,583\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 20.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 17.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 16.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 22.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 19.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 18.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased approximately $24.5 million, or 20.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 2016. As a percentage of total revenue, revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased to 20.1% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 17.5% in 2016. As a percentage of freight revenue, revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased to 22.6% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 19.2% in 2016. These changes were primarily the result of a $19.8 million increase in payments to third-party transportation providers primarily related to increased revenues for our Managed Freight segment and the increased need for outside capacity to meet the demands of peak season for our Truckload services. Additionally, the percentage of the total miles run by owner-operators increased from 9.7% for 2016 to 10.3% for 2017. These increases were partially offset by reduced expenses resulting from a reduction and subsequent elimination of our temperature-controlled intermodal service offering.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation decreased approximately $1.1 million, or 0.9%, compared with 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased to 17.5% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 16.4% in 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased to 19.2% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 18.5% in 2015. These changes were primarily the result of a $0.7 million increase in payments to third-party transportation providers related to increased revenues for our Managed Freight segment and growth of our temperature-controlled intermodal service offering. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in leased equipment rental payments due to a reduction in our trailers under operating leases from 2,239 at December 31, 2015 to 1,695 at December 31, 2016. We expect revenue equipment rentals to decrease going forward as a result of our increase in acquisition of revenue equipment through financed purchases or capital leases rather than operating leases. As discussed below, this decrease may be partially or fully offset by an increase in purchased transportation as we expect to continue to grow our Managed Freight segment.\nWe expect purchased transportation to increase as we seek to grow our Managed Freight segment. In addition, if fuel prices continue to increase, it would result in a further increase in what we pay third party carriers and owner operators. However, this expense category will fluctuate with the number and percentage of loads hauled by owner operators, loads handled by Managed Freight, and tractors, trailers, and other assets financed with operating leases. In addition, factors such as the cost to obtain third party transportation services, and growth of our intermodal service offerings, and the amount of fuel surcharge revenue passed through to the third party carriers and owner operators will affect this expense category. If industry-wide trucking capacity were to tighten in relation to freight demand, we may need to increase the amounts we pay to third-party transportation providers, owner operators, and intermodal transportation providers, which could increase this expense category on an absolute basis and as a percentage of freight revenue absent an offsetting increase in revenue. We continue to actively recruit owner operators and, if we are successful, we would expect this line item to increase as a percentage of revenue. Further, we exited the temperature-controlled intermodal business in the fourth quarter of 2017 in order to focus on our objective to continue improvements at SRT. As a result, we expect purchased transportation costs at SRT to decrease going forward, which could partially offset any increase in consolidated purchased transportation.\nOperating taxes and licenses\nTable 42: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating taxes and licenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,878\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,712\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,016\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating taxes and licenses decreased approximately $1.8 million, or 15.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 2016.

As a percentage of freight revenue, operating taxes and licenses decreased to 1.6% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 1.9% in 2016. The decrease in operating taxes and licenses, including as a percentage of total revenue and freight revenue, is primarily due to the settlement of a property tax matter that resulted in a decrease of a prior year's assessment and related refund, as well as a lower truck count.\nFor the 2016 year compared to 2015, the change in operating taxes and licenses was not significant as either a percentage of total revenue or freight revenue.\nInsurance and claims\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Insurance and claims\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,155\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,596\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31,909\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInsurance and claims, consisting primarily of premiums and deductible amounts for liability, physical damage, and cargo damage insurance and claims, increased approximately $0.6 million, or 1.7%, for year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 2016.

As a percentage of freight revenue, insurance and claims remained flat at 5.3% of freight revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The change in total revenue resulted from increased accident severity early in 2017, partially offset by an 8.2% improvement in DOT reportable accidents per million miles driven for the 2017 year. Total insurance cost increased to 10.7 cents per mile for 2017 from 10.3 cents per mile in 2016.\nInsurance and claims increased approximately $0.7 million, or 2.2%, for year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, insurance and claims increased to 4.9% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 4.4% in 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, insurance and claims increased to 5.3% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 5.0% in 2015. These increases are primarily related to the $3.6 million benefit in the second quarter of 2015 from commutation of our auto liability policy for the period from April 1, 2013, through September 30, 2014. These increases also resulted from increased accident severity, resulting in total insurance cost increasing to 10.3 cents per mile for 2016 from 9.6 cents per mile in 2015. These increases were partially offset by decreased accident rates in 2016, as measured by a 6.8% improvement in DOT reportable accidents per million miles driven at 0.82% - the second lowest in the last ten years.\nOur auto liability (personal injury and property damage), cargo, and general liability insurance programs include significant self-insured retention amounts. The auto liability policy contains a feature whereby we are able to retroactively obtain a partial refund of the premium in exchange for taking on the liability for incidents that occurred during the period and releasing the insurers. This is referred to as \"commuting\" the policy or \"policy commutation.\" In several past periods, including the policy period from April 1, 2013, through September 30, 2014, commuted in 2015, we have commuted the policy, which has lowered our insurance and claims expense. We are also self-insured for physical damage to our equipment. Because of these significant self-insured exposures, insurance and claims expense may fluctuate significantly from period-to-period. Any increase in frequency or severity of claims, or any increases to then-existing reserves, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We have accrued a reserve in connection with a judgment that was rendered against us based on a 2008 cargo claim. We recorded an additional $0.9 million of expense in the first quarter of 2017 in order to accrue additional legal fees and pre-judgment interest since the time of our previous appeal. We are currently pursuing a second appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals related to the District Court's decision on damages. If these further proceedings are resolved favorably to us, any reduction of the accrual could reduce insurance and claims expense in the period in which the claim is resolved. On the other hand, if the proceedings are not resolved favorably, insurance and claims expense may increase as a result of continuing litigation expenses, including pre and post judgment interest. We periodically evaluate strategies to efficiently reduce our insurance and claims expense, which in the past have included the commutation of our auto liability insurance policy. We intend to evaluate our ability to commute the current policy and any such commutation could significantly impact insurance and claims expense.\nCommunications and utilities\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Communications and utilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,938\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,057\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,162\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the periods presented, the changes in communications and utilities were not significant as either a percentage of total revenue or freight revenue.\nGeneral supplies and expenses\nTable 45: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General supplies and expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,783\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,413\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,007\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the periods presented, the changes in communications and utilities were not significant as either a percentage of total revenue or freight revenue.\nDepreciation and amortization\nTable 46: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 76,447\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 72,456\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 61,384\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 11.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDepreciation and amortization consists primarily of depreciation of tractors, trailers and other capital assets offset or increased, as applicable, by gains or losses on dispositions of capital assets.

As a percentage of total revenue, depreciation and amortization remained flat at 10.8% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. As a percentage of freight revenue, depreciation and amortization increased to 12.2% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 11.9% in 2016. Depreciation, consisting primarily of depreciation of revenue equipment and excluding gains and losses, increased $0.8 million in 2017 from 2016, primarily as a result of the full year effect of the decreased salvage values implemented in 2016.

Depreciation, consisting primarily of depreciation of revenue equipment and excluding gains and losses, increased $9.6 million in 2016 from 2015, primarily as a result of more owned equipment and a significant reduction on the value of used tractors resulting in a change to residual values. Losses on the disposal of property and equipment totaled $0.8 million in 2016, as compared to gains of $0.6 million in 2015.\nWe expect depreciation and amortization to stabilize as the impact of the significant 2016 reductions in residual values will flatten on a comparative basis going forward. Additionally, if the used tractor market were to decline further, we could have to adjust residual values again and increase depreciation or experience increased losses on sale.\nInterest expense, net\nTable 47: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,258\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,226\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,445\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the periods presented, the change in interest expense, net was not significant as either a percentage of total revenue or freight revenue.\nThis line item will fluctuate based on our decision with respect to purchasing revenue equipment with balance sheet debt versus operating leases as well as our ability to continue to generate profitable results and reduce our leverage.\nIncome from equity method investment\nTable 48: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from equity method investment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,400\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,570\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have accounted for our investment in TEL using the equity method of accounting and thus our financial results include our proportionate share of TEL's net income.

We expect the impact on our earnings resulting from our investment in TEL to improve year-over-year, particularly if the used equipment market stabilizes or improves.\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\nTable 49: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax (benefit) expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (32,142\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,386\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,822\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (4.6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (5.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome tax (benefit) expense fluctuated approximately $42.5 million, or 409.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 2016. As a percentage of total revenue, income tax (benefit) expense decreased to -4.6% of total revenue for 2017 from 1.5% in 2016. As a percentage of freight revenue, income tax (benefit) expense decreased to -5.1% of freight revenue for 2017 compared to 1.7% in 2016. These decreases were primarily related to the $40.1 million remeasurement of deferred taxes due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Additionally, primarily as a result of tax-planning strategies implemented during the fourth quarter of 2017, we were able to remove valuation allowances on certain state tax net operating losses providing for additional favorable impact of $1.2 million. These decreases were partially offset by the $3.9 million decrease in pre-tax income in 2017 compared to 2016, resulting from the declines in operating income noted above.\nIncome tax expense decreased approximately $11.4 million, or 52.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, income tax expense decreased to 1.5% of total revenue for 2016 from 3.0% in 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, income tax expense decreased to 1.7% of freight revenue for 2016 compared to 3.4% in 2015. These decreases were primarily related to the $36.7 million decrease in pre-tax income in 2016 compared to 2015 resulting from the declines in operating income noted above, the decrease in the contribution from TEL's earnings, and the large non-recurring tax credit in fiscal year 2015.\nThe effective tax rate is different from the expected combined tax rate due primarily to permanent differences related to our per diem pay structure for drivers. Due to the partial nondeductible effect of the per diem payments, our tax rate will fluctuate in future periods as income fluctuates. Our effective tax rate for 2017 was an anomaly due to the nonrecurring remeasurement of deferred taxes noted above related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. We are currently estimating our 2018 effective income tax rate to be in the range of 24.0% to 27.0%.\nRESULTS OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS\nWe have two reportable segments, truckload services, which we refer to as Truckload. In addition, our Managed Freight segment has service offerings ancillary to our Truckload services, including: freight brokerage and logistics service provided both directly and through freight brokerage agents, who are paid a commission for the freight they provide. These operations consist of several operating segments, which are aggregated due to similar margins and customers. Included within Managed Freight is also our accounts receivable factoring business, which does not meet the aggregation criteria but only accounts for $3.1 million of revenue. The operation of each of these businesses is described in our notes to Item 1 of Part 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\"Unallocated Corporate Overhead\" includes costs that are incidental to our activities and are not specifically allocated to one of the segments. The following table summarizes financial and operating data by segment:\nTable 50: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Truckload\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 612,834\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 601,226\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 655,918\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Managed Freight\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 92,173\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 69,425\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 68,322\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 705,007\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 670,651\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 724,240\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Income (loss):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Truckload\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,781\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,031\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 74,107\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Managed Freight\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8,588\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,631\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,768\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated Corporate Overhead\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (19,214\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (12,215\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (12,093\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,155\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,447\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67,782\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2017 to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nOur Truckload revenue increased $11.6 million, as fuel surcharge revenue increased $18.4 million, offset by a decrease in freight revenue of $6.8 million. The decrease in freight revenue relates to a $4.2 million decrease in freight revenue contributed by our temperature-controlled intermodal service offering, a decrease in our average tractor fleet of 1.4% from 2016, partially offset by an increase in average freight revenue per tractor per week of 0.9% compared to 2016. The increase in average freight revenue per tractor per week is the result of a 2.1% increase, or 3.6 cents per mile, in average rate per total mile, partially offset by a 1.4% decrease in average miles per unit when compared to 2016. Team driven units decreased approximately 11.6% to an average of 912 teams in 2017 from 1,032 teams in 2016.\nOur Truckload operating income was $1.7 million higher in 2017 than 2016 primarily as a result of a decrease in operating costs per mile, net of fuel surcharge revenue, due primarily to decreased net fuel expense, partially offset by increased purchased transportation expenses, depreciation and amortization expense, and operations and maintenance expense.\nManaged Freight total revenue increased $22.8 million in 2017 compared to 2016 and Managed Freight operating income increased $1.0 million in 2017 compared to 2016. These improvements are primarily the result of spot market opportunities related to the hurricane-affected regions during 2017 and growth with existing customers compared to 2016.\nUnallocated corporate overhead increased primarily as a result of increased salaries and wages, including workers' compensation expense, compared to the historic lows for workers' compensation in 2016, as well as non-driver headcount increases since 2016 and increased non-driver incentive compensation. Non-driver headcount increased in 2017 due to strategic initiatives in information technology.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2016 to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nOur Truckload revenue decreased $54.7 million, as freight revenue decreased $30.4 million and fuel surcharge revenue decreased $24.3 million. The decrease in freight revenue relates to a decrease in average freight revenue per tractor per week of 2.2% compared to 2015, partially offset by a $1.7 million increase in freight revenue contributed by our temperature-controlled intermodal service offering, as well as a decrease in our average tractor fleet of 3.9% from 2015. The decrease in average freight revenue per tractor per week is the result of a 1.3% decrease, or 2.2 cents per mile, in average rate per total mile and a 0.6% decrease in average miles per unit when compared to 2015. Additionally, team driven units increased approximately 5.3% to an average of approximately 1,000 teams in 2016 compared to approximately 950 in 2015.\nOur Truckload operating income was $37.1 million less in 2016 than 2015 due to the abovementioned decrease in freight revenue. Additionally, operating costs per mile, net of fuel surcharge revenue, increased primarily due to increased salaries, wages, and related expenses (which was primarily due to a higher percentage of our fleet being comprised of team-driven tractors, as well as driver and non-driver employee pay increases since the same 2015 period), increased net fuel expense, and increased capital costs, partially offset by reduced workers' compensation expense and operations and maintenance expense.\nManaged Freight total revenue increased $1.1 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and operating income increased $1.9 million for the same period. These improvements are primarily the result of improved coordination with our Truckload segment, additional business from new customers added during the year, and the full year effect of a large customer added in 2015.\nUnallocated corporate overhead remained relatively flat as a result of a $3.2 million reduction in incentive compensation in 2016, primarily as a result of decreased profitability, partially offset by the 2015 period including the $3.6 million in return of previously expensed insurance premiums for the commutation of our primary auto liability policy for the period of April 1, 2013, through September 30, 2014.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur business requires significant capital investments over the short-term and the long-term. Recently, we have financed our capital requirements with borrowings under our Credit Facility, cash flows from operations, long-term operating leases, capital leases, secured installment notes with finance companies, and proceeds from the sale of our used revenue equipment. Going forward, we expect revenue equipment acquisitions through purchases and capital leases to increase as a percentage of our fleet as we decrease our use of operating leases. We had working capital (total current assets less total current liabilities) of $81.1 million and $47.9 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our working capital on any particular day can vary significantly due to the timing of collections and cash disbursements. Based on our expected financial condition, net capital expenditures, results of operations, related net cash flows, installment notes, and other sources of financing, we believe our working capital and sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our current and projected needs and we do not expect to experience material liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $9.0 million of borrowings outstanding, undrawn letters of credit outstanding of approximately $32.9 million, and available borrowing capacity of $53.1 million under the Credit Facility. Fluctuations in the outstanding balance and related availability under our Credit Facility are driven primarily by cash flows from operations and the timing and nature of property and equipment additions that are not funded through notes payable, as well as the nature and timing of collection of accounts receivable, payments of accrued expenses, and receipt of proceeds from disposals of property and equipment. Unless we decide to make any strategic investments during the year, we anticipate paying off an aggregate of approximately $40.0 to $60.0 million of financing and lease liabilities, comprised of both on and off balance sheet obligations, during 2018.\nWith an average tractor fleet age of 2.1 years, we believe we have flexibility to manage our fleet and we plan to regularly evaluate our tractor replacement cycle, new tractor purchase requirements, and financing options.\nCash Flows\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities were $82.9 million in 2017 compared with $102.4 million in 2016 primarily due to the change in receivables and advances related to the timing of revenue and the related collections at the beginning of each period and the timing of cash collections on our other receivables in 2017 compared to 2016. These declines are partially offset by net income of $55.4 million in 2017 compared to net income of $16.8 million in 2016, of which approximately $40.1 million relates to the one-time remeasurement of deferred taxes due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The fluctuations in cash flows from accounts payable and accrued expenses primarily related to the timing of payments on our accrued expenses and trade accounts in the 2017 period compared to the 2016 period.\nNet cash flows used by investing activities were $62.1 million in 2017 compared with $47.3 million in 2016. The $14.8 million increase in net investing activities was attributable primarily to a $16.8 million decrease in proceeds from dispositions of used revenue equipment which primarily resulted from the timing and dispositions of assets held for sale as well as our decision to extend the trade cycle of our current equipment. During 2018 we plan to take delivery of approximately 510 new company tractors and dispose of approximately 500 used tractors. This compares to the approximately 635 new company tractors we took delivery of and the approximately 615 used tractors we disposed of during 2017. Going forward, cash flows from disposals of equipment could be more volatile given the weakness in the used tractor market.\nNet cash flows used in financing activities were $13.2 million in 2017 compared to $51.9 million in 2016, primarily as a function of net repayments, in 2016, of notes payable facilitated by cash flows primarily related to the trade cycle of our revenue equipment. In particular, this decrease reflects the sale of the previously noted 615 tractors in the 2017 compared to 1,074 tractors in 2016.\nGoing forward, our cash flows may fluctuate depending on capital expenditures, the resolution of the 2008 cargo claim, future stock repurchases, strategic investments or divestitures, and the extent of future income tax obligations and refunds.\nMaterial Debt Agreements\nWe and substantially all of our subsidiaries (collectively, the \"Borrowers\") are parties to a Third Amended and Restated Credit Facility (the \"Credit Facility\") with Bank of America, N.A., as agent (the \"Agent\") and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\"JPM,\" and together with the Agent, the \"Lenders\").\nThe Credit Facility is a $95.0 million revolving credit facility, with an uncommitted accordion feature that, so long as no event of default exists, allows us to request an increase in the revolving credit facility of up to $50.0 million, subject to Lender acceptance of the additional funding commitment. The Credit Facility includes, within our $95.0 million revolving credit facility, a letter of credit sub facility in an aggregate amount of $95.0 million and a swing line sub facility in an aggregate amount equal to the greater of $10.0 million or 10% of the Lenders' aggregate commitments under the Credit Facility from time-to-time.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility are classified as either \"base rate loans\" or \"LIBOR loans.\" Base rate loans accrue interest at a base rate equal to the greater of the Agent's prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, or LIBOR plus 1.0%, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.5% to 1.0%; while LIBOR loans accrue interest at LIBOR, plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.5% to 2.0%. The applicable rates are adjusted quarterly based on average pricing availability. The unused line fee is the product of 0.25% times the average daily amount by which the Lenders' aggregate revolving commitments under the Credit Facility exceed the outstanding principal amount of revolver loans and the aggregate undrawn amount of all outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility. The obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by us and secured by a pledge of substantially all of our assets, with the notable exclusion of any real estate or revenue equipment pledged under other financing agreements, including revenue equipment installment notes and capital leases.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility are subject to a borrowing base limited to the lesser of (A) $95.0 million, minus the sum of the stated amount of all outstanding letters of credit; or (B) the sum of (i) 85% of eligible accounts receivable, plus (ii) the lesser of (a) 85% of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible revenue equipment, (b) 95% of the net book value of eligible revenue equipment, or (c) 35% of the Lenders' aggregate revolving commitments under the Credit Facility, plus (iii) the lesser of (a) $25.0 million or (b) 65% of the appraised fair market value of eligible real estate, as reduced by a periodic amortization amount. We had $9.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2017, undrawn letters of credit outstanding of approximately $32.9 million, and available borrowing capacity of $53.1 million. The interest rate on outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2017, was 5.0% on less than $0.1 million of base rate loans and 3.1% on $9.0 million of LIBOR loans. Based on availability as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, there was no fixed charge coverage requirement.\nThe Credit Facility includes usual and customary events of default for a facility of this nature and provides that, upon the occurrence and continuation of an event of default, payment of all amounts payable under the Credit Facility may be accelerated, and the Lenders' commitments may be terminated. If an event of default occurs under the Credit Facility and the Lenders cause all of the outstanding debt obligations under the Credit Facility to become due and payable, this could result in a default under other debt instruments that contain acceleration or cross-default provisions. The Credit Facility contains certain restrictions and covenants relating to, among other things, debt, dividends, liens, acquisitions and dispositions outside of the ordinary course of business, and affiliate transactions. Failure to comply with the covenants and restrictions set forth in the Credit Facility could result in an event of default.\nCapital lease obligations are utilized to finance a portion of our revenue equipment and are entered into with certain finance companies who are not parties to our Credit Facility. The leases in effect at December 31, 2017 terminate in January 2018 through September 2023 and contain guarantees of the residual value of the related equipment by us. As such, the residual guarantees are included in the related debt balance as a balloon payment at the end of the related term as well as included in the future minimum capital lease payments. These lease agreements require us to pay personal property taxes, maintenance, and operating expenses.\nPricing for the revenue equipment installment notes is quoted by the respective financial affiliates of our primary revenue equipment suppliers and other lenders at the funding of each group of equipment acquired and include fixed annual rates for new equipment under retail installment contracts. The notes included in the funding are due in monthly installments with final maturities at various dates ranging from January 2018 to July 2023. The notes contain certain requirements regarding payment, insuring of collateral, and other matters, but do not have any financial or other material covenants or events of default except certain notes totaling $120.8 million are cross-defaulted with the Credit Facility. Additionally, our fuel hedge contracts totaling $0.8 million at December 31, 2017, are cross-defaulted with the Credit Facility. Additional borrowings from the financial affiliates of our primary revenue equipment suppliers and other lenders are expected to be available to fund new tractors expected to be delivered in 2018, while any other property and equipment purchases, including trailers, are expected to be funded with a combination of available cash, notes, operating leases, capital leases, and/or from the Credit Facility.\nIn August 2015, we financed a portion of the purchase of our corporate headquarters, a maintenance facility, and certain surrounding property in Chattanooga, Tennessee by entering into a $28.0 million variable rate note with a third party lender. Concurrently with entering into the note, we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively fix the related interest rate to 4.2%. See Note 13 for further information about the interest rate swap.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table sets forth our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td> Payments due by period:\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(less than\n1 year)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(1-3 years)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(1-3 years)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(3-5 years)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(3-5 years)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nMore than\n5 years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit Facility (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,187\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,187\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue equipment and property installment notes, including interest (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 204,414\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 30,503\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 30,505\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 51,731\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 39,558\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,311\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,806\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital leases (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 26,951\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,606\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,606\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,813\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,368\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,175\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,383\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lease residual value guarantees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,968\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,961\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,007\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations (5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 51,660\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 51,660\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual cash obligations (6)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 297,399\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 88,803\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 35,191\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 57,617\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55,113\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,486\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,189\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 52: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Represents principal owed at December 31, 2017 and interest on such principal amount through maturity.

At December 31, 2017, we had financed 234 tractors and 967 trailers under operating leases. Vehicles held under operating leases are not carried on our consolidated balance sheets, and lease payments, in respect of such vehicles, are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations in the line item \"Revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation.\" Our revenue equipment rental expense was $12.1 million in 2017, compared with $10.6 million in 2016. The total value of remaining payments under operating leases as of December 31, 2017, was approximately $18.6 million. In connection with various operating leases, we issued residual value guarantees, which provide that if we do not purchase the leased equipment from the lessor at the end of the lease term, we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the equipment and an agreed value. The residual guarantees expire between August 2018 and February 2019 and had an undiscounted value of approximately $4.0 million at December 31, 2017. The discounted present value of the total remaining lease payments and residual value guarantees were approximately $21.7 million at December 31, 2017. We expect our residual guarantees to approximate the market value at the end of the lease term. We believe that proceeds from the sale of equipment under operating leases would equal or exceed the payment obligation on substantially all operating leases.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make decisions based upon estimates, assumptions, and factors we consider as relevant to the circumstances. Such decisions include the selection of applicable accounting principles and the use of judgment in their application, the results of which impact reported amounts and disclosures. Changes in future economic conditions or other business circumstances may affect the outcomes of our estimates and assumptions. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those anticipated. A summary of the significant accounting policies followed in preparation of the financial statements is contained in Note 1, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" of the consolidated financial statements attached hereto. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue, drivers' wages, and other direct operating expenses generated by our Truckload reportable segment are recognized on the date shipments are delivered to the customer. Revenue includes transportation revenue, fuel surcharges, loading and unloading activities, equipment detention, and other accessorial services.\nRevenue generated by our Managed Freight segment is recognized upon completion of the services provided. Revenue is recorded on a gross basis, without deducting third party purchased transportation costs, as we act as a principal with substantial risks as primary obligor, except for transactions whereby equipment from our Truckload segment perform the related services, which we record on a net basis in accordance with the related authoritative guidance. Managed Freight revenue includes $3.1 million, $2.6 million, and $2.4 million of revenue in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, related to an accounts receivable factoring business. Revenue for this business is recognized on a net basis, given we are acting as an agent and are not the primary obligor in these transactions.\nDepreciation of Revenue Equipment\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation for book purposes is determined using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, while depreciation for tax purposes is generally recorded using an accelerated method. Depreciation of revenue equipment is our largest item of depreciation. We generally depreciate new tractors (excluding day cabs) over five years to salvage values of approximately 15% of their cost and new trailers over seven years for refrigerated trailers and ten years for dry van trailers to salvage values of approximately 25% of their cost. We annually review the reasonableness of our estimates regarding useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and other long-lived assets based upon, among other things, our experience with similar assets, conditions in the used revenue equipment market, and prevailing industry practice. Over the past several years, the price of new tractors has risen dramatically and there has been significant volatility in the used equipment market. As a result of the progressive decline in the market value of used tractors and our expectations that used tractor prices will not rebound in the near term, effective July 1, 2016 we reduced the salvage values on our tractors and, thus, prospectively increased depreciation expense. Estimates around the salvage values and useful lives for trailers remain unchanged. The impact from the third quarter of 2016 through 2017 was approximately $2.0 million per quarter of additional depreciation expense in subsequent quarters, or approximately $1.2 million per quarter net of tax, which represents approximately $0.06 per common or diluted share. We expect depreciation levels in 2018 to approximate those of 2017. Changes in the useful life or salvage value estimates, or fluctuations in market values that are not reflected in our estimates, could have a material effect on our results of operations. Gains and losses on the disposal of revenue equipment are included in depreciation expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nIn 2017 and 2016 we had net losses on revenue equipment of $4.0 million and $0.8 million, respectively, and in 2015 we generated net gains on revenue equipment, including assets held for sale, of $0.6 million. We review salvage values of our revenue equipment annually and make adjustments periodically, based on trends in the used equipment market, to reflect updated estimates of fair value at disposal.\nWe lease certain revenue equipment under capital leases with terms of approximately 60 to 84 months. Amortization of leased assets is included in depreciation and amortization expense.\nPursuant to applicable accounting standards, revenue equipment and other long-lived assets are tested for impairment whenever an event occurs that indicates impairment may exist. Expected future cash flows are used to analyze whether an impairment has occurred. If the sum of expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the long-lived asset, then an impairment loss is recognized. We measure the impairment loss by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. Fair value is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis or the appraised value of the assets, as appropriate.\nAlthough a portion of our tractors are protected by non-binding indicative trade-in values or binding trade-back agreements with the manufacturers, some tractors and substantially all of our owned trailers continue to be subject to fluctuations in market prices for used revenue equipment. Moreover, our trade-back agreements are contingent upon reaching acceptable terms for the purchase of new equipment. Further declines in the price of used revenue equipment or failure to reach agreement for the purchase of new tractors with the manufacturers issuing trade-back agreements could result in impairment of, or losses on the sale of, revenue equipment. Historically, only a de minimis percentage of our equipment has been sold back to the dealers pursuant to the trade back agreements as we have generally found that market prices exceeded the trade back allowances, although in recent years, trade back allowances have increased as a result of the increasing cost of the underlying equipment.\nAssets Held For Sale\nAssets held for sale include property and revenue equipment no longer utilized in continuing operations which are available and held for sale. Assets held for sale are no longer subject to depreciation, and are recorded at the lower of depreciated book value or fair market value less selling costs. We periodically review the carrying value of these assets for possible impairment. We expect to sell these assets within twelve months.\nInsurance and Other Claims\nThe primary claims arising against us consist of auto liability (personal injury and property damage), workers' compensation, cargo, commercial liability, and employee medical expenses. Our insurance program involves self-insurance with the following risk retention levels (before giving effect to any commutation of an auto liability policy):\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> auto liability - $1.0 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> workers' compensation - $1.3 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> cargo - $0.3 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> employee medical - $0.4 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> physical damage - 100%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDue to our significant self-insured retention amounts, we have exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims and to variations between our estimated and actual ultimate payouts. We accrue the estimated cost of the uninsured portion of pending claims and an estimate for allocated loss adjustment expenses including legal and other direct costs associated with a claim. Estimates require judgments concerning the nature and severity of the claim, historical trends, advice from third-party administrators and insurers, the size of any potential damage award based on factors such as the specific facts of individual cases, the jurisdictions involved, the prospect of punitive damages, future medical costs, and inflation estimates of future claims development, and the legal and other costs to settle or defend the claims. We have significant exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims. If there is an increase in the frequency and severity of claims, or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts if the claims prove to be more severe than originally assessed, or any of the claims would exceed the limits of our insurance coverage, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to estimates within our self-insured retention layers, we also must make judgments concerning claims where we have third party insurance and for claims outside our coverage limits. Upon settling claims and expenses associated with claims where we have third party coverage, we are generally required to initially fund payment to the claimant and seek reimbursement from the insurer. Receivables from insurers for claims and expenses we have paid on behalf of insurers were $1.1 million and $0.7 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and are included in drivers' advances and other receivables on our consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, we accrue claims above our self-insured retention and record a corresponding receivable for amounts we expect to collect from insurers upon settlement of such claims. We have $2.1 million and less than $0.1 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as a receivable in other assets and as a corresponding accrual in the long-term portion of insurance and claims accruals on our consolidated balance sheet for claims above our self-insured retention for which we believe it is reasonably assured that the insurers will provide their portion of such claims. We evaluate collectability of the receivables based on the credit worthiness and surplus of the insurers, along with our prior experience and contractual terms with each. If any claim occurrence were to exceed our aggregate coverage limits, we would have to accrue for the excess amount. Our critical estimates include evaluating whether a claim may exceed such limits and, if so, by how much. If one or more claims were to exceed our then effective coverage limits, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe also make judgments regarding the ultimate benefit versus risk of commuting certain periods within our auto liability policy. If we commute a policy, we assume 100% risk for covered claims in exchange for a policy refund. In April 2015, we commuted two liability policies for the period from April 1, 2013 through September 30, 2014, such that we are now responsible for any claim that occurred during that period up to $20.0 million, should such a claim develop. We recorded a $3.6 million reduction in insurance and claims expense in the second quarter of 2015 related to the commutation. The insurer did not remit the premium refund directly to the Company, but rather applied a credit to the current auto liability insurance policy, such that we recorded the policy release premium refund as a prepaid asset at June 30, 2015.\nEffective April 2015, we entered into new auto liability policies with a three-year term. The policy includes a limit for a single loss of $9.0 million, an aggregate of $18.0 million for each policy year, and a $30.0 million aggregate for the 42 month term ended March 31, 2018. The policy includes a policy release premium refund of up to $14.6 million, less any future amounts paid on claims by the insurer, from October 1, 2014 through March 31, 2018, if we were to commute the policy for the entire 42 months. A decision with respect to commutation of the policy cannot be made before April 1, 2018, unless both we and the insurance carrier agree to a commutation prior to the end of the policy term. Management cannot predict whether or not future claims or the development of existing claims will justify a commutation, and accordingly, no related amounts were recorded at December 31, 2017.\nIf claims development factors that are based upon historical experience change by 10%, our claims accrual as of December 31, 2017, would change by approximately $0.8 million.\nLease Accounting and Off-Balance Sheet Transactions\nWe issue residual value guarantees in connection with the operating leases we enter into for certain of our revenue equipment. These leases provide that if we do not purchase the leased equipment from the lessor at the end of the lease term, then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the equipment and an agreed value. To the extent the expected value at the lease termination date is lower than the residual value guarantee, we would accrue for the difference over the remaining lease term. We believe that proceeds from the sale of equipment under operating leases would equal or exceed the payment obligation on substantially all operating leases. The estimated values at lease termination involve management judgments. As leases are entered into, determination as to the classification as an operating or capital lease involves management judgments on residual values and useful lives.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We believe the future tax deductions will be realized principally through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income, except for when a valuation allowance has been provided.\nIn the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions. We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management's evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense.\nStock-Based Employee Compensation\nWe issue several types of stock-based compensation, including awards that vest based on service and performance conditions or a combination of the conditions. Performance-based awards vest contingent upon meeting certain performance criteria established by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. For performance-based awards, determining the appropriate amount to expense in each period is based on likelihood and timing of achieving the stated targets and requires judgment, including forecasting future financial results. The estimates are revised periodically based on the probability and timing of achieving the required performance targets and adjustments are made as appropriate. Awards that are only subject to time vesting provisions are amortized using the straight-line method.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nOur financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, commodity contracts, accounts payable, debt, and interest rate swaps. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and current debt approximates their fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of the factored receivables approximates the fair value, as the receivables are generally repaid directly to us by the client's customer within 30-40 days due to the combination of the short-term nature of the financing transaction and the underlying quality of the receivables. Interest rates that are currently available to us for issuance of long-term debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate the fair value of our long-term debt, which primarily consists of revenue equipment installment notes. The fair value of our revenue equipment installment notes approximated the carrying value at December 31, 2017, as the weighted average interest rate on these notes approximates the market rate for similar debt. Borrowings under our revolving Credit Facility approximate fair value due to the variable interest rate on the facility. Additionally, commodity contracts, which are accounted for as hedge derivatives, as discussed in Note 13, are valued based on the forward rate of the specific indices upon which the contract is being settled and adjusted for counterparty credit risk using available market information and valuation methodologies. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements is determined using the market-standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed-cash payments and the discounted expected variable-cash receipts. The variable-cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. These analyses reflect the contractual terms of the swap, including the period to maturity, and use observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities. The fair value calculation also includes an amount for risk of non-performance of our counterparties using \"significant unobservable inputs\" such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default, which we have determined to be insignificant to the overall fair value of our interest rate swap agreements.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nWe periodically utilize derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in fuel prices and interest rates. At inception of a derivative contract, we document relationships between derivative instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various derivative transactions, and assess hedge effectiveness. We record derivative financial instruments in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability at fair value. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. The changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAccounting Standards adopted\nIn August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued ASU 2017-12, which among other things, eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and requires all items that affect earnings to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. The ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. We have adopted the standard for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. Entities adopting the ASU must apply a cumulative-effect adjustment related to the elimination of the separate hedge ineffectiveness measurement. No adjustment was required, however, since no hedge ineffectiveness has been recorded. We have adopted the amended presentation and disclosure guidance, which is required only prospectively.\nAccounting Standards not yet adopted\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09. The new standard introduces a five-step model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The premise of the new model is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard will be effective for us for our annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Entities are allowed to transition to the new standard by either recasting prior periods or recognizing the cumulative effect.\nThe new standard will require us to recognize revenue from loads proportionally as the transportation service is performed as opposed to recognizing revenue upon the completion of the load, which is our current practice. Our recognition of revenue under the new standard will approximate our recognition of revenue under the current standards, as there will generally be a consistent amount of freight in process at the beginning and end of the period; however, seasonality and the day on which the period ends may cause minor differences. We plan to transition to the new standard by recognizing the cumulative effect of adoption as an adjustment in the first quarter of 2018. We believe the cumulative effect of the adoption will result in a positive adjustment to retained earnings of approximately $0.6 million, net of tax, from initially recording in process revenue and associated direct expenses. We plan to finalize our evaluation during the first quarter of 2018, including an assessment of the new expanded disclosure requirements and a final determination of the impact to adoption and related changes required to internal controls.\nIn February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which requires lessees to recognize a right-to-use asset and a lease obligation for all leases. Lessees are permitted to make an accounting policy election to not recognize an asset and liability for leases with a term of twelve months or less. Lessor accounting under the new standard is substantially unchanged. Additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures, including significant judgments made by management, will be required. This new standard will become effective for us in our annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period and requires a modified retrospective transition approach. We are currently evaluating the impacts the adoption of this standard will have on the consolidated financial statements.\nINFLATION, NEW EMISSIONS CONTROL REGULATIONS, AND FUEL COSTS\nMost of our operating expenses are inflation-sensitive, with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations. In recent years, the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices and the related depreciation, health care, and driver and non-driver wages. New emissions control regulations and increases in wages of manufacturing workers and other items have resulted in higher tractor prices, while the decline in the market value of used equipment significantly reduced the residual values of units in fiscal 2015 through 2017. The cost of fuel has been extremely volatile over the last several years, with costs increasing slightly in 2017 after significant decreases in both 2016 and 2015. We believe at least some of this volatility reflects the fluctuations in the U.S. dollar and global demand for petroleum products, unrest in certain oil-producing countries, improved fuel efficiency due to technological advancements, and an increase in domestic supply. Health care prices have increased faster than general inflation, primarily due to the rapid increase in prescription drug costs and more people on our health plan in order to comply with the individual healthcare mandate. The nationwide shortage of qualified drivers has caused us to raise driver wages per mile at a rate faster than general inflation for the past four years, and this trend may continue as additional government regulations constrain industry capacity. Additionally, competition and the related cost to employ non-drivers have increased, especially for the more skilled or technical positions, including mechanics, those with information technology related skills, and degreed professionals.\nSEASONALITY\nIn 2015 and 2016, we experienced marked surges in business and profitability during the fourth quarter holiday season, due to our team drivers and customer base. This occurred again in 2017, though not to the same extent as in the previous two years. After this surge, revenue generally decreases as customers reduce shipments following the holiday season and as inclement weather impedes operations. At the same time, operating expenses generally increase, with fuel efficiency declining because of engine idling and weather, creating more physical damage equipment repairs. For the reasons stated, first quarter results historically have been lower than results in each of the other three quarters of the year, excluding charges. The duration of what is considered peak season has shortened over the last few years and now is approximately a five-week period beginning the week of Thanksgiving and ending on Christmas Eve, and we have seen our customers' networks adjust accordingly. If this trend continues, our ability to take advantage of this surge in business and our fourth quarter profitability could be negatively affected.", "item_7_truncated": "Managed Freight total revenue increased $22.8 million in 2017 compared to 2016 and Managed Freight operating income increased $1.0 million in 2017 compared to 2016. These improvements are primarily the result of spot market opportunities related to the hurricane-affected regions during 2017 and growth with existing customers compared to 2016.\nFor the periods presented, the changes in communications and utilities were not significant as either a percentage of total revenue or freight revenue.\nTable 40: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operations and maintenance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48,774\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,864\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 46,458\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nTable 48: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from equity method investment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,400\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,570\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhile we have generally been pleased with recent profitability levels and operational improvements, particularly at SRT, we still have work ahead as operating results were behind those of 2016. Additionally, we were disappointed with our fourth quarter peak season for the second consecutive year. In addition to managing our operating costs, we continue to evaluate the most effective level of participation in the peak season and the manner of allocating our assets and coordinating third party capacity. We remain committed to providing peak capacity for our customers; however, we will need to challenge our pricing models to ensure we are appropriately rewarded for our efforts related to this valuable annual shipping period.\nThe effective tax rate is different from the expected combined tax rate due primarily to permanent differences related to our per diem pay structure for drivers. Due to the partial nondeductible effect of the per diem payments, our tax rate will fluctuate in future periods as income fluctuates. Our effective tax rate for 2017 was an anomaly due to the nonrecurring remeasurement of deferred taxes noted above related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. We are currently estimating our 2018 effective income tax rate to be in the range of 24.0% to 27.0%.\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> auto liability - $1.0 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> workers' compensation - $1.3 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> cargo - $0.3 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> employee medical - $0.4 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> physical damage - 100%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSalaries, wages, and related expenses\nDepreciation and amortization\n (1) Represents principal owed at December 31, 2017 and interest on such principal amount through maturity. The borrowings consist of draws under our Credit Facility, with fluctuating borrowing amounts and variable interest rates. In determining future contractual interest and principal obligations, for variable interest rate debt, the interest rate and principal amount in place at December 31, 2017, was utilized. The table assumes long-term debt is held to maturity. Refer to Note 7, \"Debt\" of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. (2) Represents principal and interest payments owed at December 31, 2017. The borrowings consist of installment notes with finance companies, with fixed borrowing amounts and fixed interest rates, except for a variable rate real estate note, for which the interest rate is effectively fixed through an interest rate swap. The table assumes these installment notes are held to maturity. Refer to Note 7, \"Debt\" of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. (3) Represents future monthly rental payment obligations under operating leases for tractors, trailers, and terminal properties, and computer and office equipment. Substantially all lease agreements for revenue equipment have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. The tractor lease agreements generally stipulate maximum miles and provide for mileage penalties for excess miles. These leases generally run for a period of three to five years for tractors and five to seven years for trailers. Refer to Note 8, \"Leases\" of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. (4) Represents principal and interest payments owed at December 31, 2017. The borrowings consist of capital leases with one finance company, with fixed borrowing amounts and fixed interest rates or rates that are floating but effectively fixed through related interest rate swaps. Borrowings in 2018 and thereafter include the residual value guarantees on the related equipment as balloon payments. Refer to Note 7, \"Debt\" of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. (5) Represents purchase obligations for revenue equipment totaling approximately $51.7 million in 2017. These commitments are cancelable, subject to certain adjustments in the underlying obligations and benefits.

If an event of default occurs under the Credit Facility and the Lenders cause all of the outstanding debt obligations under the Credit Facility to become due and payable, this could result in a default under other debt instruments that contain acceleration or cross-default provisions. The Credit Facility contains certain restrictions and covenants relating to, among other things, debt, dividends, liens, acquisitions and dispositions outside of the ordinary course of business, and affiliate transactions. Failure to comply with the covenants and restrictions set forth in the Credit Facility could result in an event of default.\nTable 47: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,258\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,226\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,445\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued ASU 2017-12, which among other things, eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and requires all items that affect earnings to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item.

In recent years, the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices and the related depreciation, health care, and driver and non-driver wages. New emissions control regulations and increases in wages of manufacturing workers and other items have resulted in higher tractor prices, while the decline in the market value of used equipment significantly reduced the residual values of units in fiscal 2015 through 2017. The cost of fuel has been extremely volatile over the last several years, with costs increasing slightly in 2017 after significant decreases in both 2016 and 2015. We believe at least some of this volatility reflects the fluctuations in the U.S. dollar and global demand for petroleum products, unrest in certain oil-producing countries, improved fuel efficiency due to technological advancements, and an increase in domestic supply. Health care prices have increased faster than general inflation, primarily due to the rapid increase in prescription drug costs and more people on our health plan in order to comply with the individual healthcare mandate. The nationwide shortage of qualified drivers has caused us to raise driver wages per mile at a rate faster than general inflation for the past four years, and this trend may continue as additional government regulations constrain industry capacity. Additionally, competition and the related cost to employ non-drivers have increased, especially for the more skilled or technical positions, including mechanics, those with information technology related skills, and degreed professionals.\nTable 45: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General supplies and expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,783\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,413\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,007\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nTable 49: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax (benefit) expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (32,142\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,386\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,822\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (4.6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (5.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nTable 39: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total fuel surcharge\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 78,198\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 59,806\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 84,120\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Fuel surcharge revenue reimbursed to owner operators and other third parties\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,997\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,250\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,790\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Company fuel surcharge revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 70,201\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 53,556\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 76,330\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total fuel expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 103,139\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 103,108\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 122,160\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Company fuel surcharge revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 70,201\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 53,556\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 76,330\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net fuel expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,938\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 49,552\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,830\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nTo measure the effectiveness of our fuel surcharge program, we subtract fuel surcharge revenue (other than the fuel surcharge revenue we reimburse to owner operators and other third parties, which is included in purchased transportation) from our fuel expense.

Fluctuations in the outstanding balance and related availability under our Credit Facility are driven primarily by cash flows from operations and the timing and nature of property and equipment additions that are not funded through notes payable, as well as the nature and timing of collection of accounts receivable, payments of accrued expenses, and receipt of proceeds from disposals of property and equipment. Unless we decide to make any strategic investments during the year, we anticipate paying off an aggregate of approximately $40.0 to $60.0 million of financing and lease liabilities, comprised of both on and off balance sheet obligations, during 2018.\nOur annual operating ratio deteriorated 80 basis points to 96.0%. Our adjusted operating ratio (as defined below), a key measure of profitability in our industry, also deteriorated 80 basis points to a 95.5%. These unfavorable changes were primarily the result of the significantly more expensive third-party capacity during the latter portion of the year, affecting our Managed Freight and Truckload segments, as well as increased employee wages and increased capital costs compared to 2016. Our consolidated financial results are summarized as follows:\nThe decrease in 2017 Truckload revenue relates to a $4.2 million decrease in freight revenue contributed by our temperature-controlled intermodal service offering, a decrease in our average tractor fleet of 1.4% from 2016, partially offset by an increase in average freight revenue per tractor per week of 0.9% compared to 2016. The increase in average freight revenue per tractor per week is the result of a 2.1% increase, or 3.6 cents per mile, in average rate per total mile, partially offset by a 1.4% decrease in average miles per unit when compared to 2016. Team driven units decreased approximately 11.6% to an average of 912 teams in 2017 from 1,032 teams in 2016.\nTable 42: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating taxes and licenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,878\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,712\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,016\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInsurance and claims\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Communications and utilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,938\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,057\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,162\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGiven recent historical lows, we would expect diesel fuel prices to increase over the next few years. We are continuing our efforts to increase our ability to recover fuel surcharges under our customer contracts for fuel used in refrigeration units. If these efforts are successful, it could give rise to an increase in fuel surcharges recovered and a corresponding decrease in net fuel expense. Also, due to hedging contracts being locked in at a fixed rate on a portion of the fuel gallons we expect to use in 2018, we expect net fuel expense to decline in 2018 if fuel prices remain flat or increase. We do not currently have fuel hedging contracts for periods beyond 2018.\nAdditionally, $4.1 million, $16.7 million, and $15.3 million were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to our results from operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, as additional fuel expense for 2017, 2016 and 2015, related to losses on fuel hedge contracts that expired. We previously evaluated these contracts for \"hedge effectiveness,\" which is the extent to which the hedge contract effectively offsets changes in cash flows that the contract was intended to offset. At December 31, 2017, all fuel hedge contracts were deemed to be effective and thus continue to qualify as cash flow hedges. As a result of our early adoption of ASU 2017-12, we are no longer required to measure or record hedge ineffectiveness.\n\n\nTable 35: <table> <tr> <td> Operating Ratio ( OR\u201d) From 2015 to 2017\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GAAP Operating Ratio:\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> OR %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> OR %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> OR %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 705,007\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 670,651\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 724,240\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 676,852\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 96.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 638,204\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 95.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 656,458\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 90.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,155\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,447\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67,782\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted Operating Ratio:\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Adj.

The applicable rates are adjusted quarterly based on average pricing availability. The unused line fee is the product of 0.25% times the average daily amount by which the Lenders' aggregate revolving commitments under the Credit Facility exceed the outstanding principal amount of revolver loans and the aggregate undrawn amount of all outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility. The obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by us and secured by a pledge of substantially all of our assets, with the notable exclusion of any real estate or revenue equipment pledged under other financing agreements, including revenue equipment installment notes and capital leases.\nOur Truckload operating income was $1.7 million higher in 2017 than 2016 primarily as a result of a decrease in operating costs per mile, net of fuel surcharge revenue, due primarily to decreased net fuel expense, partially offset by increased purchased transportation expenses, depreciation and amortization expense, and operations and maintenance expense.\nWe have accounted for our investment in TEL using the equity method of accounting and thus our financial results include our proportionate share of TEL's net income. Given TEL's growth during the three years preceding 2015 and volatility in the used and leased equipment markets in which TEL operates, including the recent softening of the used tractor market, the impact on our earnings resulting from our investment and TEL's profitability was more moderate in 2017 and 2016 when compared to 2015, For the year ended December 31, 2017, our earnings resulting from our investment in TEL increased $0.4 million, primarily as a result of growth in TEL's lease offerings. We expect the impact on our earnings resulting from our investment in TEL to improve year-over-year, particularly if the used equipment market stabilizes or improves.\nOur financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, commodity contracts, accounts payable, debt, and interest rate swaps. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and current debt approximates their fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of the factored receivables approximates the fair value, as the receivables are generally repaid directly to us by the client's customer within 30-40 days due to the combination of the short-term nature of the financing transaction and the underlying quality of the receivables. Interest rates that are currently available to us for issuance of long-term debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate the fair value of our long-term debt, which primarily consists of revenue equipment installment notes. The fair value of our revenue equipment installment notes approximated the carrying value at December 31, 2017, as the weighted average interest rate on these notes approximates the market rate for similar debt. Borrowings under our revolving Credit Facility approximate fair value due to the variable interest rate on the facility. Additionally, commodity contracts, which are accounted for as hedge derivatives, as discussed in Note 13, are valued based on the forward rate of the specific indices upon which the contract is being settled and adjusted for counterparty credit risk using available market information and valuation methodologies. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements is determined using the market-standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed-cash payments and the discounted expected variable-cash receipts. The variable-cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. These analyses reflect the contractual terms of the swap, including the period to maturity, and use observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities. The fair value calculation also includes an amount for risk of non-performance of our counterparties using \"significant unobservable inputs\" such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default, which we have determined to be insignificant to the overall fair value of our interest rate swap agreements.\nOperating Ratio\nThe increase in Managed Freight revenue is primarily as a result of spot market opportunities related to the hurricane-affected regions during 2017 and growth with existing customers compared with the same 2016 periods.\nRESULTS OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS\nThe Credit Facility is a $95.0 million revolving credit facility, with an uncommitted accordion feature that, so long as no event of default exists, allows us to request an increase in the revolving credit facility of up to $50.0 million, subject to Lender acceptance of the additional funding commitment. The Credit Facility includes, within our $95.0 million revolving credit facility, a letter of credit sub facility in an aggregate amount of $95.0 million and a swing line sub facility in an aggregate amount equal to the greater of $10.0 million or 10% of the Lenders' aggregate commitments under the Credit Facility from time-to-time.\nSalaries, wages, and related expenses increased approximately $7.3 million, or 3.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 2016. As a percentage of total revenue, salaries, wages, and related expenses decreased to 34.3% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 35.0% in 2016. As a percentage of freight revenue, salaries, wages, and related expenses increased slightly to 38.6% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 38.4% in 2016. The change in salaries, wages, and related expenses is primarily due to pay adjustments for both driver and non-drivers since 2016 and an increase in non-driver incentive compensation. Additionally, fees paid to third party agents increased $1.1 million as a result of improved Managed Freight revenue and workers' compensation costs increased approximately 0.4 cents per mile as compared to the historic lows of 2016.\nAssets Held For Sale\nIn 2015 and 2016, we experienced marked surges in business and profitability during the fourth quarter holiday season, due to our team drivers and customer base. This occurred again in 2017, though not to the same extent as in the previous two years. After this surge, revenue generally decreases as customers reduce shipments following the holiday season and as inclement weather impedes operations. At the same time, operating expenses generally increase, with fuel efficiency declining because of engine idling and weather, creating more physical damage equipment repairs. For the reasons stated, first quarter results historically have been lower than results in each of the other three quarters of the year, excluding charges. The duration of what is considered peak season has shortened over the last few years and now is approximately a five-week period beginning the week of Thanksgiving and ending on Christmas Eve, and we have seen our customers' networks adjust accordingly. If this trend continues, our ability to take advantage of this surge in business and our fourth quarter profitability could be negatively affected.\nManaged Freight total revenue increased $1.1 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and operating income increased $1.9 million for the same period. These improvements are primarily the result of improved coordination with our Truckload segment, additional business from new customers added during the year, and the full year effect of a large customer added in 2015.\n\nINFLATION, NEW EMISSIONS CONTROL REGULATIONS, AND FUEL COSTS\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nIncome tax (benefit) expense fluctuated approximately $42.5 million, or 409.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 2016. As a percentage of total revenue, income tax (benefit) expense decreased to -4.6% of total revenue for 2017 from 1.5% in 2016. As a percentage of freight revenue, income tax (benefit) expense decreased to -5.1% of freight revenue for 2017 compared to 1.7% in 2016. These decreases were primarily related to the $40.1 million remeasurement of deferred taxes due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Additionally, primarily as a result of tax-planning strategies implemented during the fourth quarter of 2017, we were able to remove valuation allowances on certain state tax net operating losses providing for additional favorable impact of $1.2 million. These decreases were partially offset by the $3.9 million decrease in pre-tax income in 2017 compared to 2016, resulting from the declines in operating income noted above.\nDue to our significant self-insured retention amounts, we have exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims and to variations between our estimated and actual ultimate payouts. We accrue the estimated cost of the uninsured portion of pending claims and an estimate for allocated loss adjustment expenses including legal and other direct costs associated with a claim. Estimates require judgments concerning the nature and severity of the claim, historical trends, advice from third-party administrators and insurers, the size of any potential damage award based on factors such as the specific facts of individual cases, the jurisdictions involved, the prospect of punitive damages, future medical costs, and inflation estimates of future claims development, and the legal and other costs to settle or defend the claims. We have significant exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims. If there is an increase in the frequency and severity of claims, or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts if the claims prove to be more severe than originally assessed, or any of the claims would exceed the limits of our insurance coverage, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nMaterial Debt Agreements\nFuel expense\nAccounting Standards adopted\nAlthough a portion of our tractors are protected by non-binding indicative trade-in values or binding trade-back agreements with the manufacturers, some tractors and substantially all of our owned trailers continue to be subject to fluctuations in market prices for used revenue equipment. Moreover, our trade-back agreements are contingent upon reaching acceptable terms for the purchase of new equipment. Further declines in the price of used revenue equipment or failure to reach agreement for the purchase of new tractors with the manufacturers issuing trade-back agreements could result in impairment of, or losses on the sale of, revenue equipment. Historically, only a de minimis percentage of our equipment has been sold back to the dealers pursuant to the trade back agreements as we have generally found that market prices exceeded the trade back allowances, although in recent years, trade back allowances have increased as a result of the increasing cost of the underlying equipment.\n\nIf claims development factors that are based upon historical experience change by 10%, our claims accrual as of December 31, 2017, would change by approximately $0.8 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation decreased approximately $1.1 million, or 0.9%, compared with 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased to 17.5% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 16.4% in 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased to 19.2% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 18.5% in 2015. These changes were primarily the result of a $0.7 million increase in payments to third-party transportation providers related to increased revenues for our Managed Freight segment and growth of our temperature-controlled intermodal service offering. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in leased equipment rental payments due to a reduction in our trailers under operating leases from 2,239 at December 31, 2015 to 1,695 at December 31, 2016. We expect revenue equipment rentals to decrease going forward as a result of our increase in acquisition of revenue equipment through financed purchases or capital leases rather than operating leases. As discussed below, this decrease may be partially or fully offset by an increase in purchased transportation as we expect to continue to grow our Managed Freight segment.\nUnallocated corporate overhead increased primarily as a result of increased salaries and wages, including workers' compensation expense, compared to the historic lows for workers' compensation in 2016, as well as non-driver headcount increases since 2016 and increased non-driver incentive compensation. Non-driver headcount increased in 2017 due to strategic initiatives in information technology.\nEffective April 2015, we entered into new auto liability policies with a three-year term. The policy includes a limit for a single loss of $9.0 million, an aggregate of $18.0 million for each policy year, and a $30.0 million aggregate for the 42 month term ended March 31, 2018. The policy includes a policy release premium refund of up to $14.6 million, less any future amounts paid on claims by the insurer, from October 1, 2014 through March 31, 2018, if we were to commute the policy for the entire 42 months. A decision with respect to commutation of the policy cannot be made before April 1, 2018, unless both we and the insurance carrier agree to a commutation prior to the end of the policy term. Management cannot predict whether or not future claims or the development of existing claims will justify a commutation, and accordingly, no related amounts were recorded at December 31, 2017.\nDepreciation of Revenue Equipment\nAccounting Standards not yet adopted\nFor 2018, we are forecasting sequential operating income improvement throughout the year. We believe the combination of an improving economy, tightening truckload supply dynamics, industry regulatory changes including the ELD mandate and its enforcement, depleting inventories, year-over-year net fuel expense savings from our improved fuel hedge positions, and further operational progress at SRT should deliver increased pre-tax earnings for the full year of 2018. In addition, we expect earnings improvement from the estimated favorable effective tax rate impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. We are currently estimating our 2018 effective income tax rate to be in the range of 24.0% to 27.0%. We expect year-over-year average freight revenue per truck to be positive by a mid-to-high single digit percentage, inflecting more positively later in the year as a large portion of annual contractual rate revisions are implemented during the second quarter of 2018. Our expectation of positive year-over-year pretax income includes higher employee wages for each quarter of 2018 versus comparable 2017 quarters. We also expect a decline in the operating income of our non-asset based logistics service offering to partially offset the forecasted operating income improvement for our Truckload service offering. Within the non-asset based logistics service offering, we expect some margin deterioration resulting from higher purchased transportation expense, coupled with planned investments in strategic employees and a new transport management system designed to enhance our supply chain services and growth potential. From a balance sheet perspective, with net capital expenditures scheduled to be below normal due to the timing of our expected replacement cycle, along with anticipated positive operating cash flows, we expect to further reduce combined balance sheet and off-balance sheet debt over the course of fiscal 2018.\nSalaries, wages, and related expenses decreased approximately $10.3 million, or 4.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, salaries, wages, and related expenses increased to 35.0% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 33.8% in 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, salaries, wages, and related expenses increased slightly to 38.4% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 38.2% in 2015. Salaries, wages, and related expenses decreased significantly on an overall dollar basis as a result of a 3.9% decrease in average tractors, but were relatively flat as a percentage of freight revenue, primarily due to pay adjustments for both driver and non-drivers since 2015, partially offset by a decrease in non-driver incentive compensation as a result of reduced profitability in 2016 versus 2015. Additionally, group insurance costs decreased approximately $2.3 million from 2015 as a result of better claims experience.\nThe rate of fuel price changes also can have an impact on results. Most fuel surcharges are based on the average fuel price as published by the DOE for the week prior to the shipment, meaning we typically bill customers in the current week based on the previous week's applicable index. Therefore, in times of increasing fuel prices, we do not recover as much as we are currently paying for fuel. In periods of declining prices, the opposite is true. Fuel prices as measured by the DOE averaged approximately $0.35 cents per gallon higher in 2017 than 2016 and $0.40 cents per gallon lower in 2016 than 2015.\nOperations and maintenance increased $2.9 million, or 6.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 2016. As a percentage of total revenue, operations and maintenance remained relatively flat at 6.9% of total revenue in 2017, compared with 6.8% in 2016. As a percentage of freight revenue, operations and maintenance increased to 7.8% of freight revenue for 2017, from 7.5% in 2016, primarily due to extending the trade cycle of our tractors in the second half of 2016, as well as unloading and other operational costs associated with our increase in dedicated freight that was added since the first quarter of 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, depreciation and amortization increased $11.1 million, or 18.0%, compared with 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, depreciation and amortization increased to 10.8% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 8.5% for 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, depreciation and amortization increased to 11.9% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 9.6% in 2015. Depreciation, consisting primarily of depreciation of revenue equipment and excluding gains and losses, increased $9.6 million in 2016 from 2015, primarily as a result of more owned equipment and a significant reduction on the value of used tractors resulting in a change to residual values. Losses on the disposal of property and equipment totaled $0.8 million in 2016, as compared to gains of $0.6 million in 2015.\nWe have two reportable segments, truckload services, which we refer to as Truckload. In addition, our Managed Freight segment has service offerings ancillary to our Truckload services, including: freight brokerage and logistics service provided both directly and through freight brokerage agents, who are paid a commission for the freight they provide. These operations consist of several operating segments, which are aggregated due to similar margins and customers. Included within Managed Freight is also our accounts receivable factoring business, which does not meet the aggregation criteria but only accounts for $3.1 million of revenue. The operation of each of these businesses is described in our notes to Item 1 of Part 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOperating taxes and licenses\nPursuant to applicable accounting standards, revenue equipment and other long-lived assets are tested for impairment whenever an event occurs that indicates impairment may exist. Expected future cash flows are used to analyze whether an impairment has occurred. If the sum of expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the long-lived asset, then an impairment loss is recognized. We measure the impairment loss by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. Fair value is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis or the appraised value of the assets, as appropriate.\nOur Truckload operating income was $37.1 million less in 2016 than 2015 due to the abovementioned decrease in freight revenue. Additionally, operating costs per mile, net of fuel surcharge revenue, increased primarily due to increased salaries, wages, and related expenses (which was primarily due to a higher percentage of our fleet being comprised of team-driven tractors, as well as driver and non-driver employee pay increases since the same 2015 period), increased net fuel expense, and increased capital costs, partially offset by reduced workers' compensation expense and operations and maintenance expense.\nWe expect purchased transportation to increase as we seek to grow our Managed Freight segment. In addition, if fuel prices continue to increase, it would result in a further increase in what we pay third party carriers and owner operators. However, this expense category will fluctuate with the number and percentage of loads hauled by owner operators, loads handled by Managed Freight, and tractors, trailers, and other assets financed with operating leases. In addition, factors such as the cost to obtain third party transportation services, and growth of our intermodal service offerings, and the amount of fuel surcharge revenue passed through to the third party carriers and owner operators will affect this expense category. If industry-wide trucking capacity were to tighten in relation to freight demand, we may need to increase the amounts we pay to third-party transportation providers, owner operators, and intermodal transportation providers, which could increase this expense category on an absolute basis and as a percentage of freight revenue absent an offsetting increase in revenue. We continue to actively recruit owner operators and, if we are successful, we would expect this line item to increase as a percentage of revenue. Further, we exited the temperature-controlled intermodal business in the fourth quarter of 2017 in order to focus on our objective to continue improvements at SRT. As a result, we expect purchased transportation costs at SRT to decrease going forward, which could partially offset any increase in consolidated purchased transportation.\n\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nOur Truckload revenue increased $11.6 million, as fuel surcharge revenue increased $18.4 million, offset by a decrease in freight revenue of $6.8 million. The decrease in freight revenue relates to a $4.2 million decrease in freight revenue contributed by our temperature-controlled intermodal service offering, a decrease in our average tractor fleet of 1.4% from 2016, partially offset by an increase in average freight revenue per tractor per week of 0.9% compared to 2016. The increase in average freight revenue per tractor per week is the result of a 2.1% increase, or 3.6 cents per mile, in average rate per total mile, partially offset by a 1.4% decrease in average miles per unit when compared to 2016. Team driven units decreased approximately 11.6% to an average of 912 teams in 2017 from 1,032 teams in 2016.\nFor the periods presented, the change in interest expense, net was not significant as either a percentage of total revenue or freight revenue.\n\nOur business requires significant capital investments over the short-term and the long-term. Recently, we have financed our capital requirements with borrowings under our Credit Facility, cash flows from operations, long-term operating leases, capital leases, secured installment notes with finance companies, and proceeds from the sale of our used revenue equipment. Going forward, we expect revenue equipment acquisitions through purchases and capital leases to increase as a percentage of our fleet as we decrease our use of operating leases. We had working capital (total current assets less total current liabilities) of $81.1 million and $47.9 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our working capital on any particular day can vary significantly due to the timing of collections and cash disbursements. Based on our expected financial condition, net capital expenditures, results of operations, related net cash flows, installment notes, and other sources of financing, we believe our working capital and sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our current and projected needs and we do not expect to experience material liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future.\nCapital lease obligations are utilized to finance a portion of our revenue equipment and are entered into with certain finance companies who are not parties to our Credit Facility. The leases in effect at December 31, 2017 terminate in January 2018 through September 2023 and contain guarantees of the residual value of the related equipment by us. As such, the residual guarantees are included in the related debt balance as a balloon payment at the end of the related term as well as included in the future minimum capital lease payments. These lease agreements require us to pay personal property taxes, maintenance, and operating expenses.\nGoing forward, we believe salaries, wages, and related expenses will increase as a result of a tight driver market, wage inflation, higher healthcare costs, and, in certain periods, increased incentive compensation due to better performance. In particular, we expect driver pay to increase as we look to reduce the number of unseated tractors in our fleet in a tight market for drivers. Additionally, when the freight market allows for an increase in rates we would expect to, as we have historically, pass a portion of those rate increases on to our professional drivers. Salaries, wages, and related expenses will fluctuate to some extent based on the percentage of revenue generated by owner operators and our Managed Freight segment, for which payments are reflected in the purchased transportation line item.\nWe expect to continue managing our idle time and tractor speeds, investing in more fuel-efficient tractors to improve our miles per gallon, locking in fuel hedges when deemed appropriate, and partnering with customers to adjust fuel surcharge programs that are inadequate to recover a fair portion of fuel costs. Going forward, our net fuel expense is expected to fluctuate as a percentage of revenue based on factors such as diesel fuel prices, percentage recovered from fuel surcharge programs, percentage of uncompensated miles, percentage of revenue generated by team-driven tractors (which tend to generate higher miles and lower revenue per mile, thus proportionately more fuel cost as a percentage of revenue), percentage of revenue generated by refrigerated operation (which uses diesel fuel for refrigeration, but usually does not recover fuel surcharges on refrigeration fuel), percentage of revenue generated from owner operators, the success of fuel efficiency initiatives, and gains and losses on fuel hedging contracts.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, total fuel expense decreased approximately $19.1 million, or 15.6%, compared with 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, total fuel expense decreased to 15.4% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 16.9% in 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, total fuel expense decreased to 16.9% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 19.1% in 2015. These decreases primarily related to lower fuel prices and an increase in our average fuel miles per gallon during 2016 as a result of purchasing equipment with more fuel-efficient engines. The decreases were partially offset by increased net losses from fuel hedging transactions of $16.7 million in 2016 compared to $13.9 million in 2015.\nThe new standard will require us to recognize revenue from loads proportionally as the transportation service is performed as opposed to recognizing revenue upon the completion of the load, which is our current practice. Our recognition of revenue under the new standard will approximate our recognition of revenue under the current standards, as there will generally be a consistent amount of freight in process at the beginning and end of the period; however, seasonality and the day on which the period ends may cause minor differences. We plan to transition to the new standard by recognizing the cumulative effect of adoption as an adjustment in the first quarter of 2018. We believe the cumulative effect of the adoption will result in a positive adjustment to retained earnings of approximately $0.6 million, net of tax, from initially recording in process revenue and associated direct expenses. We plan to finalize our evaluation during the first quarter of 2018, including an assessment of the new expanded disclosure requirements and a final determination of the impact to adoption and related changes required to internal controls.\nGoing forward, our cash flows may fluctuate depending on capital expenditures, the resolution of the 2008 cargo claim, future stock repurchases, strategic investments or divestitures, and the extent of future income tax obligations and refunds.\nIncome from equity method investment\nPricing for the revenue equipment installment notes is quoted by the respective financial affiliates of our primary revenue equipment suppliers and other lenders at the funding of each group of equipment acquired and include fixed annual rates for new equipment under retail installment contracts. The notes included in the funding are due in monthly installments with final maturities at various dates ranging from January 2018 to July 2023. The notes contain certain requirements regarding payment, insuring of collateral, and other matters, but do not have any financial or other material covenants or events of default except certain notes totaling $120.8 million are cross-defaulted with the Credit Facility. Additionally, our fuel hedge contracts totaling $0.8 million at December 31, 2017, are cross-defaulted with the Credit Facility. Additional borrowings from the financial affiliates of our primary revenue equipment suppliers and other lenders are expected to be available to fund new tractors expected to be delivered in 2018, while any other property and equipment purchases, including trailers, are expected to be funded with a combination of available cash, notes, operating leases, capital leases, and/or from the Credit Facility.\nThe primary claims arising against us consist of auto liability (personal injury and property damage), workers' compensation, cargo, commercial liability, and employee medical expenses. Our insurance program involves self-insurance with the following risk retention levels (before giving effect to any commutation of an auto liability policy):\nOur Truckload revenue decreased $54.7 million, as freight revenue decreased $30.4 million and fuel surcharge revenue decreased $24.3 million. The decrease in freight revenue relates to a decrease in average freight revenue per tractor per week of 2.2% compared to 2015, partially offset by a $1.7 million increase in freight revenue contributed by our temperature-controlled intermodal service offering, as well as a decrease in our average tractor fleet of 3.9% from 2015. The decrease in average freight revenue per tractor per week is the result of a 1.3% decrease, or 2.2 cents per mile, in average rate per total mile and a 0.6% decrease in average miles per unit when compared to 2015. Additionally, team driven units increased approximately 5.3% to an average of approximately 1,000 teams in 2016 compared to approximately 950 in 2015.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We believe the future tax deductions will be realized principally through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income, except for when a valuation allowance has been provided.\nInsurance and claims increased approximately $0.7 million, or 2.2%, for year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, insurance and claims increased to 4.9% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 4.4% in 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, insurance and claims increased to 5.3% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 5.0% in 2015. These increases are primarily related to the $3.6 million benefit in the second quarter of 2015 from commutation of our auto liability policy for the period from April 1, 2013, through September 30, 2014. These increases also resulted from increased accident severity, resulting in total insurance cost increasing to 10.3 cents per mile for 2016 from 9.6 cents per mile in 2015. These increases were partially offset by decreased accident rates in 2016, as measured by a 6.8% improvement in DOT reportable accidents per million miles driven at 0.82% - the second lowest in the last ten years.\nIn the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions. We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management's evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense.\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities were $82.9 million in 2017 compared with $102.4 million in 2016 primarily due to the change in receivables and advances related to the timing of revenue and the related collections at the beginning of each period and the timing of cash collections on our other receivables in 2017 compared to 2016. These declines are partially offset by net income of $55.4 million in 2017 compared to net income of $16.8 million in 2016, of which approximately $40.1 million relates to the one-time remeasurement of deferred taxes due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The fluctuations in cash flows from accounts payable and accrued expenses primarily related to the timing of payments on our accrued expenses and trade accounts in the 2017 period compared to the 2016 period.\n\nInsurance and Other Claims\nFor comparison purposes in the discussion below, we use total revenue and freight revenue (total revenue less fuel surcharge revenue) when discussing changes as a percentage of revenue. As it relates to the comparison of expenses to freight revenue, we believe removing fuel surcharge revenue, which is sometimes a volatile source of revenue, affords a more consistent basis for comparing the results of operations from period-to-period. Nonetheless, freight revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not a substitute for revenue measured in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures. Our Board and management focus on our freight revenue as an indicator of our performance from period to period. We believe our presentation of freight revenue is useful because it provides investors and securities analysts the same information that we use internally to assess our core operating performance. Although we believe that freight revenue improves comparability in analyzing our period-to-period performance, it could limit comparability to other companies in our industry, if those companies define freight revenue differently. Because of these limitations, freight revenue should not be considered a measure of total revenue generated by or available to our business. Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures on a supplemental basis.\nRevenue Recognition\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation for book purposes is determined using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, while depreciation for tax purposes is generally recorded using an accelerated method. Depreciation of revenue equipment is our largest item of depreciation. We generally depreciate new tractors (excluding day cabs) over five years to salvage values of approximately 15% of their cost and new trailers over seven years for refrigerated trailers and ten years for dry van trailers to salvage values of approximately 25% of their cost. We annually review the reasonableness of our estimates regarding useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and other long-lived assets based upon, among other things, our experience with similar assets, conditions in the used revenue equipment market, and prevailing industry practice. Over the past several years, the price of new tractors has risen dramatically and there has been significant volatility in the used equipment market. As a result of the progressive decline in the market value of used tractors and our expectations that used tractor prices will not rebound in the near term, effective July 1, 2016 we reduced the salvage values on our tractors and, thus, prospectively increased depreciation expense. Estimates around the salvage values and useful lives for trailers remain unchanged. The impact from the third quarter of 2016 through 2017 was approximately $2.0 million per quarter of additional depreciation expense in subsequent quarters, or approximately $1.2 million per quarter net of tax, which represents approximately $0.06 per common or diluted share. We expect depreciation levels in 2018 to approximate those of 2017. Changes in the useful life or salvage value estimates, or fluctuations in market values that are not reflected in our estimates, could have a material effect on our results of operations. Gains and losses on the disposal of revenue equipment are included in depreciation expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nWe and substantially all of our subsidiaries (collectively, the \"Borrowers\") are parties to a Third Amended and Restated Credit Facility (the \"Credit Facility\") with Bank of America, N.A., as agent (the \"Agent\") and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\"JPM,\" and together with the Agent, the \"Lenders\").\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09. The new standard introduces a five-step model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The premise of the new model is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard will be effective for us for our annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Entities are allowed to transition to the new standard by either recasting prior periods or recognizing the cumulative effect.\nGeneral supplies and expenses\nAll such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Annual Report. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any change in the events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\n\nThe decrease in 2016 Truckload revenue relates to a decrease in average freight revenue per tractor per week of 2.2% compared to 2015 and a decrease in our average tractor fleet of 3.9% from 2015, partially offset by a $1.7 million increase in freight revenue contributed by our temperature-controlled intermodal service offering. The decrease in average freight revenue per tractor per week is the result of a 1.3% decrease, or 2.2 cents per mile, in average rate per total mile and a 0.6% decrease in average miles per unit when compared to 2015. Team driven units increased approximately 5.3% to an average of approximately 1,000 teams in 2016 from approximately 950 teams in 2015.\nWe also make judgments regarding the ultimate benefit versus risk of commuting certain periods within our auto liability policy. If we commute a policy, we assume 100% risk for covered claims in exchange for a policy refund. In April 2015, we commuted two liability policies for the period from April 1, 2013 through September 30, 2014, such that we are now responsible for any claim that occurred during that period up to $20.0 million, should such a claim develop. We recorded a $3.6 million reduction in insurance and claims expense in the second quarter of 2015 related to the commutation. The insurer did not remit the premium refund directly to the Company, but rather applied a credit to the current auto liability insurance policy, such that we recorded the policy release premium refund as a prepaid asset at June 30, 2015.\nGoing forward, we believe this category will fluctuate based on several factors, including our continued ability to maintain a relatively young fleet, accident severity and frequency, weather, and the reliability of new and untested revenue equipment models.\n\nIn August 2015, we financed a portion of the purchase of our corporate headquarters, a maintenance facility, and certain surrounding property in Chattanooga, Tennessee by entering into a $28.0 million variable rate note with a third party lender. Concurrently with entering into the note, we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively fix the related interest rate to 4.2%. See Note 13 for further information about the interest rate swap.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2016 to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nCash Flows\nLease Accounting and Off-Balance Sheet Transactions\nWe issue several types of stock-based compensation, including awards that vest based on service and performance conditions or a combination of the conditions. Performance-based awards vest contingent upon meeting certain performance criteria established by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. For performance-based awards, determining the appropriate amount to expense in each period is based on likelihood and timing of achieving the stated targets and requires judgment, including forecasting future financial results. The estimates are revised periodically based on the probability and timing of achieving the required performance targets and adjustments are made as appropriate. Awards that are only subject to time vesting provisions are amortized using the straight-line method.\nThis line item will fluctuate based on our decision with respect to purchasing revenue equipment with balance sheet debt versus operating leases as well as our ability to continue to generate profitable results and reduce our leverage.\nNet fuel expense increased $3.7 million, or 8.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, net fuel expense increased 0.9% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015. These increases primarily resulted from lower fuel surcharge recovery as a result of increased broker freight and the tiered reimbursement structure of certain fuel surcharge agreements. The increases were partially offset by improved miles per gallon due to new engine technology, internal fuel efficiency initiatives, and a greater percentage of miles driven by owner operators, where we pay a rate that reflects then-existing fuel prices and we do not have the natural hedge created by fuel surcharge.\nThe following table sets forth total revenue and freight revenue (total revenue less fuel surcharge revenue) for the periods indicated:\nWith an average tractor fleet age of 2.1 years, we believe we have flexibility to manage our fleet and we plan to regularly evaluate our tractor replacement cycle, new tractor purchase requirements, and financing options.\nThe increase in Managed Freight revenue is primarily the result of improved coordination with our Truckload segment, additional business from new customers added during the year, and the full year effect of a large customer added in 2015.\nOperating taxes and licenses decreased approximately $1.8 million, or 15.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 2016. As a percentage of total revenue, operating taxes and licenses decreased to 1.4% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 1.7% in 2016. As a percentage of freight revenue, operating taxes and licenses decreased to 1.6% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 1.9% in 2016. The decrease in operating taxes and licenses, including as a percentage of total revenue and freight revenue, is primarily due to the settlement of a property tax matter that resulted in a decrease of a prior year's assessment and related refund, as well as a lower truck count.\nIn 2017 and 2016 we had net losses on revenue equipment of $4.0 million and $0.8 million, respectively, and in 2015 we generated net gains on revenue equipment, including assets held for sale, of $0.6 million. We review salvage values of our revenue equipment annually and make adjustments periodically, based on trends in the used equipment market, to reflect updated estimates of fair value at disposal.\nIn addition to estimates within our self-insured retention layers, we also must make judgments concerning claims where we have third party insurance and for claims outside our coverage limits. Upon settling claims and expenses associated with claims where we have third party coverage, we are generally required to initially fund payment to the claimant and seek reimbursement from the insurer. Receivables from insurers for claims and expenses we have paid on behalf of insurers were $1.1 million and $0.7 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and are included in drivers' advances and other receivables on our consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, we accrue claims above our self-insured retention and record a corresponding receivable for amounts we expect to collect from insurers upon settlement of such claims. We have $2.1 million and less than $0.1 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as a receivable in other assets and as a corresponding accrual in the long-term portion of insurance and claims accruals on our consolidated balance sheet for claims above our self-insured retention for which we believe it is reasonably assured that the insurers will provide their portion of such claims. We evaluate collectability of the receivables based on the credit worthiness and surplus of the insurers, along with our prior experience and contractual terms with each. If any claim occurrence were to exceed our aggregate coverage limits, we would have to accrue for the excess amount. Our critical estimates include evaluating whether a claim may exceed such limits and, if so, by how much. If one or more claims were to exceed our then effective coverage limits, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2017 to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRevenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased approximately $24.5 million, or 20.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 2016. As a percentage of total revenue, revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased to 20.1% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 17.5% in 2016. As a percentage of freight revenue, revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased to 22.6% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 19.2% in 2016. These changes were primarily the result of a $19.8 million increase in payments to third-party transportation providers primarily related to increased revenues for our Managed Freight segment and the increased need for outside capacity to meet the demands of peak season for our Truckload services. Additionally, the percentage of the total miles run by owner-operators increased from 9.7% for 2016 to 10.3% for 2017. These increases were partially offset by reduced expenses resulting from a reduction and subsequent elimination of our temperature-controlled intermodal service offering.\nSEASONALITY\nIn addition to operating ratio, we use \"adjusted operating ratio\" as a key measure of profitability. Adjusted operating ratio means operating expenses, net of fuel surcharge revenue, expressed as a percentage of revenue, excluding fuel surcharge revenue. Adjusted operating ratio is not a substitute for operating ratio measured in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the use of adjusted operating ratio allows us to more effectively compare periods, while excluding the potentially volatile effect of changes in fuel prices. Our Board and management focus on our adjusted operating ratio as an indicator of our performance from period to period. We believe our presentation of adjusted operating ratio is useful because it provides investors and securities analysts the same information that we use internally to assess our core operating performance. Although we believe that adjusted operating ratio improves comparability in analyzing our period-to-period performance, it could limit comparability to other companies in our industry, if those companies define adjusted operating ratio differently. Because of these limitations, adjusted operating ratio should not be considered a measure of income generated by our business or discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures on a supplemental basis.\nNet fuel expense decreased $16.6 million, or 33.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. As a percentage of freight revenue, net fuel expense decreased 2.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. These decreases primarily resulted from higher fuel surcharge recovery as a result of decreased broker freight and the tiered reimbursement structure of certain fuel surcharge agreements. The decreases were partially offset by a greater percentage of miles driven by owner operators, where we pay a rate that reflects then-existing fuel prices and we do not have the natural hedge created by fuel surcharge.\nFor the 2016 year compared to 2015, the change in operating taxes and licenses was not significant as either a percentage of total revenue or freight revenue.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, operations and maintenance decreased $0.6 million, or 1.3%, compared with 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, operations and maintenance remained relatively flat at 6.8% of total revenue in 2016, compared with 6.4% in 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, operations and maintenance increased to 7.5% of freight revenue for 2016, from 7.3% in 2015 due to an increase in unloading and other operational costs associated with our increase in dedicated freight, partially offset by lower maintenance cost on our revenue equipment.\nItem 7, as well as other items of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, contains certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and such statements are subject to the safe harbor created by those sections and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical or current fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including without limitation: any projections of earnings, revenues, or other financial items; any statement of plans, strategies, and objectives of management for future operations; any statements concerning proposed new services or developments; any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance; any statements of belief; and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. In this Item 7, statements relating to future demand for and supply of new and used tractors and trailers (including expected prices of such equipment), expected sources and adequacy of working capital and liquidity, future relationships, use, compensation, and availability with respect to third-party service providers, future driver market conditions, future allocation of capital, expected settlement of operating lease obligations, future asset sales and acquisitions, future insurance, litigation, and claims levels and expenses, future tax rates, expense, and deductions, future fuel management, expense, and the future effectiveness of fuel surcharge programs and price hedges, future interest rates and effectiveness of interest rate swaps, expected capital expenditures (including the future mix of lease and purchase obligations), future trucking capacity, expected freight demand and volumes, future rates, future depreciation and amortization, future compliance with and impact of existing and proposed federal and state laws and regulations, future salaries, wages, and other employee benefit expenses, future earnings from and value of our investments, future customer relationships, future defaults under debt agreements, future payment of financing and lease liabilities, future performance of our subsidiaries, future credit availability, including expected borrowing base increases in our credit facility, expected transition to and effect of new accounting standards, expected effect of remeasured deferred tax assets, and future operating and maintenance expenses, among others, are forward-looking statements. Such statements may be identified by their use of terms or phrases such as \"believe,\" \"may,\" \"could,\" \"expects,\" \"estimates,\" \"projects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"plans,\" \"intends,\" and similar terms and phrases. Forward-looking statements are based on currently available operating, financial, and competitive information. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, which could cause future events and actual results to differ materially from those set forth in, contemplated by, or underlying the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section entitled \"Item 1A. Risk Factors,\" set forth above. Readers should review and consider the factors discussed in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors,\" along with various disclosures in our press releases, stockholder reports, and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nUnallocated corporate overhead remained relatively flat as a result of a $3.2 million reduction in incentive compensation in 2016, primarily as a result of decreased profitability, partially offset by the 2015 period including the $3.6 million in return of previously expensed insurance premiums for the commutation of our primary auto liability policy for the period of April 1, 2013, through September 30, 2014.\nNet cash flows used by investing activities were $62.1 million in 2017 compared with $47.3 million in 2016. The $14.8 million increase in net investing activities was attributable primarily to a $16.8 million decrease in proceeds from dispositions of used revenue equipment which primarily resulted from the timing and dispositions of assets held for sale as well as our decision to extend the trade cycle of our current equipment. During 2018 we plan to take delivery of approximately 510 new company tractors and dispose of approximately 500 used tractors. This compares to the approximately 635 new company tractors we took delivery of and the approximately 615 used tractors we disposed of during 2017. Going forward, cash flows from disposals of equipment could be more volatile given the weakness in the used tractor market.\nInsurance and claims, consisting primarily of premiums and deductible amounts for liability, physical damage, and cargo damage insurance and claims, increased approximately $0.6 million, or 1.7%, for year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 2016. As a percentage of total revenue, insurance and claims decreased to 4.7% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 4.9% in 2016. As a percentage of freight revenue, insurance and claims remained flat at 5.3% of freight revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The change in total revenue resulted from increased accident severity early in 2017, partially offset by an 8.2% improvement in DOT reportable accidents per million miles driven for the 2017 year. Total insurance cost increased to 10.7 cents per mile for 2017 from 10.3 cents per mile in 2016.\n \u25cf Total revenue was $705.0 million, compared with $670.7 million for 2016, and freight revenue (which excludes revenue from fuel surcharges) was $626.8 million, compared with $610.8 million for 2016; \u25cf Operating income was $28.1 million, compared with operating income of $32.4 million for 2016; \u25cf Net income was $55.4 million, or $3.02 per diluted share, compared with net income of $16.8 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, for 2016; \u25cf Our equity investment in TEL provided $3.4 million of pre-tax earnings in 2017, compared to $3.0 million for 2016; and \u25cf Stockholders' equity and tangible book value at December 31, 2017, were $295.2 million, or $16.11 per basic share. \n\"Unallocated Corporate Overhead\" includes costs that are incidental to our activities and are not specifically allocated to one of the segments. The following table summarizes financial and operating data by segment:\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nFor the periods presented, the changes in communications and utilities were not significant as either a percentage of total revenue or freight revenue.\n\nStock-Based Employee Compensation\nWe receive a fuel surcharge on our loaded miles from most shippers; however, this does not cover the entire increase in fuel prices for several reasons, including the following: surcharges cover only loaded miles we operate; surcharges do not cover miles driven out-of-route by our drivers; and surcharges typically do not cover refrigeration unit fuel usage or fuel burned by tractors while idling. Moreover, most of our business relating to shipments obtained from freight brokers does not carry a fuel surcharge. Finally, fuel surcharges vary in the percentage of reimbursement offered, and not all surcharges fully compensate for fuel price increases even on loaded miles.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility are subject to a borrowing base limited to the lesser of (A) $95.0 million, minus the sum of the stated amount of all outstanding letters of credit; or (B) the sum of (i) 85% of eligible accounts receivable, plus (ii) the lesser of (a) 85% of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible revenue equipment, (b) 95% of the net book value of eligible revenue equipment, or (c) 35% of the Lenders' aggregate revolving commitments under the Credit Facility, plus (iii) the lesser of (a) $25.0 million or (b) 65% of the appraised fair market value of eligible real estate, as reduced by a periodic amortization amount. We had $9.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2017, undrawn letters of credit outstanding of approximately $32.9 million, and available borrowing capacity of $53.1 million. The interest rate on outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2017, was 5.0% on less than $0.1 million of base rate loans and 3.1% on $9.0 million of LIBOR loans. Based on availability as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, there was no fixed charge coverage requirement.\nTotal fuel expense remained flat for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 2016. As a percentage of total revenue, total fuel expense decreased to 14.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 15.4% in 2016. As a percentage of freight revenue, total fuel expense decreased to 16.5% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 16.9% in 2016. These increases primarily related to higher fuel prices in 2017, offset by net losses from fuel hedging transactions of $4.1 million in 2017 compared to $16.7 million in 2016.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nThe following table sets forth our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2017:\nRevenue, drivers' wages, and other direct operating expenses generated by our Truckload reportable segment are recognized on the date shipments are delivered to the customer. Revenue includes transportation revenue, fuel surcharges, loading and unloading activities, equipment detention, and other accessorial services.\nFor 2017, total revenue increased $34.4 million, or 5.1%, to $705.0 million from $670.7 million in 2016. Freight revenue increased $16.0 million, or 2.6%, to $626.8 million for 2017, from $610.8 million in 2016, while fuel surcharge revenue increased $18.4 million year-over-year. The increase in freight revenue resulted from a $22.8 million increase in revenues from Managed Freight, partially offset by a $6.8 million decrease in freight revenue from our Truckload segment.\nWe issue residual value guarantees in connection with the operating leases we enter into for certain of our revenue equipment. These leases provide that if we do not purchase the leased equipment from the lessor at the end of the lease term, then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the equipment and an agreed value. To the extent the expected value at the lease termination date is lower than the residual value guarantee, we would accrue for the difference over the remaining lease term. We believe that proceeds from the sale of equipment under operating leases would equal or exceed the payment obligation on substantially all operating leases. The estimated values at lease termination involve management judgments. As leases are entered into, determination as to the classification as an operating or capital lease involves management judgments on residual values and useful lives.\nCommunications and utilities\n\nWe periodically utilize derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in fuel prices and interest rates. At inception of a derivative contract, we document relationships between derivative instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various derivative transactions, and assess hedge effectiveness. We record derivative financial instruments in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability at fair value. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. The changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nOur auto liability (personal injury and property damage), cargo, and general liability insurance programs include significant self-insured retention amounts. The auto liability policy contains a feature whereby we are able to retroactively obtain a partial refund of the premium in exchange for taking on the liability for incidents that occurred during the period and releasing the insurers. This is referred to as \"commuting\" the policy or \"policy commutation.\" In several past periods, including the policy period from April 1, 2013, through September 30, 2014, commuted in 2015, we have commuted the policy, which has lowered our insurance and claims expense. We are also self-insured for physical damage to our equipment. Because of these significant self-insured exposures, insurance and claims expense may fluctuate significantly from period-to-period. Any increase in frequency or severity of claims, or any increases to then-existing reserves, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We have accrued a reserve in connection with a judgment that was rendered against us based on a 2008 cargo claim. We recorded an additional $0.9 million of expense in the first quarter of 2017 in order to accrue additional legal fees and pre-judgment interest since the time of our previous appeal. We are currently pursuing a second appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals related to the District Court's decision on damages. If these further proceedings are resolved favorably to us, any reduction of the accrual could reduce insurance and claims expense in the period in which the claim is resolved. On the other hand, if the proceedings are not resolved favorably, insurance and claims expense may increase as a result of continuing litigation expenses, including pre and post judgment interest. We periodically evaluate strategies to efficiently reduce our insurance and claims expense, which in the past have included the commutation of our auto liability insurance policy. We intend to evaluate our ability to commute the current policy and any such commutation could significantly impact insurance and claims expense.\nRevenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make decisions based upon estimates, assumptions, and factors we consider as relevant to the circumstances. Such decisions include the selection of applicable accounting principles and the use of judgment in their application, the results of which impact reported amounts and disclosures. Changes in future economic conditions or other business circumstances may affect the outcomes of our estimates and assumptions. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those anticipated. A summary of the significant accounting policies followed in preparation of the financial statements is contained in Note 1, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" of the consolidated financial statements attached hereto. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates.\nDepreciation and amortization consists primarily of depreciation of tractors, trailers and other capital assets offset or increased, as applicable, by gains or losses on dispositions of capital assets. Depreciation and amortization in 2017 increased $4.0 million, or 5.5%, compared with 2016. As a percentage of total revenue, depreciation and amortization remained flat at 10.8% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. As a percentage of freight revenue, depreciation and amortization increased to 12.2% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 11.9% in 2016. Depreciation, consisting primarily of depreciation of revenue equipment and excluding gains and losses, increased $0.8 million in 2017 from 2016, primarily as a result of the full year effect of the decreased salvage values implemented in 2016. Additionally, the soft used truck market contributed to losses on the sale of property and equipment of $4.0 million in 2017 compared to losses of $0.8 million in 2016.\nIn February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which requires lessees to recognize a right-to-use asset and a lease obligation for all leases. Lessees are permitted to make an accounting policy election to not recognize an asset and liability for leases with a term of twelve months or less. Lessor accounting under the new standard is substantially unchanged. Additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures, including significant judgments made by management, will be required. This new standard will become effective for us in our annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period and requires a modified retrospective transition approach. We are currently evaluating the impacts the adoption of this standard will have on the consolidated financial statements.\nInterest expense, net\nNet cash flows used in financing activities were $13.2 million in 2017 compared to $51.9 million in 2016, primarily as a function of net repayments, in 2016, of notes payable facilitated by cash flows primarily related to the trade cycle of our revenue equipment. In particular, this decrease reflects the sale of the previously noted 615 tractors in the 2017 compared to 1,074 tractors in 2016.\nFor 2016, total revenue decreased $53.6 million, or 7.4%, to $670.7 million from $724.2 million in 2015. Freight revenue decreased $29.3 million, or 4.6%, to $610.8 million for 2016, from $640.1 million in 2015, while fuel surcharge revenue decreased $24.3 million year-over-year. The decrease in freight revenue resulted from a $30.4 million decrease in freight revenue from our Truckload segment, partially offset by a $1.1 million increase in revenues from Managed Freight.\nOperations and maintenance\nOperating leases are an important source of financing for our revenue equipment and certain real estate. At December 31, 2017, we had financed 234 tractors and 967 trailers under operating leases. Vehicles held under operating leases are not carried on our consolidated balance sheets, and lease payments, in respect of such vehicles, are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations in the line item \"Revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation.\" Our revenue equipment rental expense was $12.1 million in 2017, compared with $10.6 million in 2016. The total value of remaining payments under operating leases as of December 31, 2017, was approximately $18.6 million. In connection with various operating leases, we issued residual value guarantees, which provide that if we do not purchase the leased equipment from the lessor at the end of the lease term, we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the equipment and an agreed value. The residual guarantees expire between August 2018 and February 2019 and had an undiscounted value of approximately $4.0 million at December 31, 2017. The discounted present value of the total remaining lease payments and residual value guarantees were approximately $21.7 million at December 31, 2017. We expect our residual guarantees to approximate the market value at the end of the lease term. We believe that proceeds from the sale of equipment under operating leases would equal or exceed the payment obligation on substantially all operating leases.\nWe expect depreciation and amortization to stabilize as the impact of the significant 2016 reductions in residual values will flatten on a comparative basis going forward. Additionally, if the used tractor market were to decline further, we could have to adjust residual values again and increase depreciation or experience increased losses on sale.\nWe are encouraged by our continued profitability and we continue to focus on our turnaround efforts at SRT, which realized a more than a 400 basis point improvement in its operating margin compared to 2016. We are also continuing to deleverage our balance sheet, resulting in total indebtedness, net of cash and including the present value of off-balance sheet lease obligations, decreasing approximately $6.6 million since December 31, 2016. Additionally, earnings included the approximately $40.1 million favorable effective tax rate impact from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and the reduced negative impact of the fuel hedges have increased tangible book value per basic share 24.4% to $16.11 from $12.95 at December 31, 2016.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRevenue generated by our Managed Freight segment is recognized upon completion of the services provided. Revenue is recorded on a gross basis, without deducting third party purchased transportation costs, as we act as a principal with substantial risks as primary obligor, except for transactions whereby equipment from our Truckload segment perform the related services, which we record on a net basis in accordance with the related authoritative guidance. Managed Freight revenue includes $3.1 million, $2.6 million, and $2.4 million of revenue in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, related to an accounts receivable factoring business. Revenue for this business is recognized on a net basis, given we are acting as an agent and are not the primary obligor in these transactions.", "item_7_text": "Managed Freight total revenue increased $22.8 million in 2017 compared to 2016 and Managed Freight operating income increased $1.0 million in 2017 compared to 2016. These improvements are primarily the result of spot market opportunities related to the hurricane-affected regions during 2017 and growth with existing customers compared to 2016.\nFor the periods presented, the changes in communications and utilities were not significant as either a percentage of total revenue or freight revenue.\n\nWhile we have generally been pleased with recent profitability levels and operational improvements, particularly at SRT, we still have work ahead as operating results were behind those of 2016. Additionally, we were disappointed with our fourth quarter peak season for the second consecutive year. In addition to managing our operating costs, we continue to evaluate the most effective level of participation in the peak season and the manner of allocating our assets and coordinating third party capacity. We remain committed to providing peak capacity for our customers; however, we will need to challenge our pricing models to ensure we are appropriately rewarded for our efforts related to this valuable annual shipping period.\nThe effective tax rate is different from the expected combined tax rate due primarily to permanent differences related to our per diem pay structure for drivers. Due to the partial nondeductible effect of the per diem payments, our tax rate will fluctuate in future periods as income fluctuates. Our effective tax rate for 2017 was an anomaly due to the nonrecurring remeasurement of deferred taxes noted above related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. We are currently estimating our 2018 effective income tax rate to be in the range of 24.0% to 27.0%.\nSalaries, wages, and related expenses\nDepreciation and amortization\n (1) Represents principal owed at December 31, 2017 and interest on such principal amount through maturity. The borrowings consist of draws under our Credit Facility, with fluctuating borrowing amounts and variable interest rates. In determining future contractual interest and principal obligations, for variable interest rate debt, the interest rate and principal amount in place at December 31, 2017, was utilized. The table assumes long-term debt is held to maturity. Refer to Note 7, \"Debt\" of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. (2) Represents principal and interest payments owed at December 31, 2017. The borrowings consist of installment notes with finance companies, with fixed borrowing amounts and fixed interest rates, except for a variable rate real estate note, for which the interest rate is effectively fixed through an interest rate swap. The table assumes these installment notes are held to maturity. Refer to Note 7, \"Debt\" of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. (3) Represents future monthly rental payment obligations under operating leases for tractors, trailers, and terminal properties, and computer and office equipment. Substantially all lease agreements for revenue equipment have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. The tractor lease agreements generally stipulate maximum miles and provide for mileage penalties for excess miles. These leases generally run for a period of three to five years for tractors and five to seven years for trailers. Refer to Note 8, \"Leases\" of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. (4) Represents principal and interest payments owed at December 31, 2017. The borrowings consist of capital leases with one finance company, with fixed borrowing amounts and fixed interest rates or rates that are floating but effectively fixed through related interest rate swaps. Borrowings in 2018 and thereafter include the residual value guarantees on the related equipment as balloon payments. Refer to Note 7, \"Debt\" of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. (5) Represents purchase obligations for revenue equipment totaling approximately $51.7 million in 2017. These commitments are cancelable, subject to certain adjustments in the underlying obligations and benefits. These purchase commitments are expected to be financed by operating leases, capital leases, long-term debt, proceeds from sales of existing equipment, and/or cash flows from operations. Refer to Notes 7 and 8, \"Debt\" and \"Leases,\" respectively, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. (6) Excludes any amounts accrued for unrecognized tax benefits as we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of such unrecognized tax benefits. \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nIncome tax expense decreased approximately $11.4 million, or 52.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, income tax expense decreased to 1.5% of total revenue for 2016 from 3.0% in 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, income tax expense decreased to 1.7% of freight revenue for 2016 compared to 3.4% in 2015. These decreases were primarily related to the $36.7 million decrease in pre-tax income in 2016 compared to 2015 resulting from the declines in operating income noted above, the decrease in the contribution from TEL's earnings, and the large non-recurring tax credit in fiscal year 2015.\n\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\nThe Credit Facility includes usual and customary events of default for a facility of this nature and provides that, upon the occurrence and continuation of an event of default, payment of all amounts payable under the Credit Facility may be accelerated, and the Lenders' commitments may be terminated. If an event of default occurs under the Credit Facility and the Lenders cause all of the outstanding debt obligations under the Credit Facility to become due and payable, this could result in a default under other debt instruments that contain acceleration or cross-default provisions. The Credit Facility contains certain restrictions and covenants relating to, among other things, debt, dividends, liens, acquisitions and dispositions outside of the ordinary course of business, and affiliate transactions. Failure to comply with the covenants and restrictions set forth in the Credit Facility could result in an event of default.\nIn August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued ASU 2017-12, which among other things, eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and requires all items that affect earnings to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. The ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. We have adopted the standard for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. Entities adopting the ASU must apply a cumulative-effect adjustment related to the elimination of the separate hedge ineffectiveness measurement. No adjustment was required, however, since no hedge ineffectiveness has been recorded. We have adopted the amended presentation and disclosure guidance, which is required only prospectively.\nRESULTS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS\nMost of our operating expenses are inflation-sensitive, with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations. In recent years, the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices and the related depreciation, health care, and driver and non-driver wages. New emissions control regulations and increases in wages of manufacturing workers and other items have resulted in higher tractor prices, while the decline in the market value of used equipment significantly reduced the residual values of units in fiscal 2015 through 2017. The cost of fuel has been extremely volatile over the last several years, with costs increasing slightly in 2017 after significant decreases in both 2016 and 2015. We believe at least some of this volatility reflects the fluctuations in the U.S. dollar and global demand for petroleum products, unrest in certain oil-producing countries, improved fuel efficiency due to technological advancements, and an increase in domestic supply. Health care prices have increased faster than general inflation, primarily due to the rapid increase in prescription drug costs and more people on our health plan in order to comply with the individual healthcare mandate. The nationwide shortage of qualified drivers has caused us to raise driver wages per mile at a rate faster than general inflation for the past four years, and this trend may continue as additional government regulations constrain industry capacity. Additionally, competition and the related cost to employ non-drivers have increased, especially for the more skilled or technical positions, including mechanics, those with information technology related skills, and degreed professionals.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nRevenue\n\nTo measure the effectiveness of our fuel surcharge program, we subtract fuel surcharge revenue (other than the fuel surcharge revenue we reimburse to owner operators and other third parties, which is included in purchased transportation) from our fuel expense. The result is referred to as net fuel expense. Our net fuel expense as a percentage of freight revenue is affected by the cost of diesel fuel net of fuel surcharge collection, the percentage of miles driven by company tractors, our fuel economy, and our percentage of deadhead miles, for which we do not receive material fuel surcharge revenues. Net fuel expense is shown below:\nIf capacity tightens as a result of regulations impacting the industry or economic growth, we expect the pricing environment to improve into 2018 and 2019, offset in part by higher driver pay and other inflationary costs. Further, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we exited the temperature-controlled intermodal business, which provided $11.0 million of total revenue in 2017, in order to focus on our objective to continue improvements at SRT, which could result in more muted revenue growth at SRT.\nWe lease certain revenue equipment under capital leases with terms of approximately 60 to 84 months. Amortization of leased assets is included in depreciation and amortization expense.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $9.0 million of borrowings outstanding, undrawn letters of credit outstanding of approximately $32.9 million, and available borrowing capacity of $53.1 million under the Credit Facility. Fluctuations in the outstanding balance and related availability under our Credit Facility are driven primarily by cash flows from operations and the timing and nature of property and equipment additions that are not funded through notes payable, as well as the nature and timing of collection of accounts receivable, payments of accrued expenses, and receipt of proceeds from disposals of property and equipment. Unless we decide to make any strategic investments during the year, we anticipate paying off an aggregate of approximately $40.0 to $60.0 million of financing and lease liabilities, comprised of both on and off balance sheet obligations, during 2018.\nOur annual operating ratio deteriorated 80 basis points to 96.0%. Our adjusted operating ratio (as defined below), a key measure of profitability in our industry, also deteriorated 80 basis points to a 95.5%. These unfavorable changes were primarily the result of the significantly more expensive third-party capacity during the latter portion of the year, affecting our Managed Freight and Truckload segments, as well as increased employee wages and increased capital costs compared to 2016. Our consolidated financial results are summarized as follows:\nThe decrease in 2017 Truckload revenue relates to a $4.2 million decrease in freight revenue contributed by our temperature-controlled intermodal service offering, a decrease in our average tractor fleet of 1.4% from 2016, partially offset by an increase in average freight revenue per tractor per week of 0.9% compared to 2016. The increase in average freight revenue per tractor per week is the result of a 2.1% increase, or 3.6 cents per mile, in average rate per total mile, partially offset by a 1.4% decrease in average miles per unit when compared to 2016. Team driven units decreased approximately 11.6% to an average of 912 teams in 2017 from 1,032 teams in 2016.\nInsurance and claims\nGiven recent historical lows, we would expect diesel fuel prices to increase over the next few years. We are continuing our efforts to increase our ability to recover fuel surcharges under our customer contracts for fuel used in refrigeration units. If these efforts are successful, it could give rise to an increase in fuel surcharges recovered and a corresponding decrease in net fuel expense. Also, due to hedging contracts being locked in at a fixed rate on a portion of the fuel gallons we expect to use in 2018, we expect net fuel expense to decline in 2018 if fuel prices remain flat or increase. We do not currently have fuel hedging contracts for periods beyond 2018.\nAdditionally, $4.1 million, $16.7 million, and $15.3 million were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to our results from operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, as additional fuel expense for 2017, 2016 and 2015, related to losses on fuel hedge contracts that expired. We previously evaluated these contracts for \"hedge effectiveness,\" which is the extent to which the hedge contract effectively offsets changes in cash flows that the contract was intended to offset. At December 31, 2017, all fuel hedge contracts were deemed to be effective and thus continue to qualify as cash flow hedges. As a result of our early adoption of ASU 2017-12, we are no longer required to measure or record hedge ineffectiveness.\n\n\n\nOutlook\nAssets held for sale include property and revenue equipment no longer utilized in continuing operations which are available and held for sale. Assets held for sale are no longer subject to depreciation, and are recorded at the lower of depreciated book value or fair market value less selling costs. We periodically review the carrying value of these assets for possible impairment. We expect to sell these assets within twelve months.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility are classified as either \"base rate loans\" or \"LIBOR loans.\" Base rate loans accrue interest at a base rate equal to the greater of the Agent's prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, or LIBOR plus 1.0%, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.5% to 1.0%; while LIBOR loans accrue interest at LIBOR, plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.5% to 2.0%. The applicable rates are adjusted quarterly based on average pricing availability. The unused line fee is the product of 0.25% times the average daily amount by which the Lenders' aggregate revolving commitments under the Credit Facility exceed the outstanding principal amount of revolver loans and the aggregate undrawn amount of all outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility. The obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by us and secured by a pledge of substantially all of our assets, with the notable exclusion of any real estate or revenue equipment pledged under other financing agreements, including revenue equipment installment notes and capital leases.\nOur Truckload operating income was $1.7 million higher in 2017 than 2016 primarily as a result of a decrease in operating costs per mile, net of fuel surcharge revenue, due primarily to decreased net fuel expense, partially offset by increased purchased transportation expenses, depreciation and amortization expense, and operations and maintenance expense.\nWe have accounted for our investment in TEL using the equity method of accounting and thus our financial results include our proportionate share of TEL's net income. Given TEL's growth during the three years preceding 2015 and volatility in the used and leased equipment markets in which TEL operates, including the recent softening of the used tractor market, the impact on our earnings resulting from our investment and TEL's profitability was more moderate in 2017 and 2016 when compared to 2015, For the year ended December 31, 2017, our earnings resulting from our investment in TEL increased $0.4 million, primarily as a result of growth in TEL's lease offerings. We expect the impact on our earnings resulting from our investment in TEL to improve year-over-year, particularly if the used equipment market stabilizes or improves.\nOur financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, commodity contracts, accounts payable, debt, and interest rate swaps. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and current debt approximates their fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of the factored receivables approximates the fair value, as the receivables are generally repaid directly to us by the client's customer within 30-40 days due to the combination of the short-term nature of the financing transaction and the underlying quality of the receivables. Interest rates that are currently available to us for issuance of long-term debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate the fair value of our long-term debt, which primarily consists of revenue equipment installment notes. The fair value of our revenue equipment installment notes approximated the carrying value at December 31, 2017, as the weighted average interest rate on these notes approximates the market rate for similar debt. Borrowings under our revolving Credit Facility approximate fair value due to the variable interest rate on the facility. Additionally, commodity contracts, which are accounted for as hedge derivatives, as discussed in Note 13, are valued based on the forward rate of the specific indices upon which the contract is being settled and adjusted for counterparty credit risk using available market information and valuation methodologies. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements is determined using the market-standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed-cash payments and the discounted expected variable-cash receipts. The variable-cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. These analyses reflect the contractual terms of the swap, including the period to maturity, and use observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities. The fair value calculation also includes an amount for risk of non-performance of our counterparties using \"significant unobservable inputs\" such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default, which we have determined to be insignificant to the overall fair value of our interest rate swap agreements.\nOperating Ratio\nThe increase in Managed Freight revenue is primarily as a result of spot market opportunities related to the hurricane-affected regions during 2017 and growth with existing customers compared with the same 2016 periods.\nRESULTS OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS\nThe Credit Facility is a $95.0 million revolving credit facility, with an uncommitted accordion feature that, so long as no event of default exists, allows us to request an increase in the revolving credit facility of up to $50.0 million, subject to Lender acceptance of the additional funding commitment. The Credit Facility includes, within our $95.0 million revolving credit facility, a letter of credit sub facility in an aggregate amount of $95.0 million and a swing line sub facility in an aggregate amount equal to the greater of $10.0 million or 10% of the Lenders' aggregate commitments under the Credit Facility from time-to-time.\nSalaries, wages, and related expenses increased approximately $7.3 million, or 3.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 2016. As a percentage of total revenue, salaries, wages, and related expenses decreased to 34.3% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 35.0% in 2016. As a percentage of freight revenue, salaries, wages, and related expenses increased slightly to 38.6% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 38.4% in 2016. The change in salaries, wages, and related expenses is primarily due to pay adjustments for both driver and non-drivers since 2016 and an increase in non-driver incentive compensation. Additionally, fees paid to third party agents increased $1.1 million as a result of improved Managed Freight revenue and workers' compensation costs increased approximately 0.4 cents per mile as compared to the historic lows of 2016.\nAssets Held For Sale\nIn 2015 and 2016, we experienced marked surges in business and profitability during the fourth quarter holiday season, due to our team drivers and customer base. This occurred again in 2017, though not to the same extent as in the previous two years. After this surge, revenue generally decreases as customers reduce shipments following the holiday season and as inclement weather impedes operations. At the same time, operating expenses generally increase, with fuel efficiency declining because of engine idling and weather, creating more physical damage equipment repairs. For the reasons stated, first quarter results historically have been lower than results in each of the other three quarters of the year, excluding charges. The duration of what is considered peak season has shortened over the last few years and now is approximately a five-week period beginning the week of Thanksgiving and ending on Christmas Eve, and we have seen our customers' networks adjust accordingly. If this trend continues, our ability to take advantage of this surge in business and our fourth quarter profitability could be negatively affected.\nManaged Freight total revenue increased $1.1 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and operating income increased $1.9 million for the same period. These improvements are primarily the result of improved coordination with our Truckload segment, additional business from new customers added during the year, and the full year effect of a large customer added in 2015.\n\nINFLATION, NEW EMISSIONS CONTROL REGULATIONS, AND FUEL COSTS\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nIncome tax (benefit) expense fluctuated approximately $42.5 million, or 409.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 2016. As a percentage of total revenue, income tax (benefit) expense decreased to -4.6% of total revenue for 2017 from 1.5% in 2016. As a percentage of freight revenue, income tax (benefit) expense decreased to -5.1% of freight revenue for 2017 compared to 1.7% in 2016. These decreases were primarily related to the $40.1 million remeasurement of deferred taxes due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Additionally, primarily as a result of tax-planning strategies implemented during the fourth quarter of 2017, we were able to remove valuation allowances on certain state tax net operating losses providing for additional favorable impact of $1.2 million. These decreases were partially offset by the $3.9 million decrease in pre-tax income in 2017 compared to 2016, resulting from the declines in operating income noted above.\nDue to our significant self-insured retention amounts, we have exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims and to variations between our estimated and actual ultimate payouts. We accrue the estimated cost of the uninsured portion of pending claims and an estimate for allocated loss adjustment expenses including legal and other direct costs associated with a claim. Estimates require judgments concerning the nature and severity of the claim, historical trends, advice from third-party administrators and insurers, the size of any potential damage award based on factors such as the specific facts of individual cases, the jurisdictions involved, the prospect of punitive damages, future medical costs, and inflation estimates of future claims development, and the legal and other costs to settle or defend the claims. We have significant exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims. If there is an increase in the frequency and severity of claims, or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts if the claims prove to be more severe than originally assessed, or any of the claims would exceed the limits of our insurance coverage, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nMaterial Debt Agreements\nFuel expense\nAccounting Standards adopted\nAlthough a portion of our tractors are protected by non-binding indicative trade-in values or binding trade-back agreements with the manufacturers, some tractors and substantially all of our owned trailers continue to be subject to fluctuations in market prices for used revenue equipment. Moreover, our trade-back agreements are contingent upon reaching acceptable terms for the purchase of new equipment. Further declines in the price of used revenue equipment or failure to reach agreement for the purchase of new tractors with the manufacturers issuing trade-back agreements could result in impairment of, or losses on the sale of, revenue equipment. Historically, only a de minimis percentage of our equipment has been sold back to the dealers pursuant to the trade back agreements as we have generally found that market prices exceeded the trade back allowances, although in recent years, trade back allowances have increased as a result of the increasing cost of the underlying equipment.\n\nIf claims development factors that are based upon historical experience change by 10%, our claims accrual as of December 31, 2017, would change by approximately $0.8 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation decreased approximately $1.1 million, or 0.9%, compared with 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased to 17.5% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 16.4% in 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased to 19.2% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 18.5% in 2015. These changes were primarily the result of a $0.7 million increase in payments to third-party transportation providers related to increased revenues for our Managed Freight segment and growth of our temperature-controlled intermodal service offering. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in leased equipment rental payments due to a reduction in our trailers under operating leases from 2,239 at December 31, 2015 to 1,695 at December 31, 2016. We expect revenue equipment rentals to decrease going forward as a result of our increase in acquisition of revenue equipment through financed purchases or capital leases rather than operating leases. As discussed below, this decrease may be partially or fully offset by an increase in purchased transportation as we expect to continue to grow our Managed Freight segment.\nUnallocated corporate overhead increased primarily as a result of increased salaries and wages, including workers' compensation expense, compared to the historic lows for workers' compensation in 2016, as well as non-driver headcount increases since 2016 and increased non-driver incentive compensation. Non-driver headcount increased in 2017 due to strategic initiatives in information technology.\nEffective April 2015, we entered into new auto liability policies with a three-year term. The policy includes a limit for a single loss of $9.0 million, an aggregate of $18.0 million for each policy year, and a $30.0 million aggregate for the 42 month term ended March 31, 2018. The policy includes a policy release premium refund of up to $14.6 million, less any future amounts paid on claims by the insurer, from October 1, 2014 through March 31, 2018, if we were to commute the policy for the entire 42 months. A decision with respect to commutation of the policy cannot be made before April 1, 2018, unless both we and the insurance carrier agree to a commutation prior to the end of the policy term. Management cannot predict whether or not future claims or the development of existing claims will justify a commutation, and accordingly, no related amounts were recorded at December 31, 2017.\nDepreciation of Revenue Equipment\nAccounting Standards not yet adopted\nFor 2018, we are forecasting sequential operating income improvement throughout the year. We believe the combination of an improving economy, tightening truckload supply dynamics, industry regulatory changes including the ELD mandate and its enforcement, depleting inventories, year-over-year net fuel expense savings from our improved fuel hedge positions, and further operational progress at SRT should deliver increased pre-tax earnings for the full year of 2018. In addition, we expect earnings improvement from the estimated favorable effective tax rate impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. We are currently estimating our 2018 effective income tax rate to be in the range of 24.0% to 27.0%. We expect year-over-year average freight revenue per truck to be positive by a mid-to-high single digit percentage, inflecting more positively later in the year as a large portion of annual contractual rate revisions are implemented during the second quarter of 2018. Our expectation of positive year-over-year pretax income includes higher employee wages for each quarter of 2018 versus comparable 2017 quarters. We also expect a decline in the operating income of our non-asset based logistics service offering to partially offset the forecasted operating income improvement for our Truckload service offering. Within the non-asset based logistics service offering, we expect some margin deterioration resulting from higher purchased transportation expense, coupled with planned investments in strategic employees and a new transport management system designed to enhance our supply chain services and growth potential. From a balance sheet perspective, with net capital expenditures scheduled to be below normal due to the timing of our expected replacement cycle, along with anticipated positive operating cash flows, we expect to further reduce combined balance sheet and off-balance sheet debt over the course of fiscal 2018.\nSalaries, wages, and related expenses decreased approximately $10.3 million, or 4.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, salaries, wages, and related expenses increased to 35.0% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 33.8% in 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, salaries, wages, and related expenses increased slightly to 38.4% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 38.2% in 2015. Salaries, wages, and related expenses decreased significantly on an overall dollar basis as a result of a 3.9% decrease in average tractors, but were relatively flat as a percentage of freight revenue, primarily due to pay adjustments for both driver and non-drivers since 2015, partially offset by a decrease in non-driver incentive compensation as a result of reduced profitability in 2016 versus 2015. Additionally, group insurance costs decreased approximately $2.3 million from 2015 as a result of better claims experience.\nThe rate of fuel price changes also can have an impact on results. Most fuel surcharges are based on the average fuel price as published by the DOE for the week prior to the shipment, meaning we typically bill customers in the current week based on the previous week's applicable index. Therefore, in times of increasing fuel prices, we do not recover as much as we are currently paying for fuel. In periods of declining prices, the opposite is true. Fuel prices as measured by the DOE averaged approximately $0.35 cents per gallon higher in 2017 than 2016 and $0.40 cents per gallon lower in 2016 than 2015.\nOperations and maintenance increased $2.9 million, or 6.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 2016. As a percentage of total revenue, operations and maintenance remained relatively flat at 6.9% of total revenue in 2017, compared with 6.8% in 2016. As a percentage of freight revenue, operations and maintenance increased to 7.8% of freight revenue for 2017, from 7.5% in 2016, primarily due to extending the trade cycle of our tractors in the second half of 2016, as well as unloading and other operational costs associated with our increase in dedicated freight that was added since the first quarter of 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, depreciation and amortization increased $11.1 million, or 18.0%, compared with 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, depreciation and amortization increased to 10.8% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 8.5% for 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, depreciation and amortization increased to 11.9% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 9.6% in 2015. Depreciation, consisting primarily of depreciation of revenue equipment and excluding gains and losses, increased $9.6 million in 2016 from 2015, primarily as a result of more owned equipment and a significant reduction on the value of used tractors resulting in a change to residual values. Losses on the disposal of property and equipment totaled $0.8 million in 2016, as compared to gains of $0.6 million in 2015.\nWe have two reportable segments, truckload services, which we refer to as Truckload. In addition, our Managed Freight segment has service offerings ancillary to our Truckload services, including: freight brokerage and logistics service provided both directly and through freight brokerage agents, who are paid a commission for the freight they provide. These operations consist of several operating segments, which are aggregated due to similar margins and customers. Included within Managed Freight is also our accounts receivable factoring business, which does not meet the aggregation criteria but only accounts for $3.1 million of revenue. The operation of each of these businesses is described in our notes to Item 1 of Part 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOperating taxes and licenses\nPursuant to applicable accounting standards, revenue equipment and other long-lived assets are tested for impairment whenever an event occurs that indicates impairment may exist. Expected future cash flows are used to analyze whether an impairment has occurred. If the sum of expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the long-lived asset, then an impairment loss is recognized. We measure the impairment loss by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. Fair value is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis or the appraised value of the assets, as appropriate.\nOur Truckload operating income was $37.1 million less in 2016 than 2015 due to the abovementioned decrease in freight revenue. Additionally, operating costs per mile, net of fuel surcharge revenue, increased primarily due to increased salaries, wages, and related expenses (which was primarily due to a higher percentage of our fleet being comprised of team-driven tractors, as well as driver and non-driver employee pay increases since the same 2015 period), increased net fuel expense, and increased capital costs, partially offset by reduced workers' compensation expense and operations and maintenance expense.\nWe expect purchased transportation to increase as we seek to grow our Managed Freight segment. In addition, if fuel prices continue to increase, it would result in a further increase in what we pay third party carriers and owner operators. However, this expense category will fluctuate with the number and percentage of loads hauled by owner operators, loads handled by Managed Freight, and tractors, trailers, and other assets financed with operating leases. In addition, factors such as the cost to obtain third party transportation services, and growth of our intermodal service offerings, and the amount of fuel surcharge revenue passed through to the third party carriers and owner operators will affect this expense category. If industry-wide trucking capacity were to tighten in relation to freight demand, we may need to increase the amounts we pay to third-party transportation providers, owner operators, and intermodal transportation providers, which could increase this expense category on an absolute basis and as a percentage of freight revenue absent an offsetting increase in revenue. We continue to actively recruit owner operators and, if we are successful, we would expect this line item to increase as a percentage of revenue. Further, we exited the temperature-controlled intermodal business in the fourth quarter of 2017 in order to focus on our objective to continue improvements at SRT. As a result, we expect purchased transportation costs at SRT to decrease going forward, which could partially offset any increase in consolidated purchased transportation.\n\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nOur Truckload revenue increased $11.6 million, as fuel surcharge revenue increased $18.4 million, offset by a decrease in freight revenue of $6.8 million. The decrease in freight revenue relates to a $4.2 million decrease in freight revenue contributed by our temperature-controlled intermodal service offering, a decrease in our average tractor fleet of 1.4% from 2016, partially offset by an increase in average freight revenue per tractor per week of 0.9% compared to 2016. The increase in average freight revenue per tractor per week is the result of a 2.1% increase, or 3.6 cents per mile, in average rate per total mile, partially offset by a 1.4% decrease in average miles per unit when compared to 2016. Team driven units decreased approximately 11.6% to an average of 912 teams in 2017 from 1,032 teams in 2016.\nFor the periods presented, the change in interest expense, net was not significant as either a percentage of total revenue or freight revenue.\n\nOur business requires significant capital investments over the short-term and the long-term. Recently, we have financed our capital requirements with borrowings under our Credit Facility, cash flows from operations, long-term operating leases, capital leases, secured installment notes with finance companies, and proceeds from the sale of our used revenue equipment. Going forward, we expect revenue equipment acquisitions through purchases and capital leases to increase as a percentage of our fleet as we decrease our use of operating leases. We had working capital (total current assets less total current liabilities) of $81.1 million and $47.9 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our working capital on any particular day can vary significantly due to the timing of collections and cash disbursements. Based on our expected financial condition, net capital expenditures, results of operations, related net cash flows, installment notes, and other sources of financing, we believe our working capital and sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our current and projected needs and we do not expect to experience material liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future.\nCapital lease obligations are utilized to finance a portion of our revenue equipment and are entered into with certain finance companies who are not parties to our Credit Facility. The leases in effect at December 31, 2017 terminate in January 2018 through September 2023 and contain guarantees of the residual value of the related equipment by us. As such, the residual guarantees are included in the related debt balance as a balloon payment at the end of the related term as well as included in the future minimum capital lease payments. These lease agreements require us to pay personal property taxes, maintenance, and operating expenses.\nGoing forward, we believe salaries, wages, and related expenses will increase as a result of a tight driver market, wage inflation, higher healthcare costs, and, in certain periods, increased incentive compensation due to better performance. In particular, we expect driver pay to increase as we look to reduce the number of unseated tractors in our fleet in a tight market for drivers. Additionally, when the freight market allows for an increase in rates we would expect to, as we have historically, pass a portion of those rate increases on to our professional drivers. Salaries, wages, and related expenses will fluctuate to some extent based on the percentage of revenue generated by owner operators and our Managed Freight segment, for which payments are reflected in the purchased transportation line item.\nWe expect to continue managing our idle time and tractor speeds, investing in more fuel-efficient tractors to improve our miles per gallon, locking in fuel hedges when deemed appropriate, and partnering with customers to adjust fuel surcharge programs that are inadequate to recover a fair portion of fuel costs. Going forward, our net fuel expense is expected to fluctuate as a percentage of revenue based on factors such as diesel fuel prices, percentage recovered from fuel surcharge programs, percentage of uncompensated miles, percentage of revenue generated by team-driven tractors (which tend to generate higher miles and lower revenue per mile, thus proportionately more fuel cost as a percentage of revenue), percentage of revenue generated by refrigerated operation (which uses diesel fuel for refrigeration, but usually does not recover fuel surcharges on refrigeration fuel), percentage of revenue generated from owner operators, the success of fuel efficiency initiatives, and gains and losses on fuel hedging contracts.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, total fuel expense decreased approximately $19.1 million, or 15.6%, compared with 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, total fuel expense decreased to 15.4% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 16.9% in 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, total fuel expense decreased to 16.9% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 19.1% in 2015. These decreases primarily related to lower fuel prices and an increase in our average fuel miles per gallon during 2016 as a result of purchasing equipment with more fuel-efficient engines. The decreases were partially offset by increased net losses from fuel hedging transactions of $16.7 million in 2016 compared to $13.9 million in 2015.\nThe new standard will require us to recognize revenue from loads proportionally as the transportation service is performed as opposed to recognizing revenue upon the completion of the load, which is our current practice. Our recognition of revenue under the new standard will approximate our recognition of revenue under the current standards, as there will generally be a consistent amount of freight in process at the beginning and end of the period; however, seasonality and the day on which the period ends may cause minor differences. We plan to transition to the new standard by recognizing the cumulative effect of adoption as an adjustment in the first quarter of 2018. We believe the cumulative effect of the adoption will result in a positive adjustment to retained earnings of approximately $0.6 million, net of tax, from initially recording in process revenue and associated direct expenses. We plan to finalize our evaluation during the first quarter of 2018, including an assessment of the new expanded disclosure requirements and a final determination of the impact to adoption and related changes required to internal controls.\nGoing forward, our cash flows may fluctuate depending on capital expenditures, the resolution of the 2008 cargo claim, future stock repurchases, strategic investments or divestitures, and the extent of future income tax obligations and refunds.\nIncome from equity method investment\nPricing for the revenue equipment installment notes is quoted by the respective financial affiliates of our primary revenue equipment suppliers and other lenders at the funding of each group of equipment acquired and include fixed annual rates for new equipment under retail installment contracts. The notes included in the funding are due in monthly installments with final maturities at various dates ranging from January 2018 to July 2023. The notes contain certain requirements regarding payment, insuring of collateral, and other matters, but do not have any financial or other material covenants or events of default except certain notes totaling $120.8 million are cross-defaulted with the Credit Facility. Additionally, our fuel hedge contracts totaling $0.8 million at December 31, 2017, are cross-defaulted with the Credit Facility. Additional borrowings from the financial affiliates of our primary revenue equipment suppliers and other lenders are expected to be available to fund new tractors expected to be delivered in 2018, while any other property and equipment purchases, including trailers, are expected to be funded with a combination of available cash, notes, operating leases, capital leases, and/or from the Credit Facility.\nThe primary claims arising against us consist of auto liability (personal injury and property damage), workers' compensation, cargo, commercial liability, and employee medical expenses. Our insurance program involves self-insurance with the following risk retention levels (before giving effect to any commutation of an auto liability policy):\nOur Truckload revenue decreased $54.7 million, as freight revenue decreased $30.4 million and fuel surcharge revenue decreased $24.3 million. The decrease in freight revenue relates to a decrease in average freight revenue per tractor per week of 2.2% compared to 2015, partially offset by a $1.7 million increase in freight revenue contributed by our temperature-controlled intermodal service offering, as well as a decrease in our average tractor fleet of 3.9% from 2015. The decrease in average freight revenue per tractor per week is the result of a 1.3% decrease, or 2.2 cents per mile, in average rate per total mile and a 0.6% decrease in average miles per unit when compared to 2015. Additionally, team driven units increased approximately 5.3% to an average of approximately 1,000 teams in 2016 compared to approximately 950 in 2015.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We believe the future tax deductions will be realized principally through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income, except for when a valuation allowance has been provided.\nInsurance and claims increased approximately $0.7 million, or 2.2%, for year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, insurance and claims increased to 4.9% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 4.4% in 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, insurance and claims increased to 5.3% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 5.0% in 2015. These increases are primarily related to the $3.6 million benefit in the second quarter of 2015 from commutation of our auto liability policy for the period from April 1, 2013, through September 30, 2014. These increases also resulted from increased accident severity, resulting in total insurance cost increasing to 10.3 cents per mile for 2016 from 9.6 cents per mile in 2015. These increases were partially offset by decreased accident rates in 2016, as measured by a 6.8% improvement in DOT reportable accidents per million miles driven at 0.82% - the second lowest in the last ten years.\nIn the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions. We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management's evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense.\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities were $82.9 million in 2017 compared with $102.4 million in 2016 primarily due to the change in receivables and advances related to the timing of revenue and the related collections at the beginning of each period and the timing of cash collections on our other receivables in 2017 compared to 2016. These declines are partially offset by net income of $55.4 million in 2017 compared to net income of $16.8 million in 2016, of which approximately $40.1 million relates to the one-time remeasurement of deferred taxes due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The fluctuations in cash flows from accounts payable and accrued expenses primarily related to the timing of payments on our accrued expenses and trade accounts in the 2017 period compared to the 2016 period.\n\nInsurance and Other Claims\nFor comparison purposes in the discussion below, we use total revenue and freight revenue (total revenue less fuel surcharge revenue) when discussing changes as a percentage of revenue. As it relates to the comparison of expenses to freight revenue, we believe removing fuel surcharge revenue, which is sometimes a volatile source of revenue, affords a more consistent basis for comparing the results of operations from period-to-period. Nonetheless, freight revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not a substitute for revenue measured in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures. Our Board and management focus on our freight revenue as an indicator of our performance from period to period. We believe our presentation of freight revenue is useful because it provides investors and securities analysts the same information that we use internally to assess our core operating performance. Although we believe that freight revenue improves comparability in analyzing our period-to-period performance, it could limit comparability to other companies in our industry, if those companies define freight revenue differently. Because of these limitations, freight revenue should not be considered a measure of total revenue generated by or available to our business. Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures on a supplemental basis.\nRevenue Recognition\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation for book purposes is determined using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, while depreciation for tax purposes is generally recorded using an accelerated method. Depreciation of revenue equipment is our largest item of depreciation. We generally depreciate new tractors (excluding day cabs) over five years to salvage values of approximately 15% of their cost and new trailers over seven years for refrigerated trailers and ten years for dry van trailers to salvage values of approximately 25% of their cost. We annually review the reasonableness of our estimates regarding useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and other long-lived assets based upon, among other things, our experience with similar assets, conditions in the used revenue equipment market, and prevailing industry practice. Over the past several years, the price of new tractors has risen dramatically and there has been significant volatility in the used equipment market. As a result of the progressive decline in the market value of used tractors and our expectations that used tractor prices will not rebound in the near term, effective July 1, 2016 we reduced the salvage values on our tractors and, thus, prospectively increased depreciation expense. Estimates around the salvage values and useful lives for trailers remain unchanged. The impact from the third quarter of 2016 through 2017 was approximately $2.0 million per quarter of additional depreciation expense in subsequent quarters, or approximately $1.2 million per quarter net of tax, which represents approximately $0.06 per common or diluted share. We expect depreciation levels in 2018 to approximate those of 2017. Changes in the useful life or salvage value estimates, or fluctuations in market values that are not reflected in our estimates, could have a material effect on our results of operations. Gains and losses on the disposal of revenue equipment are included in depreciation expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nWe and substantially all of our subsidiaries (collectively, the \"Borrowers\") are parties to a Third Amended and Restated Credit Facility (the \"Credit Facility\") with Bank of America, N.A., as agent (the \"Agent\") and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\"JPM,\" and together with the Agent, the \"Lenders\").\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09. The new standard introduces a five-step model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The premise of the new model is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard will be effective for us for our annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Entities are allowed to transition to the new standard by either recasting prior periods or recognizing the cumulative effect.\nGeneral supplies and expenses\nAll such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Annual Report. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any change in the events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\n\nThe decrease in 2016 Truckload revenue relates to a decrease in average freight revenue per tractor per week of 2.2% compared to 2015 and a decrease in our average tractor fleet of 3.9% from 2015, partially offset by a $1.7 million increase in freight revenue contributed by our temperature-controlled intermodal service offering. The decrease in average freight revenue per tractor per week is the result of a 1.3% decrease, or 2.2 cents per mile, in average rate per total mile and a 0.6% decrease in average miles per unit when compared to 2015. Team driven units increased approximately 5.3% to an average of approximately 1,000 teams in 2016 from approximately 950 teams in 2015.\nWe also make judgments regarding the ultimate benefit versus risk of commuting certain periods within our auto liability policy. If we commute a policy, we assume 100% risk for covered claims in exchange for a policy refund. In April 2015, we commuted two liability policies for the period from April 1, 2013 through September 30, 2014, such that we are now responsible for any claim that occurred during that period up to $20.0 million, should such a claim develop. We recorded a $3.6 million reduction in insurance and claims expense in the second quarter of 2015 related to the commutation. The insurer did not remit the premium refund directly to the Company, but rather applied a credit to the current auto liability insurance policy, such that we recorded the policy release premium refund as a prepaid asset at June 30, 2015.\nGoing forward, we believe this category will fluctuate based on several factors, including our continued ability to maintain a relatively young fleet, accident severity and frequency, weather, and the reliability of new and untested revenue equipment models.\n\nIn August 2015, we financed a portion of the purchase of our corporate headquarters, a maintenance facility, and certain surrounding property in Chattanooga, Tennessee by entering into a $28.0 million variable rate note with a third party lender. Concurrently with entering into the note, we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively fix the related interest rate to 4.2%. See Note 13 for further information about the interest rate swap.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2016 to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nCash Flows\nLease Accounting and Off-Balance Sheet Transactions\nWe issue several types of stock-based compensation, including awards that vest based on service and performance conditions or a combination of the conditions. Performance-based awards vest contingent upon meeting certain performance criteria established by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. For performance-based awards, determining the appropriate amount to expense in each period is based on likelihood and timing of achieving the stated targets and requires judgment, including forecasting future financial results. The estimates are revised periodically based on the probability and timing of achieving the required performance targets and adjustments are made as appropriate. Awards that are only subject to time vesting provisions are amortized using the straight-line method.\nThis line item will fluctuate based on our decision with respect to purchasing revenue equipment with balance sheet debt versus operating leases as well as our ability to continue to generate profitable results and reduce our leverage.\nNet fuel expense increased $3.7 million, or 8.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, net fuel expense increased 0.9% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015. These increases primarily resulted from lower fuel surcharge recovery as a result of increased broker freight and the tiered reimbursement structure of certain fuel surcharge agreements. The increases were partially offset by improved miles per gallon due to new engine technology, internal fuel efficiency initiatives, and a greater percentage of miles driven by owner operators, where we pay a rate that reflects then-existing fuel prices and we do not have the natural hedge created by fuel surcharge.\nThe following table sets forth total revenue and freight revenue (total revenue less fuel surcharge revenue) for the periods indicated:\nWith an average tractor fleet age of 2.1 years, we believe we have flexibility to manage our fleet and we plan to regularly evaluate our tractor replacement cycle, new tractor purchase requirements, and financing options.\nThe increase in Managed Freight revenue is primarily the result of improved coordination with our Truckload segment, additional business from new customers added during the year, and the full year effect of a large customer added in 2015.\nOperating taxes and licenses decreased approximately $1.8 million, or 15.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 2016. As a percentage of total revenue, operating taxes and licenses decreased to 1.4% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 1.7% in 2016. As a percentage of freight revenue, operating taxes and licenses decreased to 1.6% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 1.9% in 2016. The decrease in operating taxes and licenses, including as a percentage of total revenue and freight revenue, is primarily due to the settlement of a property tax matter that resulted in a decrease of a prior year's assessment and related refund, as well as a lower truck count.\nIn 2017 and 2016 we had net losses on revenue equipment of $4.0 million and $0.8 million, respectively, and in 2015 we generated net gains on revenue equipment, including assets held for sale, of $0.6 million. We review salvage values of our revenue equipment annually and make adjustments periodically, based on trends in the used equipment market, to reflect updated estimates of fair value at disposal.\nIn addition to estimates within our self-insured retention layers, we also must make judgments concerning claims where we have third party insurance and for claims outside our coverage limits. Upon settling claims and expenses associated with claims where we have third party coverage, we are generally required to initially fund payment to the claimant and seek reimbursement from the insurer. Receivables from insurers for claims and expenses we have paid on behalf of insurers were $1.1 million and $0.7 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and are included in drivers' advances and other receivables on our consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, we accrue claims above our self-insured retention and record a corresponding receivable for amounts we expect to collect from insurers upon settlement of such claims. We have $2.1 million and less than $0.1 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as a receivable in other assets and as a corresponding accrual in the long-term portion of insurance and claims accruals on our consolidated balance sheet for claims above our self-insured retention for which we believe it is reasonably assured that the insurers will provide their portion of such claims. We evaluate collectability of the receivables based on the credit worthiness and surplus of the insurers, along with our prior experience and contractual terms with each. If any claim occurrence were to exceed our aggregate coverage limits, we would have to accrue for the excess amount. Our critical estimates include evaluating whether a claim may exceed such limits and, if so, by how much. If one or more claims were to exceed our then effective coverage limits, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2017 to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRevenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased approximately $24.5 million, or 20.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 2016. As a percentage of total revenue, revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased to 20.1% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 17.5% in 2016. As a percentage of freight revenue, revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased to 22.6% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 19.2% in 2016. These changes were primarily the result of a $19.8 million increase in payments to third-party transportation providers primarily related to increased revenues for our Managed Freight segment and the increased need for outside capacity to meet the demands of peak season for our Truckload services. Additionally, the percentage of the total miles run by owner-operators increased from 9.7% for 2016 to 10.3% for 2017. These increases were partially offset by reduced expenses resulting from a reduction and subsequent elimination of our temperature-controlled intermodal service offering.\nSEASONALITY\nIn addition to operating ratio, we use \"adjusted operating ratio\" as a key measure of profitability. Adjusted operating ratio means operating expenses, net of fuel surcharge revenue, expressed as a percentage of revenue, excluding fuel surcharge revenue. Adjusted operating ratio is not a substitute for operating ratio measured in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the use of adjusted operating ratio allows us to more effectively compare periods, while excluding the potentially volatile effect of changes in fuel prices. Our Board and management focus on our adjusted operating ratio as an indicator of our performance from period to period. We believe our presentation of adjusted operating ratio is useful because it provides investors and securities analysts the same information that we use internally to assess our core operating performance. Although we believe that adjusted operating ratio improves comparability in analyzing our period-to-period performance, it could limit comparability to other companies in our industry, if those companies define adjusted operating ratio differently. Because of these limitations, adjusted operating ratio should not be considered a measure of income generated by our business or discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures on a supplemental basis.\nNet fuel expense decreased $16.6 million, or 33.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. As a percentage of freight revenue, net fuel expense decreased 2.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. These decreases primarily resulted from higher fuel surcharge recovery as a result of decreased broker freight and the tiered reimbursement structure of certain fuel surcharge agreements. The decreases were partially offset by a greater percentage of miles driven by owner operators, where we pay a rate that reflects then-existing fuel prices and we do not have the natural hedge created by fuel surcharge.\nFor the 2016 year compared to 2015, the change in operating taxes and licenses was not significant as either a percentage of total revenue or freight revenue.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, operations and maintenance decreased $0.6 million, or 1.3%, compared with 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, operations and maintenance remained relatively flat at 6.8% of total revenue in 2016, compared with 6.4% in 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, operations and maintenance increased to 7.5% of freight revenue for 2016, from 7.3% in 2015 due to an increase in unloading and other operational costs associated with our increase in dedicated freight, partially offset by lower maintenance cost on our revenue equipment.\nItem 7, as well as other items of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, contains certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and such statements are subject to the safe harbor created by those sections and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical or current fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including without limitation: any projections of earnings, revenues, or other financial items; any statement of plans, strategies, and objectives of management for future operations; any statements concerning proposed new services or developments; any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance; any statements of belief; and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. In this Item 7, statements relating to future demand for and supply of new and used tractors and trailers (including expected prices of such equipment), expected sources and adequacy of working capital and liquidity, future relationships, use, compensation, and availability with respect to third-party service providers, future driver market conditions, future allocation of capital, expected settlement of operating lease obligations, future asset sales and acquisitions, future insurance, litigation, and claims levels and expenses, future tax rates, expense, and deductions, future fuel management, expense, and the future effectiveness of fuel surcharge programs and price hedges, future interest rates and effectiveness of interest rate swaps, expected capital expenditures (including the future mix of lease and purchase obligations), future trucking capacity, expected freight demand and volumes, future rates, future depreciation and amortization, future compliance with and impact of existing and proposed federal and state laws and regulations, future salaries, wages, and other employee benefit expenses, future earnings from and value of our investments, future customer relationships, future defaults under debt agreements, future payment of financing and lease liabilities, future performance of our subsidiaries, future credit availability, including expected borrowing base increases in our credit facility, expected transition to and effect of new accounting standards, expected effect of remeasured deferred tax assets, and future operating and maintenance expenses, among others, are forward-looking statements.

Readers should review and consider the factors discussed in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors,\" along with various disclosures in our press releases, stockholder reports, and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nUnallocated corporate overhead remained relatively flat as a result of a $3.2 million reduction in incentive compensation in 2016, primarily as a result of decreased profitability, partially offset by the 2015 period including the $3.6 million in return of previously expensed insurance premiums for the commutation of our primary auto liability policy for the period of April 1, 2013, through September 30, 2014.\nNet cash flows used by investing activities were $62.1 million in 2017 compared with $47.3 million in 2016. The $14.8 million increase in net investing activities was attributable primarily to a $16.8 million decrease in proceeds from dispositions of used revenue equipment which primarily resulted from the timing and dispositions of assets held for sale as well as our decision to extend the trade cycle of our current equipment. During 2018 we plan to take delivery of approximately 510 new company tractors and dispose of approximately 500 used tractors. This compares to the approximately 635 new company tractors we took delivery of and the approximately 615 used tractors we disposed of during 2017. Going forward, cash flows from disposals of equipment could be more volatile given the weakness in the used tractor market.\nInsurance and claims, consisting primarily of premiums and deductible amounts for liability, physical damage, and cargo damage insurance and claims, increased approximately $0.6 million, or 1.7%, for year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 2016. As a percentage of total revenue, insurance and claims decreased to 4.7% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 4.9% in 2016. As a percentage of freight revenue, insurance and claims remained flat at 5.3% of freight revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The change in total revenue resulted from increased accident severity early in 2017, partially offset by an 8.2% improvement in DOT reportable accidents per million miles driven for the 2017 year. Total insurance cost increased to 10.7 cents per mile for 2017 from 10.3 cents per mile in 2016.\n \u25cf Total revenue was $705.0 million, compared with $670.7 million for 2016, and freight revenue (which excludes revenue from fuel surcharges) was $626.8 million, compared with $610.8 million for 2016; \u25cf Operating income was $28.1 million, compared with operating income of $32.4 million for 2016; \u25cf Net income was $55.4 million, or $3.02 per diluted share, compared with net income of $16.8 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, for 2016; \u25cf Our equity investment in TEL provided $3.4 million of pre-tax earnings in 2017, compared to $3.0 million for 2016; and \u25cf Stockholders' equity and tangible book value at December 31, 2017, were $295.2 million, or $16.11 per basic share. \n\"Unallocated Corporate Overhead\" includes costs that are incidental to our activities and are not specifically allocated to one of the segments. The following table summarizes financial and operating data by segment:\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nFor the periods presented, the changes in communications and utilities were not significant as either a percentage of total revenue or freight revenue.\n\nStock-Based Employee Compensation\nWe receive a fuel surcharge on our loaded miles from most shippers; however, this does not cover the entire increase in fuel prices for several reasons, including the following: surcharges cover only loaded miles we operate; surcharges do not cover miles driven out-of-route by our drivers; and surcharges typically do not cover refrigeration unit fuel usage or fuel burned by tractors while idling. Moreover, most of our business relating to shipments obtained from freight brokers does not carry a fuel surcharge. Finally, fuel surcharges vary in the percentage of reimbursement offered, and not all surcharges fully compensate for fuel price increases even on loaded miles.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility are subject to a borrowing base limited to the lesser of (A) $95.0 million, minus the sum of the stated amount of all outstanding letters of credit; or (B) the sum of (i) 85% of eligible accounts receivable, plus (ii) the lesser of (a) 85% of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible revenue equipment, (b) 95% of the net book value of eligible revenue equipment, or (c) 35% of the Lenders' aggregate revolving commitments under the Credit Facility, plus (iii) the lesser of (a) $25.0 million or (b) 65% of the appraised fair market value of eligible real estate, as reduced by a periodic amortization amount. We had $9.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2017, undrawn letters of credit outstanding of approximately $32.9 million, and available borrowing capacity of $53.1 million. The interest rate on outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2017, was 5.0% on less than $0.1 million of base rate loans and 3.1% on $9.0 million of LIBOR loans. Based on availability as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, there was no fixed charge coverage requirement.\nTotal fuel expense remained flat for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 2016. As a percentage of total revenue, total fuel expense decreased to 14.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 15.4% in 2016. As a percentage of freight revenue, total fuel expense decreased to 16.5% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 16.9% in 2016. These increases primarily related to higher fuel prices in 2017, offset by net losses from fuel hedging transactions of $4.1 million in 2017 compared to $16.7 million in 2016.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nThe following table sets forth our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2017:\nRevenue, drivers' wages, and other direct operating expenses generated by our Truckload reportable segment are recognized on the date shipments are delivered to the customer. Revenue includes transportation revenue, fuel surcharges, loading and unloading activities, equipment detention, and other accessorial services.\nFor 2017, total revenue increased $34.4 million, or 5.1%, to $705.0 million from $670.7 million in 2016. Freight revenue increased $16.0 million, or 2.6%, to $626.8 million for 2017, from $610.8 million in 2016, while fuel surcharge revenue increased $18.4 million year-over-year. The increase in freight revenue resulted from a $22.8 million increase in revenues from Managed Freight, partially offset by a $6.8 million decrease in freight revenue from our Truckload segment.\nWe issue residual value guarantees in connection with the operating leases we enter into for certain of our revenue equipment. These leases provide that if we do not purchase the leased equipment from the lessor at the end of the lease term, then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the equipment and an agreed value. To the extent the expected value at the lease termination date is lower than the residual value guarantee, we would accrue for the difference over the remaining lease term. We believe that proceeds from the sale of equipment under operating leases would equal or exceed the payment obligation on substantially all operating leases. The estimated values at lease termination involve management judgments. As leases are entered into, determination as to the classification as an operating or capital lease involves management judgments on residual values and useful lives.\nCommunications and utilities\n\nWe periodically utilize derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in fuel prices and interest rates. At inception of a derivative contract, we document relationships between derivative instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various derivative transactions, and assess hedge effectiveness. We record derivative financial instruments in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability at fair value. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. The changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nOur auto liability (personal injury and property damage), cargo, and general liability insurance programs include significant self-insured retention amounts. The auto liability policy contains a feature whereby we are able to retroactively obtain a partial refund of the premium in exchange for taking on the liability for incidents that occurred during the period and releasing the insurers. This is referred to as \"commuting\" the policy or \"policy commutation.\" In several past periods, including the policy period from April 1, 2013, through September 30, 2014, commuted in 2015, we have commuted the policy, which has lowered our insurance and claims expense. We are also self-insured for physical damage to our equipment. Because of these significant self-insured exposures, insurance and claims expense may fluctuate significantly from period-to-period. Any increase in frequency or severity of claims, or any increases to then-existing reserves, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We have accrued a reserve in connection with a judgment that was rendered against us based on a 2008 cargo claim. We recorded an additional $0.9 million of expense in the first quarter of 2017 in order to accrue additional legal fees and pre-judgment interest since the time of our previous appeal. We are currently pursuing a second appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals related to the District Court's decision on damages. If these further proceedings are resolved favorably to us, any reduction of the accrual could reduce insurance and claims expense in the period in which the claim is resolved. On the other hand, if the proceedings are not resolved favorably, insurance and claims expense may increase as a result of continuing litigation expenses, including pre and post judgment interest. We periodically evaluate strategies to efficiently reduce our insurance and claims expense, which in the past have included the commutation of our auto liability insurance policy. We intend to evaluate our ability to commute the current policy and any such commutation could significantly impact insurance and claims expense.\nRevenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make decisions based upon estimates, assumptions, and factors we consider as relevant to the circumstances. Such decisions include the selection of applicable accounting principles and the use of judgment in their application, the results of which impact reported amounts and disclosures. Changes in future economic conditions or other business circumstances may affect the outcomes of our estimates and assumptions. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those anticipated. A summary of the significant accounting policies followed in preparation of the financial statements is contained in Note 1, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" of the consolidated financial statements attached hereto. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates.\nDepreciation and amortization consists primarily of depreciation of tractors, trailers and other capital assets offset or increased, as applicable, by gains or losses on dispositions of capital assets. Depreciation and amortization in 2017 increased $4.0 million, or 5.5%, compared with 2016. As a percentage of total revenue, depreciation and amortization remained flat at 10.8% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. As a percentage of freight revenue, depreciation and amortization increased to 12.2% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 11.9% in 2016. Depreciation, consisting primarily of depreciation of revenue equipment and excluding gains and losses, increased $0.8 million in 2017 from 2016, primarily as a result of the full year effect of the decreased salvage values implemented in 2016. Additionally, the soft used truck market contributed to losses on the sale of property and equipment of $4.0 million in 2017 compared to losses of $0.8 million in 2016.\nIn February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which requires lessees to recognize a right-to-use asset and a lease obligation for all leases. Lessees are permitted to make an accounting policy election to not recognize an asset and liability for leases with a term of twelve months or less. Lessor accounting under the new standard is substantially unchanged. Additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures, including significant judgments made by management, will be required. This new standard will become effective for us in our annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period and requires a modified retrospective transition approach. We are currently evaluating the impacts the adoption of this standard will have on the consolidated financial statements.\nInterest expense, net\nNet cash flows used in financing activities were $13.2 million in 2017 compared to $51.9 million in 2016, primarily as a function of net repayments, in 2016, of notes payable facilitated by cash flows primarily related to the trade cycle of our revenue equipment. In particular, this decrease reflects the sale of the previously noted 615 tractors in the 2017 compared to 1,074 tractors in 2016.\nFor 2016, total revenue decreased $53.6 million, or 7.4%, to $670.7 million from $724.2 million in 2015. Freight revenue decreased $29.3 million, or 4.6%, to $610.8 million for 2016, from $640.1 million in 2015, while fuel surcharge revenue decreased $24.3 million year-over-year. The decrease in freight revenue resulted from a $30.4 million decrease in freight revenue from our Truckload segment, partially offset by a $1.1 million increase in revenues from Managed Freight.\nOperations and maintenance\nOperating leases are an important source of financing for our revenue equipment and certain real estate. At December 31, 2017, we had financed 234 tractors and 967 trailers under operating leases. Vehicles held under operating leases are not carried on our consolidated balance sheets, and lease payments, in respect of such vehicles, are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations in the line item \"Revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation.\" Our revenue equipment rental expense was $12.1 million in 2017, compared with $10.6 million in 2016. The total value of remaining payments under operating leases as of December 31, 2017, was approximately $18.6 million. In connection with various operating leases, we issued residual value guarantees, which provide that if we do not purchase the leased equipment from the lessor at the end of the lease term, we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the equipment and an agreed value. The residual guarantees expire between August 2018 and February 2019 and had an undiscounted value of approximately $4.0 million at December 31, 2017. The discounted present value of the total remaining lease payments and residual value guarantees were approximately $21.7 million at December 31, 2017. We expect our residual guarantees to approximate the market value at the end of the lease term. We believe that proceeds from the sale of equipment under operating leases would equal or exceed the payment obligation on substantially all operating leases.\nWe expect depreciation and amortization to stabilize as the impact of the significant 2016 reductions in residual values will flatten on a comparative basis going forward. Additionally, if the used tractor market were to decline further, we could have to adjust residual values again and increase depreciation or experience increased losses on sale.\nWe are encouraged by our continued profitability and we continue to focus on our turnaround efforts at SRT, which realized a more than a 400 basis point improvement in its operating margin compared to 2016. We are also continuing to deleverage our balance sheet, resulting in total indebtedness, net of cash and including the present value of off-balance sheet lease obligations, decreasing approximately $6.6 million since December 31, 2016. Additionally, earnings included the approximately $40.1 million favorable effective tax rate impact from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and the reduced negative impact of the fuel hedges have increased tangible book value per basic share 24.4% to $16.11 from $12.95 at December 31, 2016.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRevenue generated by our Managed Freight segment is recognized upon completion of the services provided. Revenue is recorded on a gross basis, without deducting third party purchased transportation costs, as we act as a principal with substantial risks as primary obligor, except for transactions whereby equipment from our Truckload segment perform the related services, which we record on a net basis in accordance with the related authoritative guidance. Managed Freight revenue includes $3.1 million, $2.6 million, and $2.4 million of revenue in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, related to an accounts receivable factoring business. Revenue for this business is recognized on a net basis, given we are acting as an agent and are not the primary obligor in these transactions.", "item_7_tables": "Table 40: <table> <tr> <td> </td>
