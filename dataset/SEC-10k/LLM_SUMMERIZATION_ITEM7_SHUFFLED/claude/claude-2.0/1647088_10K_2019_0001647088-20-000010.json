Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help the reader understand WillScot, our operations and our present business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto, contained in Item 8 of this report. As a result of the Business Combination, (i) WillScot's consolidated financial results for periods prior to November 29, 2017 reflect the financial results of WSII and its consolidated subsidiaries, as the accounting predecessor to WillScot, and (ii) for periods from and after this date, WillScot's financial results reflect those of WillScot and its consolidated subsidiaries (including WSII and its subsidiaries) as the successor following the Business Combination. We use certain non-GAAP financial information that we believe is important for purposes of comparison to prior periods and development of future projections and earnings growth prospects. This information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are provided where presented.\nExecutive Summary\nWe are a leading provider of modular space and portable storage solutions in the US, Canada and Mexico. As of December 31, 2019, our branch network included approximately 120 locations and additional drop lots to better service our more than 50,000 customers across the US, Canada, and Mexico. We offer our customers an extensive selection of ready to work\u201d modular space and portable storage solutions with over 125,000 modular space units and over 25,000 portable storage units in our fleet. We remain focused on our core priorities of growing modular leasing revenues by increasing modular space units on rent, both organically and through our consolidation strategy, delivering Ready to Work\u201d solutions to our customers with VAPS and on continually improving the overall customer experience.\n2019 was a transformational year for WillScot as we completed our integration of ModSpace and realized significant cost synergies from both the ModSpace and Acton strategic transactions. Over the past two years, we have consolidated over 200 combined operating locations into approximately 120 operating locations. We will continue the last remaining integration efforts around real estate consolidation and fleet relocation over the first half of 2020. These acquisitions coupled with WillScot's innovative \"Ready to Work\" solutions and commitment to customer service have solidified WillScot's position as the industry market leader in the modular space and portable storage solutions markets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, key drivers of financial performance included:\n\u2022Total revenues increased by $312.3 million, or 41.6% as compared to the same period in 2018, driven by a 43.3% increase in our core leasing and services revenues from both organic pricing growth, and the impact of an additional 8.5 months of contribution from the ModSpace acquisition during 2019 (discussed in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements). New and rental unit sales increased 10.3% and 61.2%, respectively, also driven by acquisitions.\n-Consolidated modular space average monthly rental rate increased to $614 representing an 11.2% increase year over year.\n-Consolidated average modular space units on rent increased 21,425, or 30.5%, year over year, driven by an additional 8.5 months of contribution from the ModSpace acquisition, and average modular space utilization increased 40 basis points ( bps\u201d) year over year to 72.0%.\n\u2022On a pro forma basis, including results of WillScot and ModSpace for all periods presented:\n-Modular leasing revenues increased $53.4 million, or 7.7%, driven by a 13.7% year over year increase in modular space average monthly rental rates as a result of our price optimization tools and processes, as well as by continued growth in our Ready to Work\u201d solutions and increased VAPS penetration across our customer base.\n-Sales revenue declined $46.9 million, or 32.1%, driven primarily by one large new sale recognized in 2018 from ModSpace related to hurricane relief in the amount of $29.0 million in our Modular - US segment.\n-Total revenues decreased $0.4 million, as the impact of non-recurring sales in the prior year were nearly offset by continued strong organic growth in our core leasing revenues.\n-Modular space units on rent decreased 4.3% year over year, and utilization increased 30 bps.\n\u2022Modular - US segment revenues, which represented 90.4% of revenues in 2019, increased by $284.1 million, or 41.9%, as compared to 2018, through:\n-Modular space average monthly rental rate of $617 increased 12.0% year over year including the dilutive impacts of acquisitions. Improved pricing was driven by a combination of our price optimization tools and processes, as well as by continued growth in our \"Ready to Work\" solutions and increased VAPS penetration across our customer base.\n-Average modular space units on rent increased by 19,373 units, or 30.6%, due to the impact of an additional 8.5 months of contribution from the ModSpace acquisition.\n-Average modular space monthly utilization increased 50 basis points ( bps\u201d) to 74.2% in 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018. This increase was driven primarily by de-fleeting activities associated with our integration efforts during year.\n-On a pro forma basis, including results of WillScot and ModSpace for all periods presented, average modular space monthly rental rate increased 14.9% organically, with average modular space units on rent down 4.5% and average modular space monthly utilization up by 40 basis points ( bps\u201d) during the year to 74.2%.\n\u2022Modular - Other North America segment which represents 9.6% of revenues in 2019, increased by $28.1 million, or 38.1% as compared to the same period in 2018. Increases were driven primarily by:\n-Average modular space monthly rental rate increased 5.5% to $590.\n-Average modular space units on rent increased by 2,052 units, or 29.6%, as compared to the same period in 2018 driven primarily by acquired units from the ModSpace transaction.\n-Average modular space monthly utilization decreased by 70 bps to 56.1% in 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018.\n-On a pro forma basis, including results of WillScot and ModSpace for all periods presented, Modular - Other North America segment modular space monthly rental rate increased 4.4%, with modular space units on rent down 2.5%, and average modular space monthly utilization down by 30 bps during the year to 56.1%.\n\u2022Generated consolidated net loss of $11.5 million, which included an $8.8 million loss on extinguishment of debt and $46.0 million of discrete costs expensed in the period related to the ModSpace integration and other acquisition-related activities, including $26.6 million of integration costs, $11.5 million of impairment of long-lived assets and lease impairment expense and other related charges, $3.8 million of restructuring cost, and $4.1 of other expense. The consolidated net loss of $11.5 million represented an improvement of $42.1 million as compared to the same period in 2018.\n\u2022Generated Adjusted EBITDA of $356.5 million in 2019, representing an increase of $141.0 million or 65.4% as compared to the same period in 2018, which includes the impact of an additional 8.5 months of contribution from the ModSpace acquisition in 2019, as well as continued realization of commercial and cost synergies associated with the ModSpace and Acton acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA for the Modular - US segment and the Modular - Other North America segment, respectively, was $325.0 million and $31.5 million in 2019.\n\u2022On a pro forma basis, including the results of WillScot and ModSpace for all periods presented, Adjusted EBITDA in 2019 of $356.5 million represents an increase of $72.0 million, or 25.3% organically from $284.5 million in 2018. These pro forma results include realized cost savings from the ModSpace and Acton acquisitions, and incremental revenue growth from increased penetration of \"Ready to Work\" solutions across the combined portfolio, but do not include any additional cost savings that management expects to realize in future years.\n\u2022Generated Free Cash Flow of $20.0 million in 2019, as net cash provided by operating activities of $172.6 million after funding $26.6 million of integration costs was reinvested primarily in value added products and fleet refurbishments to support growth of modular leasing revenues (net cash used in investing activities of $152.6 million) and to pay down debt $16.5 million.\nIn addition to focusing on GAAP measurements, we focus on Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow to measure our operating results. As such, we include in this Annual Report on Form 10-K reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations and descriptions of why we believe these measures provide useful information to investors as well as a description of the limitations of these measures are included in Item 6. Selected Financial Data.\u201d\nRecent Developments\nRefer to the Recent Developments section in Part I, Item 1, Business, herein for further information about our recent warrant redemption and merger agreement.\nBusiness Environment and Outlook\nOur customers operate in a diversified set of end markets, including commercial and industrial, construction, education, energy and natural resources, government and other end markets. We track several market leading indicators including those related to our two largest end markets, the commercial and industrial segment and the construction segment, which collectively accounted for approximately 80% of our revenues in the year ended December 31, 2019. Market fundamentals underlying these markets are currently stable, and we expect continued modest market growth in the next several years. Current conditions, and potential growth drivers such as a robust U.S. economy, increased infrastructure spending, and continued penetration of our customer base with our VAPS offering provide us confidence in continued demand for our products.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, 9.6% of our revenues were from the Modular - Other North America segment, markets in Canada, including Alaska, and Mexico. Revenues from this segment had declined since 2014 as a result of exposure to upstream oil and gas end markets in Alberta, Canada and Alaska. While average modular space units on rent and rental rates have stabilized, competitive pressures in these markets may continue to impact performance until utilization across the industry improves.\nOur Business and Growth Strategies\nWe intend to maintain a leading market position and increase our revenue and profitability by pursuing the following strategies:\nExpanding our Ready to Work\u201d Value Proposition.\nWe combine product quality and availability, the largest service network in North America, an industry-leading offering of VAPS and a commitment to customer service to provide increased value to our customers. This attracts new customers, increases customer retention and increases our margins. We intend to grow the business by continuing to improve the quality, delivery and service of our products and by continuing to introduce new and innovative products and services that complement our core offering to the most attractive industry and geographic end markets.\nIncreasing the Utilization and Yield of our Rental Equipment.\nWe are continuously working to increase the utilization and yield of our lease fleet by improving the efficiency and performance of our sales force, expanding penetration of VAPS and enhancing our management information systems. Effective use of real-time information allows us to monitor and optimize the utilization of our fleet, allocate our fleet to the highest demand markets, optimize pricing and determine the best allocation of our capital to invest in fleet and branches as well as to identify opportunities where underutilized lease fleet can be sold to generate cash.\nOptimizing Cash Flow through Strategic Deployment of Capital.\nWe maintain a disciplined focus on our return on capital. As part of this discipline, we diligently consider the potential returns and opportunity costs associated with each investment we make. We continually assess both our existing lease fleet and customer demand for opportunities to deploy capital more efficiently. We manage our maintenance capital expenditures as well as growth capital expenditures to best fit the economic conditions at the time. Within our existing lease fleet, we examine the potential cash and earnings generation of an asset sale versus continuing to lease the asset. In addition, we examine the relative benefits of organic expansion opportunities versus expansion through acquisition to obtain a favorable return on capital.\nGenerating Additional Cash Flow Through Operational Efficiencies and Cost Reductions.\nWe have implemented a number of management initiatives designed to improve operations and increase profitability, efficiency and operating leverage. We continually assess our branch operating footprint, our vendor base, and our operating structure to maximize revenue generation while minimizing costs. The acquisitions of Acton and ModSpace provided us with increased scale that allowed us to reduce from over 200 combined operating locations to approximately 120 operating locations by the end of 2019. With this post-acquisition scale, we expect to extract over $60.0 million of redundant costs from the combined businesses. As of December 31, 2019, we estimate that we have realized over $40 million of cumulative savings related to the Acton and ModSpace acquisitions and subsequent integrations. We have a proven track record of efficiently integrating acquisitions and quickly eliminating operational redundancies, while maintaining acquired customer relationships.\nLeveraging Scale via Acquisitions.\nThe US market for modular space and portable storage solutions is fragmented, with approximately 60% of the modular space market supplied by regional and local competitors. We have a broad network of operating branches in North\nAmerica, as well as a highly scalable corporate center and management information systems, which we believe positions us well to continue to acquire and integrate other companies. We may pursue acquisitions that will provide further scale efficiencies to our platform, allowing us to improve returns generated by the acquired assets.\nComponents of Our Consolidated Historical Results of Operations\nRevenue\nOur revenue consists mainly of leasing, services and sales revenue. We derive our leasing and services revenue primarily from the leasing of modular space and portable storage units. Included in modular leasing revenue are VAPS, such as rentals of steps, ramps, furniture, air conditioners, wireless internet access points, damage waivers and service plans. Modular delivery and installation revenue includes fees that we charge for the delivery, setup, knockdown and pick-up of leasing equipment to and from customers' premises and repositioning leasing equipment.\nThe key drivers of changes in our leasing revenue are:\n\u2022the number of units in our modular lease fleet;\n\u2022the average utilization rate of our modular lease units; and\n\u2022the average monthly rental rate per unit, including VAPS.\nThe average utilization rate of our modular lease units is the ratio of (i) the average number of units in use during a period (which includes units from the time they are leased to a customer until the time they are returned to us) to (ii) the average total number of units available for lease in our modular fleet during a period. Our average monthly rental rate per unit for a period is equal to the ratio of (i) our rental income for that period including VAPS but excluding delivery and installation services, to (ii) the average number of modular lease units rented to our customers during that period.\nThe table below sets forth the average number of units on rent in our modular lease fleet, the average utilization of our modular lease units, and the average monthly rental rate per unit, including VAPS:\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands, except unit numbers and rates) </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Modular space units on rent (average during the period) </td> <td>91,682 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,263 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average modular space utilization rate </td> <td>72.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>71.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>70.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average modular space monthly rental rate </td> <td>$ </td> <td>614 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>552 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>538 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Portable storage units on rent (average during the period) </td> <td>16,878 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,480 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,599 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average portable storage utilization rate </td> <td>65.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>68.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>71.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average portable storage monthly rental rate </td> <td>$ </td> <td>120 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>119 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>116 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to leasing revenue, we also generate revenue from sales of new and used modular space and portable storage units to our customers, as well as delivery, installation, maintenance, removal services and other incidental items related to accommodations services for our customers. Included in our sales revenue are charges for modifying or customizing sales equipment to customers' specifications.\nGross Profit\nWe define gross profit as the difference between total revenue and cost of revenue. Cost of revenues associated with our leasing business includes payroll and payroll-related costs for branch personnel, material and other costs related to the repair, maintenance, storage and transportation of rental equipment. Cost of revenue also includes depreciation expense associated with our rental equipment. Cost of revenues associated with our new unit sales business includes the cost to purchase, assemble, transport and customize units that are sold. Cost of revenues for our rental unit sales consist primarily of the net book value of the unit at date of sale.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nOur selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expense includes all costs associated with our selling efforts, including marketing costs, marketing salaries and benefits, as well as commissions of sales personnel. It also includes integration and transaction costs associated with acquisitions and business combinations, our overhead costs, such as salaries of administrative and corporate personnel and the leasing of facilities we occupy. General and administrative costs in our historical results for Corporate and other relate to the Algeco Group's corporate costs incurred prior to or in connection with the Business Combination which are not anticipated to be recurring costs.\nOther Depreciation and Amortization\nOther depreciation and amortization includes depreciation of our property, plant and equipment, as well as the amortization of our intangible assets.\nImpairment Losses on Goodwill\nWe recognize goodwill impairment charges associated with our reporting units when the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit.\nImpairment Losses on Long-Lived Assets\nWe recognize property, plant, and equipment impairment charges when the carrying value of assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets.\nLease Impairment Expense and Other Related Charges\nLease impairment expense and other related charges include impairment of right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets under ASC 842, gain or loss on the exit of a leased property generally associated with lease termination payments and rent expense for locations which have been closed but have not been abandoned or impaired.\nRestructuring Costs\nRestructuring costs include charges associated with exit or disposal activities that meet the definition of restructuring under Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") ASC Topic 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations ( ASC 420\u201d). Our restructuring plans are generally country or region specific and are typically completed within a one year period. Prior to the adoption of ASC 842 effective January 1, 2019, restructuring costs incurred under these plans included (i) one-time termination benefits related to employee separations, (ii) contract termination costs and, (iii) other related costs associated with exit or disposal activities including, but not limited to, costs for consolidating or closing facilities. After the adoption of ASC 842, restructuring costs include one-time termination benefits related to employee separation costs. The restructuring costs incurred in 2019 and 2018 primarily relate to the integration of our acquisitions. Costs related to the integration of acquired businesses that do not meet the definition of restructuring under ASC 420, such as employee training costs, duplicate facility costs, and professional services expenses, are included within SG&A expenses.\nCurrency (Gains) Losses, Net\nCurrency (gains) losses, net include unrealized and realized gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies other than our functional currency at the reporting date.\nOther (Income) Expense, Net\nOther (income) expense, net primarily consists of the non-recurring gain (loss) on disposal of non-operational property, plant and equipment, other financing related costs and other non-recurring charges.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of the costs of external debt including the Company's ABL credit agreement (the \"ABL Facility\"), the senior secured notes due December 15, 2022 (the \"2022 Secured Notes) and the senior secured notes due August 15, 2023 (the \"2023 Secured Notes, together with the 2022 Secured Notes, the \"Senior Secured Notes\"), the senior unsecured notes due November 15, 2023 (the \"Unsecured Notes\"), and prior to the Business Combination, interest due on amounts owed to affiliates and interest on the revolving credit facility associated with the Algeco Group.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest on notes due from affiliates which were settled in 2017.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nWe are subject to income taxes in the US, Canada and Mexico. Our overall effective tax rate is affected by a number of factors, such as the relative amounts of income we earn in differing tax jurisdictions, state and jurisdictional law changes, and certain non-deductible expenses such as compensation disallowance. The rate is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year, such as state legislation enactments. These discrete items may not be consistent from year to year. Income tax expense (benefit), deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nOur consolidated statements of net loss for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 are presented below. The below results only include results from ModSpace and Acton for the periods subsequent to their acquisition dates and does not include any incremental unrealized cost savings, revenue growth, or pro forma adjustments that management expects to result from the integration of the acquired business.\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

ended December 31, 2019 from $751.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily the result of a 43.3% increase in leasing and services revenue driven by increased volumes from acquisitions and improved pricing. Improved volumes were driven by units acquired as part of the ModSpace acquisition, as well as, increased modular delivery and installation revenues on the combined rental fleet of 42.4% due to increased transaction volumes and higher revenues per transaction. Average modular space monthly rental rates increased 11.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019, and average modular space units on rent increased 21,425 units, or 30.5%, due to the impact of an additional 8.5 months of contribution from the ModSpace acquisition. Improved pricing was driven by a combination of our price optimization tools and processes, as well as, by continued growth in our Ready to Work\u201d solutions and increased VAPS penetration across our customer base, offset partially by the average modular space monthly rental rates on acquired units for ModSpace. The increase in leasing and services revenues was further complemented by an increase of $5.5 million, or 10.3%, in new unit sales as compared to 2018. This increase was primarily driven by increased sales as a result of the ModSpace acquisition. Rental unit sales increased $15.3 million, or 61.2%, as compared to 2018.\nOn a pro forma basis, including results of WillScot and ModSpace for all periods presented, total revenues decreased $0.4 million, or 0.0%, year-over-year for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decline was driven by reduced new sales, which declined $41.6 million, or 41.3%, as a result of one large sale recognized in 2018 in the amount of $29.0 million in our Modular - US segment, and decreased rental unit sales, which declined $5.3 million, or 11.7%. The declines in sales volumes were nearly offset by an increase in our core modular leasing revenues, which increased $53.4 million, or 7.7%, as a result of a 13.7% increase in average modular space monthly rental rates.\nTotal average units on rent for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were 108,560 and 85,737, respectively. The increase was due to units acquired as part of the ModSpace acquisition, with modular space average units on rent increased by 21,425 units, or 30.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2019. Modular space average monthly rental rates increased 11.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Portable storage average units on rent increased by 1,398 units, or 9.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2019. Average portable storage monthly rental rates increased 0.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The average modular space unit utilization rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 72.0%, as compared to 71.6% in 2018. The increase in average modular space utilization rate was driven by a reduction in the combined modular space unit fleet size across the combined WillScot and ModSpace fleet in 2019. The average portable storage unit utilization rate during the year ended December 31, 2019 was 65.8%, as compared to 68.9% in 2018. The decrease in average portable storage utilization rate was driven by organic declines in the number of portable storage average units on rent in the Modular - US segment.\nGross Profit: Our gross profit percentage was 38.9% and 38.5% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our gross profit percentage, excluding the effects of depreciation (\"adjusted gross profit percentage\"), was 55.3% and 54.7% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nGross profit increased $123.9 million, or 42.8%, to $413.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $289.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in gross profit is a result of a $291.5 million increase in modular leasing and services revenue and increased new unit sales gross profit of $0.2 million, offset by increases of $120.2 million in modular leasing and services costs. Increases in modular leasing and services revenues and costs were primarily as a result of increased revenues due to additional units on rent as a result of recent acquisitions as well as increased margins due to favorable average monthly rental rates on modular space units and increased delivery and installation margins driven primarily by higher pricing per transaction. These increases were partially offset by increased depreciation of $53.3 million as a result of additional rental equipment acquired as part of the ModSpace acquisition, as well as continued capital investment in our existing rental equipment.\nSG&A Expense: SG&A expense increased $16.1 million, or 6.3%, to $271.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $254.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Employee costs increased $19.5 million driven by the increased size of the workforce, offset partially by employee savings achieved as a result of restructuring activities; and occupancy costs increased $10.3 million largely due to the expansion of our branch network and storage lots, including a portion of the expected cost savings as we have now exited approximately 85% of redundant real estate locations.\nDiscrete items included in SG&A decreased for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, by $17.7 million as decreases in transaction and integration costs related to the ModSpace and Acton acquisitions and subsequent integrations of $20.1 million and $4.0 million, respectively, were partially offset by increases in stock compensation expense and other acquisition-related activities of $3.3 million and $3.1 million, respectively.\nThe remaining increases of $4.0 million are primarily related to increased professional fees, insurance, computer, travel, office and other expenses related to operating a larger business as a result of our recent acquisitions and our expanded employee base and branch network.\nWe estimate incremental cost synergies of approximately $36.0 million related to the ModSpace and Acton acquisitions were realized in 2019, which compares to approximately $6.4 million of synergies realized in 2018 related to the Acton and Onsite Space LLC (d/b/a Tyson Onsite ( Tyson\u201d) acquisitions, bringing cumulative synergies related to the Acton, Tyson, and ModSpace acquisitions from the dates of the acquisitions to December 31, 2019 to approximately $42.4 million.\nThese cost synergies are consistent with our integration plans and we expect to achieve annual recurring cost savings of over $70.0 million once our integration plans are fully executed and in our annual results.\nOther Depreciation and Amortization: Other depreciation and amortization decreased $0.9 million, or 6.8%, to $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in other depreciation and amortization was driven primarily by lower depreciation as a result of the decrease in property, plant and equipment. Property, plant and equipment decreased as a result of the transfer of non-producing branches to assets held for sale which are no longer depreciated and the impact of the adoption of ASC 842 which resulted in the reversal of branch assets previously accounted for as failed sale-lease back locations which are compliant sales under ASC 842.\nImpairment losses on Goodwill: There were no impairment losses on goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nImpairment losses on Long-Lived Assets: Impairment losses on long-lived assets were $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. In 2019 and 2018, we reclassified certain branch facilities from property, plant and equipment to assets held for sale and recognized an impairment on these assets as the estimated fair value was less than the carrying value of the facilities.\nLease Impairment Expense and Other Related Charges: Lease impairment expense and other related charges was $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Effective January 1,2019, in connection with the adoption of ASC 842, we recorded $4.2 million in ROU asset impairments, $2.6 million in rent on closed locations and $1.9 million in lease termination fees.\nRestructuring Costs: Restructuring costs were $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The 2019 restructuring charges related primarily to employee termination costs as a result of the ModSpace acquisition and integration. The 2018 restructuring charges are comprised of employee termination and lease breakage costs related to the Acton and ModSpace acquisitions and integrations. Prior to the adoption of ASC 842 effective January 1. 2019, the costs associated with leases exited as a result of a restructuring plan were recorded in restructuring expense.\nCurrency (Gains) Losses, net: Currency (gains) losses, net were a $0.7 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a $2.5 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in currency losses was primarily attributable to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on loans and borrowings and intercompany receivables and payables denominated in a currency other than the subsidiaries' functional currency.\nOther Income, Net: Other income, net was $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in other income was driven by the receipt of insurance proceeds related to assets damaged during Hurricane Harvey and other settlements which contributed $5.6 million to other expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2018, offset by the receipt of $2.4 million in insurance proceeds related to assets damaged during hurricanes and the receipt of a $0.9 million settlement during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nInterest Expense: Interest expense increased $24.1 million, or 24.5%, to $122.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $98.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in interest expense is attributable to the increased financing costs for the full year in 2019, as a result of the ModSpace acquisition which occurred in the third quarter of 2018, offset in part by the one-time bridge financing and upfront commitment fees expensed in 2018 and lower interest costs due to the redemption of our Unsecured Notes in June 2019. In the third quarter of 2018, as part of financing the ModSpace acquisition, we upsized our ABL Facility to $1.425 billion, issued the 2023 Secured Notes, and issued the Unsecured Notes and incurred bridge financing fees and upfront commitment fees of $20.5 million which were recorded to interest expense.\nIncome Tax Benefit: Income tax benefit decreased $36.4 million to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $38.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in tax benefit was driven by the lower loss before income tax for the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately $17.0 million less tax benefit, and discrete tax benefits in 2018 related to a reduction in the valuation allowance, tax benefit of $11.9 million, and a tax benefit of $7.0 million related to a change in the Company asserting indefinite re-investment in certain of its foreign businesses.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nRevenue: Total revenue increased $305.5 million, or 68.5%, to $751.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $445.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily the result of a 73.5% increase in leasing and services revenue driven by increased volumes from acquisitions and improved pricing. Improved volumes were driven by units acquired as part of the Acton, Tyson, and ModSpace acquisitions and organic unit on rent growth, as well as increased modular delivery and installation revenues on the combined rental fleet of 72.0% due to increased transaction volumes. Average modular space monthly rental rates increased 2.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018, and average modular space units on rent increased 28,994 units, or 70.3%. Improved pricing was driven by a combination of our price optimization tools and processes, as well as by continued growth in our Ready to Work\u201d solutions and increased VAPS penetration across our customer base, offset partially by the average modular space monthly rental rates on acquired units for Acton, Tyson, and ModSpace. The increase in leasing and services revenues was further complemented by an increase of\n$17.2 million, or 47.3% in new unit sales as compared to 2017 primarily driven by increased sales as a result of the ModSpace acquisition, which historically had higher new sales than WillScot, including a single large sale project serviced by the Modular - US segment that accounted for nearly half of the revenue variance. Rental unit sales increased $3.1 million, or 14.2% as compared to 2017.\nTotal average units on rent for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were 85,737 and 53,862, respectively. The increase was due to units acquired as part of the Acton, Tyson, and ModSpace acquisitions and organic improvements in modular space average units on rent, with modular space average units on rent increased by 28,994 units, or 70.3% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Modular space average monthly rental rates increased 2.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Portable storage average units on rent increased by 2,881 units, or 22.9% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Average portable storage monthly rental rates increased 2.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The average modular space unit utilization rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 71.6%, as compared to 70.3% during the same period in 2017. The increase in average modular space utilization rate was driven by a reduction in the combined modular space unit fleet size during the period across the WillScot, ModSpace, Acton and Tyson fleet. The average portable storage unit utilization rate during the year ended December 31, 2018 was 68.9%, as compared to 71.4% during the same period in 2017. The decrease in average portable storage utilization rate was driven by organic declines in the number of portable storage average units on rent in the Modular - US segment.\nGross Profit: Our gross profit percentage was 38.5% and 37.1% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our gross profit percentage, excluding the effects of depreciation (\"adjusted gross profit percentage\"), was 54.7% and 53.4% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nGross profit increased $123.8 million, or 74.8%, to $289.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $165.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in gross profit is a result of a $285.1 million increase in modular leasing and services revenue and increased new unit sales gross profit of $6.3 million, offset by increases of $118.0 million in modular leasing and services costs. Increases in modular leasing and services revenues and costs were primarily as a result of increased revenues due to additional units on rent as a result of recent acquisitions as well as increased margins due to favorable average monthly rental rates on modular space units. These increases were partially offset by increased depreciation of $48.8 million as a result of additional rental equipment acquired as part of the Acton, Tyson, and ModSpace acquisitions, as well as continued capital investment in our existing rental equipment.\nSG&A Expense: SG&A expense increased $92.5 million, or 57.0%, to $254.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $162.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The majority of the increases in the Modular- US and Modular - Other North America segments were driven by the acquisitions of Acton and ModSpace during the year, as well as by $50.1 million of integration and transaction costs incurred during 2018 related to these acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by a $45.1 million reduction of costs in Corporate and other related to Algeco Group costs no longer included in our operations.\nSG&A expenses in the Modular- US and Modular - Other North America segments increased $137.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 2017. Integration costs incurred in 2018 were $30.0 million, as compared to no costs in 2017, which include discrete training costs, fleet relocation costs, branch exit costs, and professional service expenses related to the Acton and ModSpace integrations. Employee costs increased $43.4 million driven by the increased size of the workforce before realization of all expected employee savings to be achieved as a result of restructuring activities. Occupancy costs increased $13.8 million largely due to the expansion of our branch network and storage lots before expected savings are realized as we exit redundant locations. Transaction costs, excluding those in Corporate and other, increased $18.3 million primarily related to costs incurred related to the acquisition of ModSpace. Legal and professional fees increased $10.9 million over 2017 before realization of all expected cost savings and due to operating as a public company for all of 2018. The remaining increases of $21.3 million are primarily related to increased insurance, computer, marketing, office, tax and bad debt expenses related to operating a larger operation as a result of our recent acquisitions and our expanded employee base and branch network.\nWe estimate cost synergies of approximately $6.4 million related to the Acton and Tyson acquisitions were realized in 2018 and our integration plans remain on track. Acton sales and operations were integrated in April of 2018, and effective November 1, 2018, we began delivering all units acquired from ModSpace under a combined operating and information technology platform. Effective January 7, 2019, we completed the ModSpace system integration and all billing activities on existing ModSpace contracts are now fully integrated. Exit activities for redundant branch locations, such as preparing units and materials for transport to other locations remain on schedule. These activities are expected to continue through 2019 and we expect over $60.0 million of annual reoccurring cost savings as we execute the established integration plans for Acton and ModSpace.\nOther Depreciation and Amortization: Other depreciation and amortization increased $4.6 million, or 52.9%, to $13.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, compared to $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was driven primarily by depreciation on property, plant and equipment acquired as part of the Acton and ModSpace acquisitions in December of 2017 and August of 2018, respectively.\nImpairment losses on Goodwill: Impairment losses on goodwill were $0.0 million and $60.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The 2017 impairment loss on goodwill relates to our reporting unit in Canada.\nImpairment losses on Long-Lived Assets: Impairment losses on long-lived assets were $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $0.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we reclassified certain branch facilities that we intend to exit from property, plant and equipment to held for sale and recognized an impairment on these assets as the estimated fair value was less than the carrying value of the facilities.\nRestructuring Costs: Restructuring costs were $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The 2018 restructuring charges relate entirely to employee termination and lease breakage costs related to the Acton and ModSpace acquisitions and integrations. The 2017 restructuring charges relate to the Algeco Group corporate function and related employee termination costs.\nCurrency (Gains) Losses, net: Currency (gains) losses, net were a $2.5 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to a $12.9 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in currency gains was primarily attributable to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on loans and borrowings and intercompany receivables and payables denominated in a currency other than the subsidiaries' functional currency. The majority of the intercompany receivables and payables contributing to these gains and losses were settled concurrently with the Business Combination.\nOther (Income) Expense, Net: Other expense, net was $4.6 million of other income for the year ended December 31, 2018 and $2.8 million of other expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in other income was driven by the receipt of insurance proceeds related to assets damaged during Hurricane Harvey which contributed $4.8 million and other settlements which contributed $0.8 million to other (income) expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nInterest Expense: Interest expense decreased $20.9 million, or 17.5%, to $98.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $119.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Upon consummation of the Business Combination in November 2017, we issued the 2022 Secured Notes and entered into the ABL Facility to fund our operations as a stand-alone company. In the third quarter as part of financing the ModSpace acquisition, we upsized our ABL Facility to $1.425 billion, issued the 2023 Secured Notes, and issued the Unsecured Notes. In connection with the ModSpace acquisition, the Company incurred bridge financing fees and upfront commitment fees of $20.5 million in the third quarter, which are included in interest expense in 2018 and are not expected to reoccur.\nThe majority of the interest costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2017 relate to the previous debt structure of WSII as part of the Algeco Group, including $58.4 million of interest expense incurred in 2017 on notes payable to affiliates, which were settled in full in connection with the Algeco Group restructuring that occurred prior to the Business Combination. The decrease in interest expense is driven by our lower average debt and notes payable balances in 2018 under our new debt structure as compared to the Algeco Group debt structure in place in 2017, partially offset by bridge financing and upfront commitment fees of $20.5 million incurred in connection with the ModSpace acquisition and higher average debt balances subsequent to the August of 2018 ModSpace acquisition. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt, and the additional debt incurred during the third quarter as part of financing the ModSpace acquisition, which we expect will increase our interest expense in future periods.\nInterest Income: Interest income decreased $12.2 million, or 100.0%, to $0.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease is due to the decrease in the principal balance of notes due from affiliates, which were settled upon consummation of the Business Combination in November 2017.\nIncome Tax Benefit: Income tax benefit increased $37.7 million to $38.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in tax benefit was principally driven by the pre-tax loss tax benefit of $19.4 million, a tax benefit of $11.9 million, related to a reduction in the valuation allowance and a tax benefit of $7.0 million related to a change in the Company asserting indefinite re-investment in certain of its foreign businesses. In 2017, a pre-tax loss tax benefit was reduced by the impairment of Canadian Goodwill, an unfavorable permanent adjustment, with no tax basis which reduces the expected pre-tax loss benefit. In addition, as a result of the Tax Act, the Company remeasured their net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a net tax benefit of $28.1 million which was offset by a $50.5 million valuation allowance at December 22, 2017. Also, refer to Note 14 regarding the Tax Act enacted in the US on December 22, 2017 and additional components of the rate reconciliation.\nBusiness Segments\nOur principal line of business is modular leasing and sales. The Company formerly operated a remote accommodations business (the \"Remote Accommodations Business\"), which consisted of Target Logistics Management LLC and its subsidiaries and Chard Camp Catering Services, that was carved out in connection with the Business Combination and was no longer a part of our business as of December 31, 2017. The Remote Accommodations Business was considered a single reportable segment. Modular leasing and sales comprises two reportable segments: Modular - US and Modular - Other North America. The Modular - US reportable segment includes the contiguous 48 states and Hawaii, and the Modular - Other North America reportable segment includes Alaska, Canada and Mexico.\nThe following tables and discussion summarize our reportable segment financial information for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Consistent with the presentation of our financial statements, the below segment results only include results from Acton, Tyson, and ModSpace for the periods subsequent to the respective acquisition dates and do not include any unrealized incremental cost savings, revenue growth, or pro forma adjustments that management expects to result from the integrations of the acquired businesses. Future changes to our organizational structure may result in changes to the segments disclosed.\nBusiness Segment Results\nYears Ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands, except for units on rent and rates) </td> <td>Modular -

US Segment\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nRevenue: Total revenue increased $284.1 million, or 41.9%, to $961.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $677.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Modular leasing revenue increased $208.2 million, or 44.4%, driven by improved volumes and pricing. Average modular space units on rent increased 19,373 units, or 30.6%, to 82,709 units on rent and resulting modular space utilization increased by 50 bps. Average modular space monthly rental rates in the Modular - US segment increased 12.0% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $617. Improved volumes were driven by units acquired as part of the ModSpace acquisition, as well as increased modular delivery and installation revenues, which increased $63.2 million, or 45.7%, due to the increased delivery volumes as compared to 2018. Improved pricing was driven by a combination of our price optimization tools and processes, as well as by continued growth in our Ready to Work\u201d solutions and increased VAPS penetration across our customer base, offset partially by the average modular space monthly rental rates on acquired units. New unit sales revenue increased $5.9 million, or 12.0%, in 2019 and rental unit sales revenue increased $6.8 million, or 32.2%. Increases for both new unit sales and rental unit sales were a result of the ModSpace acquisition and our larger post-acquisition fleet size.\nOn a pro forma basis, including results of WillScot and ModSpace for all periods presented, total revenues increased $2.4 million, or 0.2%, year over year for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was driven by modular leasing revenue, which increased $52.8 million, or 8.4%, driven primarily by continued pricing improvement, with increases in pro forma average modular space monthly rental rates of $80, or 14.9%, year over year for the year ended December 31, 2019. Offset by a decline in new sales, which decreased $39.5 million, or 41.9% driven primarily by one large sale recognized in 2018 in the amount of $29.0 million, and decreased rental unit sales, which declined $9.9 million, or 26.2%. Modular space units on rent decreased 4.5% on a pro forma basis to 82,709 and pro forma utilization for our modular space units increased to 74.2% up 40 bps from 73.8% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nGross Profit: Gross profit increased $110.5 million, or 41.8%, to $374.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $264.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in gross profit was driven by higher revenues driven both by the ModSpace acquisition and by organic growth. The increase in gross profit from higher revenues was partially offset by a $50.0 million, or 47.0% increase in depreciation of rental equipment for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily related to units acquired in the ModSpace acquisition, and as a result of continued capital investment in our fleet.\nAdjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA increased $128.6 million, or 65.5%, to $325.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $196.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was driven by higher revenues and gross profits discussed above excluding depreciation, partially offset by increases in SG&A, excluding discrete items and other items, of $29.7 million. Discrete and other items within SG&A decreased for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, by $19.8 million as decreases in transaction costs and integration costs related to the ModSpace and Acton acquisitions and subsequent integrations of $19.8 million and $6.3 million, respectively, were partially offset by increases in stock compensation expense and other acquisition-related activities of $3.2 million and a $3.1 million, respectively. Increases in SG&A, excluding discrete items, primarily related to increased employee costs of $18.1 million driven by the increased size of the workforce offset partially by employee savings achieved as a result of restructuring activities; and occupancy costs increased $7.5 million largely due to the expansion of our branch network and storage lots, including a portion of the expected cost saving as we have exited redundant locations. The remaining increases in SG&A of $4.2 million were primarily related to increased insurance, computer, marketing, office, and tax expenses related to operating a larger operation as a result of our recent acquisitions and our expanded employee base and branch network.\nCapital Expenditures: Capital expenditures for rental equipment increased $42.0 million, or 27.7%, to $193.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $151.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Net capital expenditures also increased $24.4 million, or 19.0%, to $152.5 million. The increases for both were driven by increased spend for refurbishments and VAPS to drive revenue growth and for maintenance of a larger fleet following our recent acquisitions.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nRevenue: Total revenue increased $284.7 million, or 72.5%, to $677.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $392.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Modular leasing revenue increased $205.0 million, or 77.6%, driven by improved volumes and pricing. Average modular space units on rent increased 27,170 units, or 75.1% to 63,336 units on rent and resulting modular space utilization decreased by 20 bps. Average modular space monthly rental rates in the Modular - US segment increased 2.4% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $551. Improved volumes were driven by units acquired as part of the Acton, Tyson, and ModSpace acquisitions, as well as increased modular delivery and installation revenues, which increased $57.2 million, or 70.6%, due to the increased delivery volumes as compared to 2017. Improved pricing was driven by a combination of our price optimization tools and processes, as well as by continued growth in our Ready to Work\u201d solutions and increased VAPS penetration across our customer base, offset partially by the average modular space monthly rental rates on acquired units. New unit sales revenue increased $19.7 million, or 67.2%, nearly half of which was driven by a single large sale project. Rental unit sales revenue increased $2.8 million, or 15.3%, primarily a result of the ModSpace acquisition and our larger post-acquisition fleet size.\nGross Profit: Gross profit increased $115.6 million, or 77.7%, to $264.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $148.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in gross profit was driven by higher revenues driven both by the Acton, Tyson and ModSpace acquisitions and by organic growth. The increase in gross profit from higher revenues was partially offset by a $46.1 million, or 76.5% increase in depreciation of rental equipment for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily related to acquired units in the Acton, Tyson, and ModSpace acquisitions, and as a result of continued capital investment in our fleet.\nAdjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA increased $85.6 million, or 77.3%, to $196.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $110.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was driven by higher revenues and gross profits discussed above excluding depreciation, partially offset by increases in SG&A, excluding discrete items, of $81.5 million primarily related to the acquisitions of Acton and ModSpace during the year. Employee costs increased $37.9 million driven by the increased size of the workforce before realization of all expected employee savings to be achieved as a result of the restructuring activities. Occupancy costs increased $12.7 million largely due to the expansion of our branch network and storage lots before expected savings are realized as we exit redundant locations. Legal and professional fees increased $11.0 million over 2017 before realization of all expected cost savings and due to operating as a public company for all of 2018. The remaining increases of $19.9 million are primarily related to increased insurance, computer, marketing, office, tax and bad debt expenses related to operating a larger operation as a result of our recent acquisitions and our expanded employee base and branch network.\nCapital Expenditures: Capital expenditures for rental equipment increased $55.0 million, or 57.1%, to $151.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $96.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increases for both were driven by increased spend for new units, VAPS, and refurbishments as a result of the increased fleet size due to the Acton, Tyson and ModSpace acquisitions. During the year, our modular space unit fleet grew by nearly 125%, and our average modular space unit fleet grew over 70% in 2018 as compared to 2017.\nModular - Other North America Segment\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nRevenue: Total revenue increased $28.1 million, or 38.1%, to $101.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $73.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Modular leasing revenue increased $17.6 million, or 36.0%, which is primarily driven by improved volumes and pricing. Average modular space units on rent increased by 2,052 units, or 29.6% to 8,973 units on rent, and average modular space monthly rental rates in the Modular - Other North America segment increased 5.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $590. Improved volumes were driven by units acquired as part of the ModSpace acquisition, as well as increased modular delivery and installation revenues, which increased $2.3 million, or 14.0%, due to increased transaction volumes as a result of the combined company. Improved pricing was driven by a combination of our price optimization tools and processes as well as by continued growth in our Ready to Work\u201d solutions and increased VAPS penetration across our customer base, as well as by the average modular space monthly rental rates on acquired units. New unit sales revenue decreased $0.4 million, or 8.7%, associated with decreased sale opportunities. Rental unit sales revenue increased $8.6 million, or 220.5%, as a result of several large rental unit sale opportunities during the year.\nOn a pro forma basis, including results of WillScot and ModSpace for all periods presented, total revenues decreased $2.9 million, or 2.8%, year over year for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decline was driven by reduced modular delivery and installation revenues and reduced new unit sales, which declined $6.1 million, or 24.7%, and $2.2 million, or 33.7%, respectively. The decline in modular delivery and installation revenues was driven by several large projects that began or were completed during the prior year and resulted in large delivery and installation revenues. These declines were partially offset by increased rental unit sales of $4.5 million, or 56.9%. Core modular leasing revenues increased $0.8 million, or 1.3%, with increases in pro forma average modular space monthly rental rates of $25, or 4.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, being partially offset by a decrease in modular space units on rent of 2.5% on a pro forma basis to 8,973. Pro forma utilization for our modular space units decreased to 56.1%, down 30 bps from 56.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nGross Profit: Gross profit increased $13.4 million, or 53.4%, to $38.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The effects of favorable foreign currency movements increased gross profit by $0.3 million, as the Canadian Dollar and Mexican Peso strengthened against the US dollar during the year. The increase in gross profit, excluding the effects of foreign currency, was driven by higher revenues as a result of the ModSpace acquisition and organic growth. The increase in gross profit from higher revenues was partially offset by a $3.1 million, or 20.5%, increase in depreciation of rental equipment for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily related to units acquired in the ModSpace acquisition.\nAdjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA increased $12.4 million, or 64.9%, to $31.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily driven by higher modular leasing margin due to increased modular volumes and average monthly rental rates, offset by increased SG&A expense, excluding discrete items, of $4.1 million primarily related to the ModSpace acquisition. Employee costs increased $1.5 million as a result of the increased size of our workforce. Occupancy costs increased $2.8 million largely due to the expansion of our branch network and storage lots.\nCapital Expenditures: Capital expenditures for rental equipment increased $2.2 million, or 23.2%, to $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was driven by increased spend for new fleet and VAPS to drive revenue growth and for maintenance of a larger fleet following the ModSpace acquisition. Net capital expenditures decreased $5.9 million, or 98.2%, to $0.1 million, as a result of increased rental unit sales in the period.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nRevenue: Total revenue increased $20.1 million, or 37.4%, to $73.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $53.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Modular leasing revenue increased $14.8 million, or 43.4%, which is primarily attributable driven by improved volumes and pricing. Average modular space units on rent increased by 1,824 units, or 35.8% to 6,921 units on rent, and average modular space monthly rental rates in the Modular - Other North America segment increased 5.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $559. Improved volumes were driven by units acquired as part of the ModSpace acquisition, as well as increased modular delivery and installation revenues, which increased $7.6 million, or 86.4%, due to increased transaction volumes as a result of the combined company. Improved pricing was driven by a combination of our price optimization tools and processes, as well as by continued growth in our Ready to Work\u201d solutions and increased VAPS penetration across our customer base, as well as by the average modular space monthly rental rates on acquired units. New unit sales revenue decreased $2.5 million, or 35.2%, associated with decreased sale opportunities. Rental unit sales revenue increased $0.2 million, or 5.4%.\nGross Profit: Gross profit increased $7.6 million, or 43.4%, to $25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $17.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The effects of favorable foreign currency movements increased gross profit by $0.6 million, as the Canadian Dollar and Mexican Peso strengthened against the US dollar during the year. The increase in gross profit, excluding the effects of foreign currency, was driven by higher revenues as a result of the ModSpace acquisition and organic growth. The increase in gross profit from higher revenues was partially offset by a $2.8 million, or 22.8% increase in depreciation of rental equipment for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily related to acquired units in ModSpace acquisition.\nAdjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA increased $6.0 million, or 45.8%, to $19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $13.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily driven by higher modular leasing margin due to increased modular volumes and average monthly rental rates, offset by increased SG&A expense, excluding discrete items, of $4.3 million primarily related to the ModSpace acquisition during the year. Employee costs increased $2.0 million as a result of the increased size of the workforce and before realization of all expected employee savings as a result of the restructuring to capture operating synergies as a result of integrating these businesses into WillScot. Occupancy costs increased $1.0 million largely due to the expansion of our branch network and storage lots before expected savings are realized as we exit redundant locations. The remaining increases of $1.2 million are primarily related to increased insurance, computer, marketing, office, tax and bad debt expenses related to operating a larger operation as a result of our recent acquisition and our expanded employee base and branch network.\nCapital Expenditures: Capital expenditures for rental equipment increased $3.7 million, or 63.8%, to $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was driven by increased spend for new units, VAPS, and refurbishments as a result of the increased fleet size due to the ModSpace acquisition. During the year, our modular space unit fleet grew by over 65%.\nCorporate and Other for the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe Corporate and other segment was discontinued in 2017.\nGross Profit: The Corporate and other adjustments to revenue and gross profit pertain to the elimination of intercompany leasing transactions between the Modular business segments and the legacy Remote Accommodations Business segment, which was carved out in 2017 and is reflected as discontinued operations in our financial statements.\nAdjusted EBITDA: Corporate and other costs and eliminations to consolidated Adjusted EBITDA increased $15.1 million or 100.0% to $0.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from a loss of $15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The 2017 costs related to the Algeco Group operations, which separated from the Company in 2017. Similar costs incurred in 2019 and 2018 by WillScot are included primarily in the Modular - US segment.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nWillScot is a holding company that derives all of its operating cash flow from its operating subsidiaries. Our principal sources of liquidity include cash generated by operating activities from our subsidiaries, credit facilities, and sales of equity and debt securities.\nOur liquidity as of December 31, 2019 consisted of cash and cash equivalents and unused commitments under our ABL Facility which is discussed below. Our practice is to maintain sufficient liquidity through cash from operations and our ABL Facility, to mitigate the impacts of any adverse financial market conditions on our operations. We believe that cash generated\nfrom operations, together with amounts available under the ABL Facility, will be adequate to permit us to meet our obligations over the next twelve months. However, we cannot assure you that our cash provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents or cash available under our ABL Facility, will be sufficient to meet our future needs. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future, and if availability under our ABL Facility is not sufficient, we may have to obtain additional financing.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $1.6 billion of total nominal indebtedness outstanding. A substantial portion of our liquidity needs arise from debt service on our indebtedness and from the funding of our costs of operations and capital expenditures.\nWe may from time to time seek to retire our securities for cash or other consideration in open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions, exchange offers or otherwise. Additionally, we may pursue additional strategic acquisitions. Any such transactions will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.\nBorrowing Capacity and Availability\nBorrowing availability under the ABL Facility is equal to the lesser of $1.425 billion and the applicable borrowing bases (the Line Cap\u201d). The borrowing bases are a function of, among other things, the value of the assets in the relevant collateral pool. At December 31, 2019, the Line Cap was $1.425 billion and we had $509.1 million of available borrowing capacity under the ABL Facility.\nSee Note 12 in Part II, Item 8, herein for further discussion of WillScot's indebtedness.\nCash Flows\nSignificant factors driving our liquidity include cash flows generated from operating activities and capital expenditures for rental equipment. With the exception of 2017 when we incurred significant discrete costs related to the Business Combination, we historically have generated and expect to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations.\nPrior to the Business Combination in the fourth quarter of 2017, WSII was subject to a centralized cash management strategy utilized by the Algeco Group. As part of this strategy, significant intercompany notes due to and from Algeco Group affiliates were created to fund the operating needs of certain Algeco Group affiliates as well as to fund the debt obligations of the Algeco Group. The impacts of these notes are included within investing and financing activities in our 2017 consolidated statements of cash flows. Additionally, prior to the Business Combination, the activity of the Remote Accommodations Business, which is no longer part of the Company, is included within the 2017 consolidated statements of cash flows. The significant non-cash activity of the Remote Accommodations Business is discussed further in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe following summarizes our change in cash and cash equivalents cash flows for the periods presented:\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands) </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash from operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>172,566 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,149 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,362) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash from investing activities </td> <td>(152,582) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,217,202) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(392,650) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash from financing activities </td> <td>(26,063) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,180,037 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>396,833 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>166 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(211) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>202 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,913) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(227) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,023 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 and December 31, 2018 and 2017\nCash Flows from operating activities\nCash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $172.6 million as compared to $37.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $135.5 million. This increase was primarily due to a $159.1 million increase in net income, adjusted for non-cash items, in 2019 as compared to 2018, as a result of the impact of the ModSpace acquisition on operations, which is reflected in our results for all of 2019, but is only included for four and a half months in 2018. This increase in net income, adjusted for non-cash items, was partially offset by a decrease of $23.7 million in the net movements of the operating assets and liabilities. The decrease in operating assets and liabilities was attributable to an increase in trade receivables and an increase in cash interest payments during the year ended December 31, 2019, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.\nCash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $37.1 million as compared to cash used in operating activities of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $38.5 million. This was primarily due to a $30.1 million increase of net income, adjusted for non-cash items, during 2018 as compared to 2017 due to the impact of the Acton, Tyson, and ModSpace acquisitions on revenue and gross profit. An $8.5 million increase in the net movements of the operating assets and liabilities also contributed to the overall increase in cash provided by operating activities. This increase was driven by lower interest payments in 2018 compared to 2017, offset partially by higher use of cash\nto pay down accounts payable and accrued liabilities, both associated with transaction expenses incurred for the Business Combination as well as normal operating liabilities.\nCash flows from investing activities\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $152.6 million as compared to $1,217.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $1,064.6 million. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was driven by a $1,083.1 million decrease in cash used for business acquisitions, an $11.3 million increase in proceeds from the sale of rental equipment, and an $18.1 million increase in proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment. The decrease in cash used in business acquisitions was due to the acquisition of ModSpace during the year ended December 31, 2018, with no business acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2019. Proceeds from the sale of rental equipment increased due to increased sales volume as a result of the acquisition of ModSpace. Proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment increased primarily as a result of the sale of non-operating branch locations during the year ended December 31, 2019, as part of the ongoing integration and consolidation process following the acquisition of ModSpace. The overall decrease in cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures of $44.2 million in 2019, which was primarily driven by increased refurbishments of existing fleet, following our recent acquisitions, and purchases of VAPS to drive revenue growth.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $1,217.2 million as compared to $392.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $824.5 million. This increase was principally the result of an increase in cash used of $846.0 million for the acquisition of businesses and an increase in cash used of $49.2 million for the purchase of rental equipment. In 2018, we acquired ModSpace and Tyson for combined cash consideration of $1,083.1 million compared to the acquisition of Acton in 2017 for cash consideration of $237.1 million. We incurred capital expenditures for the purchase of rental equipment of $160.9 million and $111.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures was driven primarily by strategic investment in refurbishment of existing fleet, purchase of VAPS, and new fleet purchases to maintain and grow units on rent. The increase in cash used in investing activities was partially offset by a $67.8 million decrease in cash used in lending activities to affiliates. In 2018, we did not engage in any lending activities as the notes due from affiliates were settled as part of the Business Combination in 2017.\nCash flows from financing activities\nCash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $26.1 million as compared to $1,180.0 million cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $1,206.1 million cash used. The increase in cash used by financing activities is primarily due to a reduction in borrowings, net of repayments of $1,086.0 million, a decrease in receipts from the issuance of common stock of $146.3 million primarily related to the financing of the ModSpace acquisition and an increase in debt extinguishment costs of $7.1 million. In connection with the ModSpace acquisition, in 2018 we borrowed an aggregate of $1,097.1 million related to the issuance of the 2023 Secured Notes and the Unsecured Notes, and through the up-sized ABL Facility. The 2018 stock issuance was used to finance the acquisition of ModSpace. We paid redemption premium costs of $7.1 million in 2019 as a result of the redemption of the Unsecured Notes and the $30.0 million prepayment on the 2022 Secured Notes. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by a decrease in financing fees payments of $34.0 million due to the significant fees incurred in 2018 as part of the financing activities noted above in connected with the acquisition of ModSpace.\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $1,180.0 million as compared to $396.8 million cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $783.2 million. The increase is primarily driven by a $1,093.2 million increase in borrowings net of repayments and a $123.9 million decrease in net repayments on notes due to affiliates. In order to finance the cash consideration for the acquisition of ModSpace in the third quarter of 2018, we issued $300.0 million of 2023 Secured Notes, issued $200.0 million of Unsecured Notes, and borrowed an additional $597.1 million on the up-sized ABL Facility, which drove the overall increase in borrowings, net of repayments. In 2017, in connection with the Business Combination, the obligations under the notes due to affiliates were settled and there was no activity related to these notes in 2018. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by a $424.6 million decrease in cash receipts from the issuance of common stock. We had cash receipts of $147.2 million and $571.8 million from the issuance of common stock during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The 2018 stock issuance was used to finance the acquisition of ModSpace and the 2017 stock issuance was made in connection with the Business Combination.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents information relating to our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2019:\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands) </td> <td>Total </td> <td>Less than 1 year </td> <td>Between 1 to 3 Years </td> <td>Between 3 and 5 years </td> <td>More than 5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term indebtedness, including current portion and interest(a)(b)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,965,362 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>103,505 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,350,802 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>511,055 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease liabilities </td> <td>185,847 </td> <td> </td> <td>37,648 </td> <td> </td> <td>61,672 </td> <td> </td> <td>38,611 </td> <td> </td> <td>47,916 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,151,209 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>141,153 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,412,474 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>549,666 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,916 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a) Long-term indebtedness includes borrowings and interest under the ABL Facility and the Senior Secured Notes.\n(b) Includes the obligations under our interest rate swap agreement that effectively convert $400.0 million in aggregate notional amount of variable-rate debt under the Company's ABL Facility into fixed-rate debt. The future obligations under the interest rate swaps was calculated using the 1-month LIBOR rate as of December 31, 2019.\nAt December 31, 2019, in addition to the above contractual obligations, the Company had $22.6 million of potential long-term tax liabilities, including interest and penalties, related to uncertain tax positions. Because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the future cash flows associated with these potential long-term tax liabilities, the Company is unable to estimate the years in which settlement will occur with the respective taxing authorities.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we consider reasonable under the circumstances, and reevaluate our estimates and judgments as appropriate. The actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity in the preparation of financial statements:\nRevenue Recognition\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.\nModular Leasing and Services Revenue\nThe majority of revenue is generated by rental income subject to the guidance of ASC 840, Leases (\"ASC 840\") in 2017 and 2018 and ASC 842 in 2019. The remaining revenue is generated by performance obligations in contracts with customers for services or sale of units subject to the guidance in ASC 605, Revenue (\"ASC 605\"), in 2017 and 2018 and ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (\"ASC 606\") in 2019.\nLeasing Revenue\nIncome from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company's lease arrangements typically include multiple lease and non-lease components. Examples of lease components include, but are not limited to, the lease of modular space or portable storage units, and examples of non-lease components include, but are not limited to, the delivery, installation, maintenance, and removal services commonly provided in a bundled transaction with the lease components. Arrangement consideration is allocated between lease deliverables and non-lease components based on the relative estimated selling (leasing) price of each deliverable. Estimated selling (leasing) price of the lease deliverables is based upon the estimated stand-alone selling price of the related performance obligations using an adjusted market approach.\nWhen leases and services are billed in advance, recognition of revenue is deferred until services are rendered. If equipment is returned prior to the contractually obligated period, the excess, if any, between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay over the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date is recognized as incremental revenue upon return.\nRental equipment is leased primarily under operating leases and, from time to time, under sales-type lease arrangements. Operating lease minimum contractual terms generally range from 1 month to 60 months and averaged approximately 12 months across the Company's rental fleet for the year ended December 31, 2019. There were no material sales-type lease arrangements as of December 31, 2019.\nThe adoption of ASC 842 at January 1, 2019, did not have a significant impact on the recognition of leasing revenue. Per the requirements of ASC 842 the Company records changes in estimated collectibility, directly against leasing revenue.\nServices Revenue\nThe Company generally has three non-lease service-related performance obligations in its contracts with customers:\n\u2022Delivery and installation of the modular or portable storage unit;\n\u2022Maintenance and other ad hoc services performed during the lease term; and\n\u2022Removal services that occur at the end of the lease term.\nConsideration is allocated to each of these performance obligations within the contract based upon their estimated relative standalone selling prices using the estimated cost plus a margin approach. Revenue from these activities is recognized as the services are performed.\nSales Revenue\nSales revenue is generated by the sale of new and rental units. Revenue from the sale of new and rental units is generally recognized at a point in time upon the transfer of control to the customer, which occurs when the unit is delivered and installed in accordance with the contract. Sales transactions constitute a single performance obligation.\nOther Matters\nThe Company's non-lease revenues do not include material amounts of variable consideration, other than the variability noted for services arrangements expected to be performed beyond a twelve month period.\nThe Company's payment terms vary by the type and location of its customer and the product or services offered. The time between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. While the Company may bill certain customers in advance, its contracts do not contain a significant financing component based on the short length of time between upfront billings and the performance of contracted services. For certain products, services, or customer types, the Company requires payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer.\nRevenue is recognized net of taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\nGoodwill and Goodwill Impairment\nFor acquired businesses, the Company records assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the respective acquisition dates. Based on these values, the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Generally, reporting units are one level below the operating segment (the component level), if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is assigned to each of the Company's reporting units that are expected to benefit from the combination.\nThe Company performs its annual impairment test of goodwill as of October 1 at the reporting unit level, as well as during any reporting period in which events or changes in circumstances that, in management's judgment, may constitute triggering events under ASC 350-20, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, Testing Goodwill for Impairment. The Company uses an independent valuation specialist for its annual impairment tests to assist in the valuation.\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, value of net operating losses, future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. Management bases fair value estimates on assumptions it believes to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from these estimates.\nIf the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the calculated fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment charge would be recognized for the excess, not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nPurchase Accounting\nWe account for acquisitions of businesses under the acquisition method. Under the acquisition method of accounting, we record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair value on the date of acquisition. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable net assets. Estimated fair values of acquired assets and liabilities are provisional and could change as additional information is received. Valuations are finalized as soon as practicable, but not later than one year from the acquisition date. Any subsequent changes to purchase price allocations result in a corresponding adjustment to goodwill.\nRental Equipment\nRental equipment is comprised of modular space and portable storage units held for rent or on rent to customers and VAPS which are in use or available to be used by customers. Rental equipment is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Costs of improvements and betterments to rental equipment are capitalized when such costs extend the useful life of the equipment or increase the rental value of the unit. Costs incurred for equipment to meet a particular customer specification are capitalized and depreciated over the lease term taking in consideration the residual value of the asset. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.\nDepreciation is generally computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, as follows:\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Estimated Useful Life </td> <td> </td> <td>Residual Value </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Modular space and portable storage units </td> <td>10 - 20 years </td> <td> </td> <td>20 - 50% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>VAPS and other related rental equipment </td> <td>2 - 8 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTrade Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nTrade receivables primarily consist of amounts due from customers from the lease or sale of rental equipment and their delivery and installation. Trade accounts receivable are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon the amount of losses expected to be incurred in the collection of these accounts. These estimated losses are calculated using the loss rate method based upon a review of outstanding receivables, related aging, including specific accounts if deemed necessary and on historical collection experience. In accordance with the adoption of ASC 842, effective January 1, 2019, specifically identifiable operating lease receivables not deemed probable of collection are recorded as a reduction of revenue. The remaining provision for doubtful accounts is recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the entire provision for doubtful accounts is recorded as a selling, general and administrative expense. The Company reviews the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe Company records deferred tax assets to the extent it believes that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized. In making such determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent results of operations. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized.\nThe Company assesses the likelihood that each of the deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent management believes realization of any deferred tax assets is not likely, the Company establishes a valuation allowance. When a valuation allowance is established or there is an increase in an allowance in a reporting period, tax expense is generally recorded in the Company's consolidated statement of operations. Conversely, to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary, that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed, which generally reduces the Company's income tax expense.\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognized for the income taxes on the undistributed earnings of wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries unless such earnings are permanently reinvested, or will only be repatriated when possible to do so at minimal additional tax cost. Current income tax relating to items recognized directly in equity is recognized in equity and not in profit (loss) for the year.\nIn accordance with applicable authoritative guidance, the Company accounts for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach; a more-likely-than-not recognition criterion; and a measurement approach that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If it is not more-likely-than-not that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits, no benefit is recorded. Uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold. The Company classifies interest on tax deficiencies and income tax penalties within income tax expense.", "item_7_truncated": "Restructuring Costs\n-Average modular space monthly utilization decreased by 70 bps to 56.1% in 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018.\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands, except unit numbers and rates) </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Modular space units on rent (average during the period) </td> <td>91,682 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,263 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average modular space utilization rate </td> <td>72.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>71.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>70.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average modular space monthly rental rate </td> <td>$ </td> <td>614 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>552 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>538 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Portable storage units on rent (average during the period) </td> <td>16,878 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,480 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,599 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average portable storage utilization rate </td> <td>65.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>68.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>71.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average portable storage monthly rental rate </td> <td>$ </td> <td>120 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>119 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>116 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRestructuring costs include charges associated with exit or disposal activities that meet the definition of restructuring under Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") ASC Topic 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations ( ASC 420\u201d).

Prior to the adoption of ASC 842 effective January 1, 2019, restructuring costs incurred under these plans included (i) one-time termination benefits related to employee separations, (ii) contract termination costs and, (iii) other related costs associated with exit or disposal activities including, but not limited to, costs for consolidating or closing facilities. After the adoption of ASC 842, restructuring costs include one-time termination benefits related to employee separation costs.

This was primarily due to a $30.1 million increase of net income, adjusted for non-cash items, during 2018 as compared to 2017 due to the impact of the Acton, Tyson, and ModSpace acquisitions on revenue and gross profit. An $8.5 million increase in the net movements of the operating assets and liabilities also contributed to the overall increase in cash provided by operating activities. This increase was driven by lower interest payments in 2018 compared to 2017, offset partially by higher use of cash\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

85,737, respectively. The increase was due to units acquired as part of the ModSpace acquisition, with modular space average units on rent increased by 21,425 units, or 30.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2019. Modular space average monthly rental rates increased 11.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Portable storage average units on rent increased by 1,398 units, or 9.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2019. Average portable storage monthly rental rates increased 0.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The average modular space unit utilization rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 72.0%, as compared to 71.6% in 2018. The increase in average modular space utilization rate was driven by a reduction in the combined modular space unit fleet size across the combined WillScot and ModSpace fleet in 2019. The average portable storage unit utilization rate during the year ended December 31, 2019 was 65.8%, as compared to 68.9% in 2018. The decrease in average portable storage utilization rate was driven by organic declines in the number of portable storage average units on rent in the Modular - US segment.\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands, except for units on rent and rates) </td> <td>Modular - US </td> <td> </td> <td>Modular - Other North America </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>961,683 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>101,982 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,063,665 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td>$ </td> <td>374,859 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,454 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>413,313 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA(a)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>325,068 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,480 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>356,548 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures for rental equipment </td> <td>$ </td> <td>193,453 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,653 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>205,106 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Modular space units on rent (average during the period) </td> <td>82,709 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,973 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91,682 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average modular space utilization rate </td> <td>74.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>56.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>72.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average modular space monthly rental rate </td> <td>$ </td> <td>617 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>590 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>614 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Portable storage units on rent (average during the period) </td> <td>16,462 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>416 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,878 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average portable storage utilization rate </td> <td>66.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>53.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>65.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average portable storage monthly rental rate </td> <td>$ </td> <td>120 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>111 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>120 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n2019 was a transformational year for WillScot as we completed our integration of ModSpace and realized significant cost synergies from both the ModSpace and Acton strategic transactions.

These pro forma results include realized cost savings from the ModSpace and Acton acquisitions, and incremental revenue growth from increased penetration of \"Ready to Work\" solutions across the combined portfolio, but do not include any additional cost savings that management expects to realize in future years.\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands, except for units on rent and rates) </td> <td>Modular - US </td> <td> </td> <td>Modular - Other North America </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>677,590 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>73,822 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>751,412 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td>$ </td> <td>264,320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,064 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>289,384 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA(a)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>196,410 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,123 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>215,533 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures for rental equipment </td> <td>$ </td> <td>151,407 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,476 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>160,883 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Modular space units on rent (average during the period) </td> <td>63,336 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,921 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,257 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average modular space utilization rate </td> <td>73.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>56.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>71.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average modular space monthly rental rate </td> <td>$ </td> <td>551 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>559 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>552 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Portable storage units on rent (average during the period) </td> <td>15,089 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>391 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,480 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average portable storage utilization rate </td> <td>69.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>55.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>68.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average portable storage monthly rental rate </td> <td>$ </td> <td>119 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>108 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>119 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe intend to maintain a leading market position and increase our revenue and profitability by pursuing the following strategies:\nRental equipment is leased primarily under operating leases and, from time to time, under sales-type lease arrangements. Operating lease minimum contractual terms generally range from 1 month to 60 months and averaged approximately 12 months across the Company's rental fleet for the year ended December 31, 2019. There were no material sales-type lease arrangements as of December 31, 2019.\nOur revenue consists mainly of leasing, services and sales revenue. We derive our leasing and services revenue primarily from the leasing of modular space and portable storage units. Included in modular leasing revenue are VAPS, such as rentals of steps, ramps, furniture, air conditioners, wireless internet access points, damage waivers and service plans. Modular delivery and installation revenue includes fees that we charge for the delivery, setup, knockdown and pick-up of leasing equipment to and from customers' premises and repositioning leasing equipment.\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands) </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash from operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>172,566 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,149 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,362) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash from investing activities </td> <td>(152,582) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,217,202) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(392,650) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash from financing activities </td> <td>(26,063) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,180,037 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>396,833 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>166 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(211) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>202 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,913) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(227) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,023 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverview\nAdjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA increased $85.6 million, or 77.3%, to $196.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $110.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was driven by higher revenues and gross profits discussed above excluding depreciation, partially offset by increases in SG&A, excluding discrete items, of $81.5 million primarily related to the acquisitions of Acton and ModSpace during the year. Employee costs increased $37.9 million driven by the increased size of the workforce before realization of all expected employee savings to be achieved as a result of the restructuring activities. Occupancy costs increased $12.7 million largely due to the expansion of our branch network and storage lots before expected savings are realized as we exit redundant locations. Legal and professional fees increased $11.0 million over 2017 before realization of all expected cost savings and due to operating as a public company for all of 2018. The remaining increases of $19.9 million are primarily related to increased insurance, computer, marketing, office, tax and bad debt expenses related to operating a larger operation as a result of our recent acquisitions and our expanded employee base and branch network.\nFor acquired businesses, the Company records assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the respective acquisition dates. Based on these values, the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Generally, reporting units are one level below the operating segment (the component level), if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is assigned to each of the Company's reporting units that are expected to benefit from the combination.\nRevenue: Total revenue increased $20.1 million, or 37.4%, to $73.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $53.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Modular leasing revenue increased $14.8 million, or 43.4%, which is primarily attributable driven by improved volumes and pricing. Average modular space units on rent increased by 1,824 units, or 35.8% to 6,921 units on rent, and average modular space monthly rental rates in the Modular - Other North America segment increased 5.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $559. Improved volumes were driven by units acquired as part of the ModSpace acquisition, as well as increased modular delivery and installation revenues, which increased $7.6 million, or 86.4%, due to increased transaction volumes as a result of the combined company. Improved pricing was driven by a combination of our price optimization tools and processes, as well as by continued growth in our Ready to Work\u201d solutions and increased VAPS penetration across our customer base, as well as by the average modular space monthly rental rates on acquired units. New unit sales revenue decreased $2.5 million, or 35.2%, associated with decreased sale opportunities. Rental unit sales revenue increased $0.2 million, or 5.4%.\n\u2022Modular - Other North America segment which represents 9.6% of revenues in 2019, increased by $28.1 million, or 38.1% as compared to the same period in 2018. Increases were driven primarily by:\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $152.6 million as compared to $1,217.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $1,064.6 million. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was driven by a $1,083.1 million decrease in cash used for business acquisitions, an $11.3 million increase in proceeds from the sale of rental equipment, and an $18.1 million increase in proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment. The decrease in cash used in business acquisitions was due to the acquisition of ModSpace during the year ended December 31, 2018, with no business acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2019. Proceeds from the sale of rental equipment increased due to increased sales volume as a result of the acquisition of ModSpace. Proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment increased primarily as a result of the sale of non-operating branch locations during the year ended December 31, 2019, as part of the ongoing integration and consolidation process following the acquisition of ModSpace. The overall decrease in cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures of $44.2 million in 2019, which was primarily driven by increased refurbishments of existing fleet, following our recent acquisitions, and purchases of VAPS to drive revenue growth.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOther Income, Net: Other income, net was $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in other income was driven by the receipt of insurance proceeds related to assets damaged during Hurricane Harvey and other settlements which contributed $5.6 million to other expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2018, offset by the receipt of $2.4 million in insurance proceeds related to assets damaged during hurricanes and the receipt of a $0.9 million settlement during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nGoodwill and Goodwill Impairment\nIncreasing the Utilization and Yield of our Rental Equipment.\nCapital Expenditures: Capital expenditures for rental equipment increased $55.0 million, or 57.1%, to $151.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $96.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increases for both were driven by increased spend for new units, VAPS, and refurbishments as a result of the increased fleet size due to the Acton, Tyson and ModSpace acquisitions. During the year, our modular space unit fleet grew by nearly 125%, and our average modular space unit fleet grew over 70% in 2018 as compared to 2017.\nRevenue: Total revenue increased $284.7 million, or 72.5%, to $677.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $392.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Modular leasing revenue increased $205.0 million, or 77.6%, driven by improved volumes and pricing. Average modular space units on rent increased 27,170 units, or 75.1% to 63,336 units on rent and resulting modular space utilization decreased by 20 bps. Average modular space monthly rental rates in the Modular - US segment increased 2.4% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $551. Improved volumes were driven by units acquired as part of the Acton, Tyson, and ModSpace acquisitions, as well as increased modular delivery and installation revenues, which increased $57.2 million, or 70.6%, due to the increased delivery volumes as compared to 2017. Improved pricing was driven by a combination of our price optimization tools and processes, as well as by continued growth in our Ready to Work\u201d solutions and increased VAPS penetration across our customer base, offset partially by the average modular space monthly rental rates on acquired units. New unit sales revenue increased $19.7 million, or 67.2%, nearly half of which was driven by a single large sale project. Rental unit sales revenue increased $2.8 million, or 15.3%, primarily a result of the ModSpace acquisition and our larger post-acquisition fleet size.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\n\nWe estimate incremental cost synergies of approximately $36.0 million related to the ModSpace and Acton acquisitions were realized in 2019, which compares to approximately $6.4 million of synergies realized in 2018 related to the Acton and Onsite Space LLC (d/b/a Tyson Onsite ( Tyson\u201d) acquisitions, bringing cumulative synergies related to the Acton, Tyson, and ModSpace acquisitions from the dates of the acquisitions to December 31, 2019 to approximately $42.4 million.\n\n\u2022Modular - US segment revenues, which represented 90.4% of revenues in 2019, increased by $284.1 million, or 41.9%, as compared to 2018, through:\nWe may from time to time seek to retire our securities for cash or other consideration in open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions, exchange offers or otherwise. Additionally, we may pursue additional strategic acquisitions. Any such transactions will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.\nto pay down accounts payable and accrued liabilities, both associated with transaction expenses incurred for the Business Combination as well as normal operating liabilities.\nSee Note 12 in Part II, Item 8, herein for further discussion of WillScot's indebtedness.\nInterest expense consists of the costs of external debt including the Company's ABL credit agreement (the \"ABL Facility\"), the senior secured notes due December 15, 2022 (the \"2022 Secured Notes) and the senior secured notes due August 15, 2023 (the \"2023 Secured Notes, together with the 2022 Secured Notes, the \"Senior Secured Notes\"), the senior unsecured notes due November 15, 2023 (the \"Unsecured Notes\"), and prior to the Business Combination, interest due on amounts owed to affiliates and interest on the revolving credit facility associated with the Algeco Group.\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, value of net operating losses, future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. Management bases fair value estimates on assumptions it believes to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from these estimates.\nBusiness Environment and Outlook\nOther Depreciation and Amortization: Other depreciation and amortization increased $4.6 million, or 52.9%, to $13.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, compared to $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was driven primarily by depreciation on property, plant and equipment acquired as part of the Acton and ModSpace acquisitions in December of 2017 and August of 2018, respectively.\nTrade receivables primarily consist of amounts due from customers from the lease or sale of rental equipment and their delivery and installation. Trade accounts receivable are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon the amount of losses expected to be incurred in the collection of these accounts. These estimated losses are calculated using the loss rate method based upon a review of outstanding receivables, related aging, including specific accounts if deemed necessary and on historical collection experience. In accordance with the adoption of ASC 842, effective January 1, 2019, specifically identifiable operating lease receivables not deemed probable of collection are recorded as a reduction of revenue. The remaining provision for doubtful accounts is recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the entire provision for doubtful accounts is recorded as a selling, general and administrative expense. The Company reviews the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 and December 31, 2018 and 2017\n(b) Includes the obligations under our interest rate swap agreement that effectively convert $400.0 million in aggregate notional amount of variable-rate debt under the Company's ABL Facility into fixed-rate debt. The future obligations under the interest rate swaps was calculated using the 1-month LIBOR rate as of December 31, 2019.\nSignificant factors driving our liquidity include cash flows generated from operating activities and capital expenditures for rental equipment. With the exception of 2017 when we incurred significant discrete costs related to the Business Combination, we historically have generated and expect to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations.\nRental equipment is comprised of modular space and portable storage units held for rent or on rent to customers and VAPS which are in use or available to be used by customers. Rental equipment is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Costs of improvements and betterments to rental equipment are capitalized when such costs extend the useful life of the equipment or increase the rental value of the unit. Costs incurred for equipment to meet a particular customer specification are capitalized and depreciated over the lease term taking in consideration the residual value of the asset. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.\n\u2022Removal services that occur at the end of the lease term.\nOur customers operate in a diversified set of end markets, including commercial and industrial, construction, education, energy and natural resources, government and other end markets. We track several market leading indicators including those related to our two largest end markets, the commercial and industrial segment and the construction segment, which collectively accounted for approximately 80% of our revenues in the year ended December 31, 2019. Market fundamentals underlying these markets are currently stable, and we expect continued modest market growth in the next several years. Current conditions, and potential growth drivers such as a robust U.S. economy, increased infrastructure spending, and continued penetration of our customer base with our VAPS offering provide us confidence in continued demand for our products.\nWe recognize property, plant, and equipment impairment charges when the carrying value of assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets.\nOur principal line of business is modular leasing and sales. The Company formerly operated a remote accommodations business (the \"Remote Accommodations Business\"), which consisted of Target Logistics Management LLC and its subsidiaries and Chard Camp Catering Services, that was carved out in connection with the Business Combination and was no longer a part of our business as of December 31, 2017. The Remote Accommodations Business was considered a single reportable segment. Modular leasing and sales comprises two reportable segments: Modular - US and Modular - Other North America. The Modular - US reportable segment includes the contiguous 48 states and Hawaii, and the Modular - Other North America reportable segment includes Alaska, Canada and Mexico.\n-Modular space units on rent decreased 4.3% year over year, and utilization increased 30 bps.\nAdjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA increased $128.6 million, or 65.5%, to $325.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $196.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was driven by higher revenues and gross profits discussed above excluding depreciation, partially offset by increases in SG&A, excluding discrete items and other items, of $29.7 million. Discrete and other items within SG&A decreased for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, by $19.8 million as decreases in transaction costs and integration costs related to the ModSpace and Acton acquisitions and subsequent integrations of $19.8 million and $6.3 million, respectively, were partially offset by increases in stock compensation expense and other acquisition-related activities of $3.2 million and a $3.1 million, respectively. Increases in SG&A, excluding discrete items, primarily related to increased employee costs of $18.1 million driven by the increased size of the workforce offset partially by employee savings achieved as a result of restructuring activities; and occupancy costs increased $7.5 million largely due to the expansion of our branch network and storage lots, including a portion of the expected cost saving as we have exited redundant locations. The remaining increases in SG&A of $4.2 million were primarily related to increased insurance, computer, marketing, office, and tax expenses related to operating a larger operation as a result of our recent acquisitions and our expanded employee base and branch network.\nIncome Tax Benefit: Income tax benefit decreased $36.4 million to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $38.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in tax benefit was driven by the lower loss before income tax for the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately $17.0 million less tax benefit, and discrete tax benefits in 2018 related to a reduction in the valuation allowance, tax benefit of $11.9 million, and a tax benefit of $7.0 million related to a change in the Company asserting indefinite re-investment in certain of its foreign businesses.\nGross profit increased $123.9 million, or 42.8%, to $413.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $289.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in gross profit is a result of a $291.5 million increase in modular leasing and services revenue and increased new unit sales gross profit of $0.2 million, offset by increases of $120.2 million in modular leasing and services costs. Increases in modular leasing and services revenues and costs were primarily as a result of increased revenues due to additional units on rent as a result of recent acquisitions as well as increased margins due to favorable average monthly rental rates on modular space units and increased delivery and installation margins driven primarily by higher pricing per transaction. These increases were partially offset by increased depreciation of $53.3 million as a result of additional rental equipment acquired as part of the ModSpace acquisition, as well as continued capital investment in our existing rental equipment.\n\n\nThe Company assesses the likelihood that each of the deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent management believes realization of any deferred tax assets is not likely, the Company establishes a valuation allowance. When a valuation allowance is established or there is an increase in an allowance in a reporting period, tax expense is generally recorded in the Company's consolidated statement of operations. Conversely, to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary, that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed, which generally reduces the Company's income tax expense.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nBusiness Segments\n\u2022Generated consolidated net loss of $11.5 million, which included an $8.8 million loss on extinguishment of debt and $46.0 million of discrete costs expensed in the period related to the ModSpace integration and other acquisition-related activities, including $26.6 million of integration costs, $11.5 million of impairment of long-lived assets and lease impairment expense and other related charges, $3.8 million of restructuring cost, and $4.1 of other expense. The consolidated net loss of $11.5 million represented an improvement of $42.1 million as compared to the same period in 2018.\nThe average utilization rate of our modular lease units is the ratio of (i) the average number of units in use during a period (which includes units from the time they are leased to a customer until the time they are returned to us) to (ii) the average total number of units available for lease in our modular fleet during a period. Our average monthly rental rate per unit for a period is equal to the ratio of (i) our rental income for that period including VAPS but excluding delivery and installation services, to (ii) the average number of modular lease units rented to our customers during that period.\nImpairment losses on Goodwill: Impairment losses on goodwill were $0.0 million and $60.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The 2017 impairment loss on goodwill relates to our reporting unit in Canada.\nfrom operations, together with amounts available under the ABL Facility, will be adequate to permit us to meet our obligations over the next twelve months. However, we cannot assure you that our cash provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents or cash available under our ABL Facility, will be sufficient to meet our future needs. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future, and if availability under our ABL Facility is not sufficient, we may have to obtain additional financing.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, 9.6% of our revenues were from the Modular - Other North America segment, markets in Canada, including Alaska, and Mexico. Revenues from this segment had declined since 2014 as a result of exposure to upstream oil and gas end markets in Alberta, Canada and Alaska. While average modular space units on rent and rental rates have stabilized, competitive pressures in these markets may continue to impact performance until utilization across the industry improves.\nGross Profit: Gross profit increased $115.6 million, or 77.7%, to $264.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $148.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in gross profit was driven by higher revenues driven both by the Acton, Tyson and ModSpace acquisitions and by organic growth. The increase in gross profit from higher revenues was partially offset by a $46.1 million, or 76.5% increase in depreciation of rental equipment for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily related to acquired units in the Acton, Tyson, and ModSpace acquisitions, and as a result of continued capital investment in our fleet.\nRevenue: Total revenue increased $312.3 million, or 41.6%, to $1,063.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $751.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily the result of a 43.3% increase in leasing and services revenue driven by increased volumes from acquisitions and improved pricing. Improved volumes were driven by units acquired as part of the ModSpace acquisition, as well as, increased modular delivery and installation revenues on the combined rental fleet of 42.4% due to increased transaction volumes and higher revenues per transaction. Average modular space monthly rental rates increased 11.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019, and average modular space units on rent increased 21,425 units, or 30.5%, due to the impact of an additional 8.5 months of contribution from the ModSpace acquisition. Improved pricing was driven by a combination of our price optimization tools and processes, as well as, by continued growth in our Ready to Work\u201d solutions and increased VAPS penetration across our customer base, offset partially by the average modular space monthly rental rates on acquired units for ModSpace. The increase in leasing and services revenues was further complemented by an increase of $5.5 million, or 10.3%, in new unit sales as compared to 2018. This increase was primarily driven by increased sales as a result of the ModSpace acquisition. Rental unit sales increased $15.3 million, or 61.2%, as compared to 2018.\nRevenue: Total revenue increased $28.1 million, or 38.1%, to $101.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $73.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Modular leasing revenue increased $17.6 million, or 36.0%, which is primarily driven by improved volumes and pricing. Average modular space units on rent increased by 2,052 units, or 29.6% to 8,973 units on rent, and average modular space monthly rental rates in the Modular - Other North America segment increased 5.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $590. Improved volumes were driven by units acquired as part of the ModSpace acquisition, as well as increased modular delivery and installation revenues, which increased $2.3 million, or 14.0%, due to increased transaction volumes as a result of the combined company. Improved pricing was driven by a combination of our price optimization tools and processes as well as by continued growth in our Ready to Work\u201d solutions and increased VAPS penetration across our customer base, as well as by the average modular space monthly rental rates on acquired units. New unit sales revenue decreased $0.4 million, or 8.7%, associated with decreased sale opportunities. Rental unit sales revenue increased $8.6 million, or 220.5%, as a result of several large rental unit sale opportunities during the year.\n\nAt December 31, 2019, in addition to the above contractual obligations, the Company had $22.6 million of potential long-term tax liabilities, including interest and penalties, related to uncertain tax positions. Because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the future cash flows associated with these potential long-term tax liabilities, the Company is unable to estimate the years in which settlement will occur with the respective taxing authorities.\nRental Equipment\nIf the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the calculated fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment charge would be recognized for the excess, not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nImpairment losses on Goodwill: There were no impairment losses on goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nSG&A Expense: SG&A expense increased $92.5 million, or 57.0%, to $254.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $162.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The majority of the increases in the Modular- US and Modular - Other North America segments were driven by the acquisitions of Acton and ModSpace during the year, as well as by $50.1 million of integration and transaction costs incurred during 2018 related to these acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by a $45.1 million reduction of costs in Corporate and other related to Algeco Group costs no longer included in our operations.\nPrior to the Business Combination in the fourth quarter of 2017, WSII was subject to a centralized cash management strategy utilized by the Algeco Group. As part of this strategy, significant intercompany notes due to and from Algeco Group affiliates were created to fund the operating needs of certain Algeco Group affiliates as well as to fund the debt obligations of the Algeco Group. The impacts of these notes are included within investing and financing activities in our 2017 consolidated statements of cash flows. Additionally, prior to the Business Combination, the activity of the Remote Accommodations Business, which is no longer part of the Company, is included within the 2017 consolidated statements of cash flows. The significant non-cash activity of the Remote Accommodations Business is discussed further in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022Total revenues increased by $312.3 million, or 41.6% as compared to the same period in 2018, driven by a 43.3% increase in our core leasing and services revenues from both organic pricing growth, and the impact of an additional 8.5 months of contribution from the ModSpace acquisition during 2019 (discussed in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements). New and rental unit sales increased 10.3% and 61.2%, respectively, also driven by acquisitions.\nOther (income) expense, net primarily consists of the non-recurring gain (loss) on disposal of non-operational property, plant and equipment, other financing related costs and other non-recurring charges.\nInterest Expense: Interest expense increased $24.1 million, or 24.5%, to $122.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $98.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in interest expense is attributable to the increased financing costs for the full year in 2019, as a result of the ModSpace acquisition which occurred in the third quarter of 2018, offset in part by the one-time bridge financing and upfront commitment fees expensed in 2018 and lower interest costs due to the redemption of our Unsecured Notes in June 2019. In the third quarter of 2018, as part of financing the ModSpace acquisition, we upsized our ABL Facility to $1.425 billion, issued the 2023 Secured Notes, and issued the Unsecured Notes and incurred bridge financing fees and upfront commitment fees of $20.5 million which were recorded to interest expense.\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nRestructuring Costs: Restructuring costs were $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The 2018 restructuring charges relate entirely to employee termination and lease breakage costs related to the Acton and ModSpace acquisitions and integrations. The 2017 restructuring charges relate to the Algeco Group corporate function and related employee termination costs.\n-Average modular space units on rent increased by 19,373 units, or 30.6%, due to the impact of an additional 8.5 months of contribution from the ModSpace acquisition.\nRevenue: Total revenue increased $305.5 million, or 68.5%, to $751.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $445.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily the result of a 73.5% increase in leasing and services revenue driven by increased volumes from acquisitions and improved pricing. Improved volumes were driven by units acquired as part of the Acton, Tyson, and ModSpace acquisitions and organic unit on rent growth, as well as increased modular delivery and installation revenues on the combined rental fleet of 72.0% due to increased transaction volumes. Average modular space monthly rental rates increased 2.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018, and average modular space units on rent increased 28,994 units, or 70.3%. Improved pricing was driven by a combination of our price optimization tools and processes, as well as by continued growth in our Ready to Work\u201d solutions and increased VAPS penetration across our customer base, offset partially by the average modular space monthly rental rates on acquired units for Acton, Tyson, and ModSpace. The increase in leasing and services revenues was further complemented by an increase of\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nInterest Expense: Interest expense decreased $20.9 million, or 17.5%, to $98.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $119.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Upon consummation of the Business Combination in November 2017, we issued the 2022 Secured Notes and entered into the ABL Facility to fund our operations as a stand-alone company. In the third quarter as part of financing the ModSpace acquisition, we upsized our ABL Facility to $1.425 billion, issued the 2023 Secured Notes, and issued the Unsecured Notes. In connection with the ModSpace acquisition, the Company incurred bridge financing fees and upfront commitment fees of $20.5 million in the third quarter, which are included in interest expense in 2018 and are not expected to reoccur.\n-On a pro forma basis, including results of WillScot and ModSpace for all periods presented, average modular space monthly rental rate increased 14.9% organically, with average modular space units on rent down 4.5% and average modular space monthly utilization up by 40 basis points ( bps\u201d) during the year to 74.2%.\n\u2022On a pro forma basis, including results of WillScot and ModSpace for all periods presented:\nThe adoption of ASC 842 at January 1, 2019, did not have a significant impact on the recognition of leasing revenue. Per the requirements of ASC 842 the Company records changes in estimated collectibility, directly against leasing revenue.\n\u2022Delivery and installation of the modular or portable storage unit;\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we consider reasonable under the circumstances, and reevaluate our estimates and judgments as appropriate. The actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity in the preparation of financial statements:\nOther Depreciation and Amortization: Other depreciation and amortization decreased $0.9 million, or 6.8%, to $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in other depreciation and amortization was driven primarily by lower depreciation as a result of the decrease in property, plant and equipment. Property, plant and equipment decreased as a result of the transfer of non-producing branches to assets held for sale which are no longer depreciated and the impact of the adoption of ASC 842 which resulted in the reversal of branch assets previously accounted for as failed sale-lease back locations which are compliant sales under ASC 842.\nIn accordance with applicable authoritative guidance, the Company accounts for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach; a more-likely-than-not recognition criterion; and a measurement approach that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If it is not more-likely-than-not that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits, no benefit is recorded. Uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold. The Company classifies interest on tax deficiencies and income tax penalties within income tax expense.\nRevenue Recognition\nGross Profit: Our gross profit percentage was 38.9% and 38.5% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our gross profit percentage, excluding the effects of depreciation (\"adjusted gross profit percentage\"), was 55.3% and 54.7% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nIn addition to focusing on GAAP measurements, we focus on Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow to measure our operating results. As such, we include in this Annual Report on Form 10-K reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations and descriptions of why we believe these measures provide useful information to investors as well as a description of the limitations of these measures are included in Item 6. Selected Financial Data.\u201d\nOther depreciation and amortization includes depreciation of our property, plant and equipment, as well as the amortization of our intangible assets.\nLease Impairment Expense and Other Related Charges: Lease impairment expense and other related charges was $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Effective January 1,2019, in connection with the adoption of ASC 842, we recorded $4.2 million in ROU asset impairments, $2.6 million in rent on closed locations and $1.9 million in lease termination fees.\nExecutive Summary\nThe Company's payment terms vary by the type and location of its customer and the product or services offered. The time between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. While the Company may bill certain customers in advance, its contracts do not contain a significant financing component based on the short length of time between upfront billings and the performance of contracted services. For certain products, services, or customer types, the Company requires payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer.\n\u2022Maintenance and other ad hoc services performed during the lease term; and\nCash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $26.1 million as compared to $1,180.0 million cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $1,206.1 million cash used. The increase in cash used by financing activities is primarily due to a reduction in borrowings, net of repayments of $1,086.0 million, a decrease in receipts from the issuance of common stock of $146.3 million primarily related to the financing of the ModSpace acquisition and an increase in debt extinguishment costs of $7.1 million. In connection with the ModSpace acquisition, in 2018 we borrowed an aggregate of $1,097.1 million related to the issuance of the 2023 Secured Notes and the Unsecured Notes, and through the up-sized ABL Facility. The 2018 stock issuance was used to finance the acquisition of ModSpace. We paid redemption premium costs of $7.1 million in 2019 as a result of the redemption of the Unsecured Notes and the $30.0 million prepayment on the 2022 Secured Notes. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by a decrease in financing fees payments of $34.0 million due to the significant fees incurred in 2018 as part of the financing activities noted above in connected with the acquisition of ModSpace.\n\u2022the average utilization rate of our modular lease units; and\nOn a pro forma basis, including results of WillScot and ModSpace for all periods presented, total revenues decreased $2.9 million, or 2.8%, year over year for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decline was driven by reduced modular delivery and installation revenues and reduced new unit sales, which declined $6.1 million, or 24.7%, and $2.2 million, or 33.7%, respectively. The decline in modular delivery and installation revenues was driven by several large projects that began or were completed during the prior year and resulted in large delivery and installation revenues. These declines were partially offset by increased rental unit sales of $4.5 million, or 56.9%. Core modular leasing revenues increased $0.8 million, or 1.3%, with increases in pro forma average modular space monthly rental rates of $25, or 4.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, being partially offset by a decrease in modular space units on rent of 2.5% on a pro forma basis to 8,973. Pro forma utilization for our modular space units decreased to 56.1%, down 30 bps from 56.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOptimizing Cash Flow through Strategic Deployment of Capital.\nAdjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA increased $12.4 million, or 64.9%, to $31.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily driven by higher modular leasing margin due to increased modular volumes and average monthly rental rates, offset by increased SG&A expense, excluding discrete items, of $4.1 million primarily related to the ModSpace acquisition. Employee costs increased $1.5 million as a result of the increased size of our workforce. Occupancy costs increased $2.8 million largely due to the expansion of our branch network and storage lots.\nAmerica, as well as a highly scalable corporate center and management information systems, which we believe positions us well to continue to acquire and integrate other companies. We may pursue acquisitions that will provide further scale efficiencies to our platform, allowing us to improve returns generated by the acquired assets.\nCurrency (Gains) Losses, Net\nComponents of Our Consolidated Historical Results of Operations\nGross Profit: Our gross profit percentage was 38.5% and 37.1% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our gross profit percentage, excluding the effects of depreciation (\"adjusted gross profit percentage\"), was 54.7% and 53.4% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nWe maintain a disciplined focus on our return on capital. As part of this discipline, we diligently consider the potential returns and opportunity costs associated with each investment we make. We continually assess both our existing lease fleet and customer demand for opportunities to deploy capital more efficiently. We manage our maintenance capital expenditures as well as growth capital expenditures to best fit the economic conditions at the time. Within our existing lease fleet, we examine the potential cash and earnings generation of an asset sale versus continuing to lease the asset. In addition, we examine the relative benefits of organic expansion opportunities versus expansion through acquisition to obtain a favorable return on capital.\nCash Flows\n-Sales revenue declined $46.9 million, or 32.1%, driven primarily by one large new sale recognized in 2018 from ModSpace related to hurricane relief in the amount of $29.0 million in our Modular - US segment.\nInterest income consists of interest on notes due from affiliates which were settled in 2017.\n$17.2 million, or 47.3% in new unit sales as compared to 2017 primarily driven by increased sales as a result of the ModSpace acquisition, which historically had higher new sales than WillScot, including a single large sale project serviced by the Modular - US segment that accounted for nearly half of the revenue variance. Rental unit sales increased $3.1 million, or 14.2% as compared to 2017.\nTotal average units on rent for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were 85,737 and 53,862, respectively. The increase was due to units acquired as part of the Acton, Tyson, and ModSpace acquisitions and organic improvements in modular space average units on rent, with modular space average units on rent increased by 28,994 units, or 70.3% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Modular space average monthly rental rates increased 2.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Portable storage average units on rent increased by 2,881 units, or 22.9% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Average portable storage monthly rental rates increased 2.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The average modular space unit utilization rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 71.6%, as compared to 70.3% during the same period in 2017. The increase in average modular space utilization rate was driven by a reduction in the combined modular space unit fleet size during the period across the WillScot, ModSpace, Acton and Tyson fleet. The average portable storage unit utilization rate during the year ended December 31, 2018 was 68.9%, as compared to 71.4% during the same period in 2017. The decrease in average portable storage utilization rate was driven by organic declines in the number of portable storage average units on rent in the Modular - US segment.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nDepreciation is generally computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, as follows:\nIncome Tax Benefit: Income tax benefit increased $37.7 million to $38.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in tax benefit was principally driven by the pre-tax loss tax benefit of $19.4 million, a tax benefit of $11.9 million, related to a reduction in the valuation allowance and a tax benefit of $7.0 million related to a change in the Company asserting indefinite re-investment in certain of its foreign businesses. In 2017, a pre-tax loss tax benefit was reduced by the impairment of Canadian Goodwill, an unfavorable permanent adjustment, with no tax basis which reduces the expected pre-tax loss benefit. In addition, as a result of the Tax Act, the Company remeasured their net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a net tax benefit of $28.1 million which was offset by a $50.5 million valuation allowance at December 22, 2017. Also, refer to Note 14 regarding the Tax Act enacted in the US on December 22, 2017 and additional components of the rate reconciliation.\n-Consolidated modular space average monthly rental rate increased to $614 representing an 11.2% increase year over year.\nIncome Taxes\nAdjusted EBITDA: Corporate and other costs and eliminations to consolidated Adjusted EBITDA increased $15.1 million or 100.0% to $0.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from a loss of $15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The 2017 costs related to the Algeco Group operations, which separated from the Company in 2017. Similar costs incurred in 2019 and 2018 by WillScot are included primarily in the Modular - US segment.\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognized for the income taxes on the undistributed earnings of wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries unless such earnings are permanently reinvested, or will only be repatriated when possible to do so at minimal additional tax cost. Current income tax relating to items recognized directly in equity is recognized in equity and not in profit (loss) for the year.\nSG&A expenses in the Modular- US and Modular - Other North America segments increased $137.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 2017. Integration costs incurred in 2018 were $30.0 million, as compared to no costs in 2017, which include discrete training costs, fleet relocation costs, branch exit costs, and professional service expenses related to the Acton and ModSpace integrations. Employee costs increased $43.4 million driven by the increased size of the workforce before realization of all expected employee savings to be achieved as a result of restructuring activities. Occupancy costs increased $13.8 million largely due to the expansion of our branch network and storage lots before expected savings are realized as we exit redundant locations. Transaction costs, excluding those in Corporate and other, increased $18.3 million primarily related to costs incurred related to the acquisition of ModSpace. Legal and professional fees increased $10.9 million over 2017 before realization of all expected cost savings and due to operating as a public company for all of 2018. The remaining increases of $21.3 million are primarily related to increased insurance, computer, marketing, office, tax and bad debt expenses related to operating a larger operation as a result of our recent acquisitions and our expanded employee base and branch network.\nCash flows from investing activities\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCurrency (gains) losses, net include unrealized and realized gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies other than our functional currency at the reporting date.\nWe are a leading provider of modular space and portable storage solutions in the US, Canada and Mexico. As of December 31, 2019, our branch network included approximately 120 locations and additional drop lots to better service our more than 50,000 customers across the US, Canada, and Mexico. We offer our customers an extensive selection of ready to work\u201d modular space and portable storage solutions with over 125,000 modular space units and over 25,000 portable storage units in our fleet. We remain focused on our core priorities of growing modular leasing revenues by increasing modular space units on rent, both organically and through our consolidation strategy, delivering Ready to Work\u201d solutions to our customers with VAPS and on continually improving the overall customer experience.\nRefer to the Recent Developments section in Part I, Item 1, Business, herein for further information about our recent warrant redemption and merger agreement.\nThe following summarizes our change in cash and cash equivalents cash flows for the periods presented:\n-Average modular space monthly rental rate increased 5.5% to $590.\nOther Matters\nCurrency (Gains) Losses, net: Currency (gains) losses, net were a $2.5 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to a $12.9 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in currency gains was primarily attributable to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on loans and borrowings and intercompany receivables and payables denominated in a currency other than the subsidiaries' functional currency. The majority of the intercompany receivables and payables contributing to these gains and losses were settled concurrently with the Business Combination.\nImpairment Losses on Long-Lived Assets\nOur selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expense includes all costs associated with our selling efforts, including marketing costs, marketing salaries and benefits, as well as commissions of sales personnel. It also includes integration and transaction costs associated with acquisitions and business combinations, our overhead costs, such as salaries of administrative and corporate personnel and the leasing of facilities we occupy. General and administrative costs in our historical results for Corporate and other relate to the Algeco Group's corporate costs incurred prior to or in connection with the Business Combination which are not anticipated to be recurring costs.\n\u2022the number of units in our modular lease fleet;\n(a) See Reconciliation of non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d in Item 6 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe table below sets forth the average number of units on rent in our modular lease fleet, the average utilization of our modular lease units, and the average monthly rental rate per unit, including VAPS:\nIncome from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company's lease arrangements typically include multiple lease and non-lease components. Examples of lease components include, but are not limited to, the lease of modular space or portable storage units, and examples of non-lease components include, but are not limited to, the delivery, installation, maintenance, and removal services commonly provided in a bundled transaction with the lease components. Arrangement consideration is allocated between lease deliverables and non-lease components based on the relative estimated selling (leasing) price of each deliverable. Estimated selling (leasing) price of the lease deliverables is based upon the estimated stand-alone selling price of the related performance obligations using an adjusted market approach.\n-Average modular space units on rent increased by 2,052 units, or 29.6%, as compared to the same period in 2018 driven primarily by acquired units from the ModSpace transaction.\nModular - Other North America Segment\nThe majority of the interest costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2017 relate to the previous debt structure of WSII as part of the Algeco Group, including $58.4 million of interest expense incurred in 2017 on notes payable to affiliates, which were settled in full in connection with the Algeco Group restructuring that occurred prior to the Business Combination. The decrease in interest expense is driven by our lower average debt and notes payable balances in 2018 under our new debt structure as compared to the Algeco Group debt structure in place in 2017, partially offset by bridge financing and upfront commitment fees of $20.5 million incurred in connection with the ModSpace acquisition and higher average debt balances subsequent to the August of 2018 ModSpace acquisition. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt, and the additional debt incurred during the third quarter as part of financing the ModSpace acquisition, which we expect will increase our interest expense in future periods.\nThe Company generally has three non-lease service-related performance obligations in its contracts with customers:\nWe estimate cost synergies of approximately $6.4 million related to the Acton and Tyson acquisitions were realized in 2018 and our integration plans remain on track. Acton sales and operations were integrated in April of 2018, and effective November 1, 2018, we began delivering all units acquired from ModSpace under a combined operating and information technology platform. Effective January 7, 2019, we completed the ModSpace system integration and all billing activities on existing ModSpace contracts are now fully integrated. Exit activities for redundant branch locations, such as preparing units and materials for transport to other locations remain on schedule. These activities are expected to continue through 2019 and we expect over $60.0 million of annual reoccurring cost savings as we execute the established integration plans for Acton and ModSpace.\n-Modular space average monthly rental rate of $617 increased 12.0% year over year including the dilutive impacts of acquisitions. Improved pricing was driven by a combination of our price optimization tools and processes, as well as by continued growth in our \"Ready to Work\" solutions and increased VAPS penetration across our customer base.\nWe account for acquisitions of businesses under the acquisition method. Under the acquisition method of accounting, we record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair value on the date of acquisition. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable net assets. Estimated fair values of acquired assets and liabilities are provisional and could change as additional information is received. Valuations are finalized as soon as practicable, but not later than one year from the acquisition date. Any subsequent changes to purchase price allocations result in a corresponding adjustment to goodwill.\nRevenue is recognized net of taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\nLease impairment expense and other related charges include impairment of right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets under ASC 842, gain or loss on the exit of a leased property generally associated with lease termination payments and rent expense for locations which have been closed but have not been abandoned or impaired.\nInterest Income\nIncome Tax Benefit\nImpairment Losses on Goodwill\nGross Profit: Gross profit increased $110.5 million, or 41.8%, to $374.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $264.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in gross profit was driven by higher revenues driven both by the ModSpace acquisition and by organic growth. The increase in gross profit from higher revenues was partially offset by a $50.0 million, or 47.0% increase in depreciation of rental equipment for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily related to units acquired in the ModSpace acquisition, and as a result of continued capital investment in our fleet.\nCash flows from financing activities\nSG&A Expense: SG&A expense increased $16.1 million, or 6.3%, to $271.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $254.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Employee costs increased $19.5 million driven by the increased size of the workforce, offset partially by employee savings achieved as a result of restructuring activities; and occupancy costs increased $10.3 million largely due to the expansion of our branch network and storage lots, including a portion of the expected cost savings as we have now exited approximately 85% of redundant real estate locations.\nGross Profit: The Corporate and other adjustments to revenue and gross profit pertain to the elimination of intercompany leasing transactions between the Modular business segments and the legacy Remote Accommodations Business segment, which was carved out in 2017 and is reflected as discontinued operations in our financial statements.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nContractual Obligations\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help the reader understand WillScot, our operations and our present business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto, contained in Item 8 of this report. As a result of the Business Combination, (i) WillScot's consolidated financial results for periods prior to November 29, 2017 reflect the financial results of WSII and its consolidated subsidiaries, as the accounting predecessor to WillScot, and (ii) for periods from and after this date, WillScot's financial results reflect those of WillScot and its consolidated subsidiaries (including WSII and its subsidiaries) as the successor following the Business Combination. We use certain non-GAAP financial information that we believe is important for purposes of comparison to prior periods and development of future projections and earnings growth prospects. This information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are provided where presented.\nOur liquidity as of December 31, 2019 consisted of cash and cash equivalents and unused commitments under our ABL Facility which is discussed below. Our practice is to maintain sufficient liquidity through cash from operations and our ABL Facility, to mitigate the impacts of any adverse financial market conditions on our operations. We believe that cash generated\nThe key drivers of changes in our leasing revenue are:\nConsideration is allocated to each of these performance obligations within the contract based upon their estimated relative standalone selling prices using the estimated cost plus a margin approach. Revenue from these activities is recognized as the services are performed.\nOur Business and Growth Strategies\nGenerating Additional Cash Flow Through Operational Efficiencies and Cost Reductions.\nBusiness Segment Results\nServices Revenue\nOther (Income) Expense, Net\nGross Profit: Gross profit increased $7.6 million, or 43.4%, to $25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $17.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The effects of favorable foreign currency movements increased gross profit by $0.6 million, as the Canadian Dollar and Mexican Peso strengthened against the US dollar during the year. The increase in gross profit, excluding the effects of foreign currency, was driven by higher revenues as a result of the ModSpace acquisition and organic growth. The increase in gross profit from higher revenues was partially offset by a $2.8 million, or 22.8% increase in depreciation of rental equipment for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily related to acquired units in ModSpace acquisition.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $1.6 billion of total nominal indebtedness outstanding. A substantial portion of our liquidity needs arise from debt service on our indebtedness and from the funding of our costs of operations and capital expenditures.\nThe Company performs its annual impairment test of goodwill as of October 1 at the reporting unit level, as well as during any reporting period in which events or changes in circumstances that, in management's judgment, may constitute triggering events under ASC 350-20, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, Testing Goodwill for Impairment. The Company uses an independent valuation specialist for its annual impairment tests to assist in the valuation.\n\nWe combine product quality and availability, the largest service network in North America, an industry-leading offering of VAPS and a commitment to customer service to provide increased value to our customers. This attracts new customers, increases customer retention and increases our margins. We intend to grow the business by continuing to improve the quality, delivery and service of our products and by continuing to introduce new and innovative products and services that complement our core offering to the most attractive industry and geographic end markets.\n\u2022Generated Free Cash Flow of $20.0 million in 2019, as net cash provided by operating activities of $172.6 million after funding $26.6 million of integration costs was reinvested primarily in value added products and fleet refurbishments to support growth of modular leasing revenues (net cash used in investing activities of $152.6 million) and to pay down debt $16.5 million.\n(a) Long-term indebtedness includes borrowings and interest under the ABL Facility and the Senior Secured Notes.\nIn addition to leasing revenue, we also generate revenue from sales of new and used modular space and portable storage units to our customers, as well as delivery, installation, maintenance, removal services and other incidental items related to accommodations services for our customers. Included in our sales revenue are charges for modifying or customizing sales equipment to customers' specifications.\nWe have implemented a number of management initiatives designed to improve operations and increase profitability, efficiency and operating leverage. We continually assess our branch operating footprint, our vendor base, and our operating structure to maximize revenue generation while minimizing costs. The acquisitions of Acton and ModSpace provided us with increased scale that allowed us to reduce from over 200 combined operating locations to approximately 120 operating locations by the end of 2019. With this post-acquisition scale, we expect to extract over $60.0 million of redundant costs from the combined businesses. As of December 31, 2019, we estimate that we have realized over $40 million of cumulative savings related to the Acton and ModSpace acquisitions and subsequent integrations. We have a proven track record of efficiently integrating acquisitions and quickly eliminating operational redundancies, while maintaining acquired customer relationships.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nWe recognize goodwill impairment charges associated with our reporting units when the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit.\nLeasing Revenue\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nOther Depreciation and Amortization\n-Modular leasing revenues increased $53.4 million, or 7.7%, driven by a 13.7% year over year increase in modular space average monthly rental rates as a result of our price optimization tools and processes, as well as by continued growth in our Ready to Work\u201d solutions and increased VAPS penetration across our customer base.\nRestructuring Costs: Restructuring costs were $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The 2019 restructuring charges related primarily to employee termination costs as a result of the ModSpace acquisition and integration. The 2018 restructuring charges are comprised of employee termination and lease breakage costs related to the Acton and ModSpace acquisitions and integrations. Prior to the adoption of ASC 842 effective January 1. 2019, the costs associated with leases exited as a result of a restructuring plan were recorded in restructuring expense.\nWe are continuously working to increase the utilization and yield of our lease fleet by improving the efficiency and performance of our sales force, expanding penetration of VAPS and enhancing our management information systems. Effective use of real-time information allows us to monitor and optimize the utilization of our fleet, allocate our fleet to the highest demand markets, optimize pricing and determine the best allocation of our capital to invest in fleet and branches as well as to identify opportunities where underutilized lease fleet can be sold to generate cash.\nModular - US Segment\nYears Ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017\nOn a pro forma basis, including results of WillScot and ModSpace for all periods presented, total revenues decreased $0.4 million, or 0.0%, year-over-year for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decline was driven by reduced new sales, which declined $41.6 million, or 41.3%, as a result of one large sale recognized in 2018 in the amount of $29.0 million in our Modular - US segment, and decreased rental unit sales, which declined $5.3 million, or 11.7%. The declines in sales volumes were nearly offset by an increase in our core modular leasing revenues, which increased $53.4 million, or 7.7%, as a result of a 13.7% increase in average modular space monthly rental rates.\nThe Company's non-lease revenues do not include material amounts of variable consideration, other than the variability noted for services arrangements expected to be performed beyond a twelve month period.\nImpairment losses on Long-Lived Assets: Impairment losses on long-lived assets were $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $0.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we reclassified certain branch facilities that we intend to exit from property, plant and equipment to held for sale and recognized an impairment on these assets as the estimated fair value was less than the carrying value of the facilities.\n\u2022Generated Adjusted EBITDA of $356.5 million in 2019, representing an increase of $141.0 million or 65.4% as compared to the same period in 2018, which includes the impact of an additional 8.5 months of contribution from the ModSpace acquisition in 2019, as well as continued realization of commercial and cost synergies associated with the ModSpace and Acton acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA for the Modular - US segment and the Modular - Other North America segment, respectively, was $325.0 million and $31.5 million in 2019.\nCapital Expenditures: Capital expenditures for rental equipment increased $3.7 million, or 63.8%, to $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was driven by increased spend for new units, VAPS, and refurbishments as a result of the increased fleet size due to the ModSpace acquisition. During the year, our modular space unit fleet grew by over 65%.\nAdjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA increased $6.0 million, or 45.8%, to $19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $13.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily driven by higher modular leasing margin due to increased modular volumes and average monthly rental rates, offset by increased SG&A expense, excluding discrete items, of $4.3 million primarily related to the ModSpace acquisition during the year. Employee costs increased $2.0 million as a result of the increased size of the workforce and before realization of all expected employee savings as a result of the restructuring to capture operating synergies as a result of integrating these businesses into WillScot. Occupancy costs increased $1.0 million largely due to the expansion of our branch network and storage lots before expected savings are realized as we exit redundant locations. The remaining increases of $1.2 million are primarily related to increased insurance, computer, marketing, office, tax and bad debt expenses related to operating a larger operation as a result of our recent acquisition and our expanded employee base and branch network.\n-Total revenues decreased $0.4 million, as the impact of non-recurring sales in the prior year were nearly offset by continued strong organic growth in our core leasing revenues.\n\u2022the average monthly rental rate per unit, including VAPS.\n-Consolidated average modular space units on rent increased 21,425, or 30.5%, year over year, driven by an additional 8.5 months of contribution from the ModSpace acquisition, and average modular space utilization increased 40 basis points ( bps\u201d) year over year to 72.0%.\nWillScot is a holding company that derives all of its operating cash flow from its operating subsidiaries. Our principal sources of liquidity include cash generated by operating activities from our subsidiaries, credit facilities, and sales of equity and debt securities.\nOther (Income) Expense, Net: Other expense, net was $4.6 million of other income for the year ended December 31, 2018 and $2.8 million of other expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in other income was driven by the receipt of insurance proceeds related to assets damaged during Hurricane Harvey which contributed $4.8 million and other settlements which contributed $0.8 million to other (income) expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nImpairment losses on Long-Lived Assets: Impairment losses on long-lived assets were $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. In 2019 and 2018, we reclassified certain branch facilities from property, plant and equipment to assets held for sale and recognized an impairment on these assets as the estimated fair value was less than the carrying value of the facilities.\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $1,180.0 million as compared to $396.8 million cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $783.2 million. The increase is primarily driven by a $1,093.2 million increase in borrowings net of repayments and a $123.9 million decrease in net repayments on notes due to affiliates. In order to finance the cash consideration for the acquisition of ModSpace in the third quarter of 2018, we issued $300.0 million of 2023 Secured Notes, issued $200.0 million of Unsecured Notes, and borrowed an additional $597.1 million on the up-sized ABL Facility, which drove the overall increase in borrowings, net of repayments. In 2017, in connection with the Business Combination, the obligations under the notes due to affiliates were settled and there was no activity related to these notes in 2018. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by a $424.6 million decrease in cash receipts from the issuance of common stock. We had cash receipts of $147.2 million and $571.8 million from the issuance of common stock during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The 2018 stock issuance was used to finance the acquisition of ModSpace and the 2017 stock issuance was made in connection with the Business Combination.\nRecent Developments\nCapital Expenditures: Capital expenditures for rental equipment increased $42.0 million, or 27.7%, to $193.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $151.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Net capital expenditures also increased $24.4 million, or 19.0%, to $152.5 million. The increases for both were driven by increased spend for refurbishments and VAPS to drive revenue growth and for maintenance of a larger fleet following our recent acquisitions.\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.\nThe US market for modular space and portable storage solutions is fragmented, with approximately 60% of the modular space market supplied by regional and local competitors. We have a broad network of operating branches in North\nLeveraging Scale via Acquisitions.\nDiscrete items included in SG&A decreased for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, by $17.7 million as decreases in transaction and integration costs related to the ModSpace and Acton acquisitions and subsequent integrations of $20.1 million and $4.0 million, respectively, were partially offset by increases in stock compensation expense and other acquisition-related activities of $3.3 million and $3.1 million, respectively.\nGross profit increased $123.8 million, or 74.8%, to $289.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $165.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in gross profit is a result of a $285.1 million increase in modular leasing and services revenue and increased new unit sales gross profit of $6.3 million, offset by increases of $118.0 million in modular leasing and services costs. Increases in modular leasing and services revenues and costs were primarily as a result of increased revenues due to additional units on rent as a result of recent acquisitions as well as increased margins due to favorable average monthly rental rates on modular space units. These increases were partially offset by increased depreciation of $48.8 million as a result of additional rental equipment acquired as part of the Acton, Tyson, and ModSpace acquisitions, as well as continued capital investment in our existing rental equipment.\nThe following tables and discussion summarize our reportable segment financial information for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Consistent with the presentation of our financial statements, the below segment results only include results from Acton, Tyson, and ModSpace for the periods subsequent to the respective acquisition dates and do not include any unrealized incremental cost savings, revenue growth, or pro forma adjustments that management expects to result from the integrations of the acquired businesses. Future changes to our organizational structure may result in changes to the segments disclosed.\nRevenue\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $1,217.2 million as compared to $392.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $824.5 million. This increase was principally the result of an increase in cash used of $846.0 million for the acquisition of businesses and an increase in cash used of $49.2 million for the purchase of rental equipment. In 2018, we acquired ModSpace and Tyson for combined cash consideration of $1,083.1 million compared to the acquisition of Acton in 2017 for cash consideration of $237.1 million. We incurred capital expenditures for the purchase of rental equipment of $160.9 million and $111.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures was driven primarily by strategic investment in refurbishment of existing fleet, purchase of VAPS, and new fleet purchases to maintain and grow units on rent. The increase in cash used in investing activities was partially offset by a $67.8 million decrease in cash used in lending activities to affiliates. In 2018, we did not engage in any lending activities as the notes due from affiliates were settled as part of the Business Combination in 2017.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the US, Canada and Mexico. Our overall effective tax rate is affected by a number of factors, such as the relative amounts of income we earn in differing tax jurisdictions, state and jurisdictional law changes, and certain non-deductible expenses such as compensation disallowance. The rate is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year, such as state legislation enactments. These discrete items may not be consistent from year to year. Income tax expense (benefit), deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nCash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $172.6 million as compared to $37.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $135.5 million. This increase was primarily due to a $159.1 million increase in net income, adjusted for non-cash items, in 2019 as compared to 2018, as a result of the impact of the ModSpace acquisition on operations, which is reflected in our results for all of 2019, but is only included for four and a half months in 2018. This increase in net income, adjusted for non-cash items, was partially offset by a decrease of $23.7 million in the net movements of the operating assets and liabilities. The decrease in operating assets and liabilities was attributable to an increase in trade receivables and an increase in cash interest payments during the year ended December 31, 2019, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.\nCapital Expenditures: Capital expenditures for rental equipment increased $2.2 million, or 23.2%, to $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was driven by increased spend for new fleet and VAPS to drive revenue growth and for maintenance of a larger fleet following the ModSpace acquisition. Net capital expenditures decreased $5.9 million, or 98.2%, to $0.1 million, as a result of increased rental unit sales in the period.\nWe define gross profit as the difference between total revenue and cost of revenue. Cost of revenues associated with our leasing business includes payroll and payroll-related costs for branch personnel, material and other costs related to the repair, maintenance, storage and transportation of rental equipment. Cost of revenue also includes depreciation expense associated with our rental equipment. Cost of revenues associated with our new unit sales business includes the cost to purchase, assemble, transport and customize units that are sold. Cost of revenues for our rental unit sales consist primarily of the net book value of the unit at date of sale.\nGross Profit\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, key drivers of financial performance included:\n-Average modular space monthly utilization increased 50 basis points ( bps\u201d) to 74.2% in 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018. This increase was driven primarily by de-fleeting activities associated with our integration efforts during year.\nThe following table presents information relating to our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2019:\nCash Flows from operating activities\nTrade Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWhen leases and services are billed in advance, recognition of revenue is deferred until services are rendered. If equipment is returned prior to the contractually obligated period, the excess, if any, between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay over the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date is recognized as incremental revenue upon return.\nGross Profit: Gross profit increased $13.4 million, or 53.4%, to $38.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The effects of favorable foreign currency movements increased gross profit by $0.3 million, as the Canadian Dollar and Mexican Peso strengthened against the US dollar during the year. The increase in gross profit, excluding the effects of foreign currency, was driven by higher revenues as a result of the ModSpace acquisition and organic growth. The increase in gross profit from higher revenues was partially offset by a $3.1 million, or 20.5%, increase in depreciation of rental equipment for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily related to units acquired in the ModSpace acquisition.\nITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe majority of revenue is generated by rental income subject to the guidance of ASC 840, Leases (\"ASC 840\") in 2017 and 2018 and ASC 842 in 2019. The remaining revenue is generated by performance obligations in contracts with customers for services or sale of units subject to the guidance in ASC 605, Revenue (\"ASC 605\"), in 2017 and 2018 and ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (\"ASC 606\") in 2019.\nCorporate and Other for the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nBorrowing Capacity and Availability\nModular Leasing and Services Revenue\nInterest Income: Interest income decreased $12.2 million, or 100.0%, to $0.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease is due to the decrease in the principal balance of notes due from affiliates, which were settled upon consummation of the Business Combination in November 2017.\nRevenue: Total revenue increased $284.1 million, or 41.9%, to $961.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $677.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Modular leasing revenue increased $208.2 million, or 44.4%, driven by improved volumes and pricing. Average modular space units on rent increased 19,373 units, or 30.6%, to 82,709 units on rent and resulting modular space utilization increased by 50 bps. Average modular space monthly rental rates in the Modular - US segment increased 12.0% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $617. Improved volumes were driven by units acquired as part of the ModSpace acquisition, as well as increased modular delivery and installation revenues, which increased $63.2 million, or 45.7%, due to the increased delivery volumes as compared to 2018. Improved pricing was driven by a combination of our price optimization tools and processes, as well as by continued growth in our Ready to Work\u201d solutions and increased VAPS penetration across our customer base, offset partially by the average modular space monthly rental rates on acquired units. New unit sales revenue increased $5.9 million, or 12.0%, in 2019 and rental unit sales revenue increased $6.8 million, or 32.2%. Increases for both new unit sales and rental unit sales were a result of the ModSpace acquisition and our larger post-acquisition fleet size.\nExpanding our Ready to Work\u201d Value Proposition.\nThese cost synergies are consistent with our integration plans and we expect to achieve annual recurring cost savings of over $70.0 million once our integration plans are fully executed and in our annual results.\nOn a pro forma basis, including results of WillScot and ModSpace for all periods presented, total revenues increased $2.4 million, or 0.2%, year over year for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was driven by modular leasing revenue, which increased $52.8 million, or 8.4%, driven primarily by continued pricing improvement, with increases in pro forma average modular space monthly rental rates of $80, or 14.9%, year over year for the year ended December 31, 2019. Offset by a decline in new sales, which decreased $39.5 million, or 41.9% driven primarily by one large sale recognized in 2018 in the amount of $29.0 million, and decreased rental unit sales, which declined $9.9 million, or 26.2%. Modular space units on rent decreased 4.5% on a pro forma basis to 82,709 and pro forma utilization for our modular space units increased to 74.2% up 40 bps from 73.8% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSales revenue is generated by the sale of new and rental units. Revenue from the sale of new and rental units is generally recognized at a point in time upon the transfer of control to the customer, which occurs when the unit is delivered and installed in accordance with the contract. Sales transactions constitute a single performance obligation.\nThe Company records deferred tax assets to the extent it believes that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized. In making such determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent results of operations. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized.\nCurrency (Gains) Losses, net: Currency (gains) losses, net were a $0.7 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a $2.5 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in currency losses was primarily attributable to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on loans and borrowings and intercompany receivables and payables denominated in a currency other than the subsidiaries' functional currency.\nThe remaining increases of $4.0 million are primarily related to increased professional fees, insurance, computer, travel, office and other expenses related to operating a larger business as a result of our recent acquisitions and our expanded employee base and branch network.", "item_7_text": "Restructuring Costs\n-Average modular space monthly utilization decreased by 70 bps to 56.1% in 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018.\nRestructuring costs include charges associated with exit or disposal activities that meet the definition of restructuring under Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") ASC Topic 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations ( ASC 420\u201d). Our restructuring plans are generally country or region specific and are typically completed within a one year period. Prior to the adoption of ASC 842 effective January 1, 2019, restructuring costs incurred under these plans included (i) one-time termination benefits related to employee separations, (ii) contract termination costs and, (iii) other related costs associated with exit or disposal activities including, but not limited to, costs for consolidating or closing facilities. After the adoption of ASC 842, restructuring costs include one-time termination benefits related to employee separation costs. The restructuring costs incurred in 2019 and 2018 primarily relate to the integration of our acquisitions. Costs related to the integration of acquired businesses that do not meet the definition of restructuring under ASC 420, such as employee training costs, duplicate facility costs, and professional services expenses, are included within SG&A expenses.\n-On a pro forma basis, including results of WillScot and ModSpace for all periods presented, Modular - Other North America segment modular space monthly rental rate increased 4.4%, with modular space units on rent down 2.5%, and average modular space monthly utilization down by 30 bps during the year to 56.1%.\nSales Revenue\n\nThe Corporate and other segment was discontinued in 2017.\nOur consolidated statements of net loss for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 are presented below. The below results only include results from ModSpace and Acton for the periods subsequent to their acquisition dates and does not include any incremental unrealized cost savings, revenue growth, or pro forma adjustments that management expects to result from the integration of the acquired business.\nCash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $37.1 million as compared to cash used in operating activities of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $38.5 million. This was primarily due to a $30.1 million increase of net income, adjusted for non-cash items, during 2018 as compared to 2017 due to the impact of the Acton, Tyson, and ModSpace acquisitions on revenue and gross profit. An $8.5 million increase in the net movements of the operating assets and liabilities also contributed to the overall increase in cash provided by operating activities. This increase was driven by lower interest payments in 2018 compared to 2017, offset partially by higher use of cash\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nPurchase Accounting\nTotal average units on rent for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were 108,560 and 85,737, respectively. The increase was due to units acquired as part of the ModSpace acquisition, with modular space average units on rent increased by 21,425 units, or 30.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2019. Modular space average monthly rental rates increased 11.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Portable storage average units on rent increased by 1,398 units, or 9.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2019. Average portable storage monthly rental rates increased 0.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The average modular space unit utilization rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 72.0%, as compared to 71.6% in 2018. The increase in average modular space utilization rate was driven by a reduction in the combined modular space unit fleet size across the combined WillScot and ModSpace fleet in 2019. The average portable storage unit utilization rate during the year ended December 31, 2019 was 65.8%, as compared to 68.9% in 2018. The decrease in average portable storage utilization rate was driven by organic declines in the number of portable storage average units on rent in the Modular - US segment.\n2019 was a transformational year for WillScot as we completed our integration of ModSpace and realized significant cost synergies from both the ModSpace and Acton strategic transactions. Over the past two years, we have consolidated over 200 combined operating locations into approximately 120 operating locations. We will continue the last remaining integration efforts around real estate consolidation and fleet relocation over the first half of 2020. These acquisitions coupled with WillScot's innovative \"Ready to Work\" solutions and commitment to customer service have solidified WillScot's position as the industry market leader in the modular space and portable storage solutions markets.\nBorrowing availability under the ABL Facility is equal to the lesser of $1.425 billion and the applicable borrowing bases (the Line Cap\u201d). The borrowing bases are a function of, among other things, the value of the assets in the relevant collateral pool. At December 31, 2019, the Line Cap was $1.425 billion and we had $509.1 million of available borrowing capacity under the ABL Facility.\nInterest Expense\nLease Impairment Expense and Other Related Charges\n\u2022On a pro forma basis, including the results of WillScot and ModSpace for all periods presented, Adjusted EBITDA in 2019 of $356.5 million represents an increase of $72.0 million, or 25.3% organically from $284.5 million in 2018. These pro forma results include realized cost savings from the ModSpace and Acton acquisitions, and incremental revenue growth from increased penetration of \"Ready to Work\" solutions across the combined portfolio, but do not include any additional cost savings that management expects to realize in future years.\nWe intend to maintain a leading market position and increase our revenue and profitability by pursuing the following strategies:\nRental equipment is leased primarily under operating leases and, from time to time, under sales-type lease arrangements. Operating lease minimum contractual terms generally range from 1 month to 60 months and averaged approximately 12 months across the Company's rental fleet for the year ended December 31, 2019. There were no material sales-type lease arrangements as of December 31, 2019.\nOur revenue consists mainly of leasing, services and sales revenue. We derive our leasing and services revenue primarily from the leasing of modular space and portable storage units. Included in modular leasing revenue are VAPS, such as rentals of steps, ramps, furniture, air conditioners, wireless internet access points, damage waivers and service plans. Modular delivery and installation revenue includes fees that we charge for the delivery, setup, knockdown and pick-up of leasing equipment to and from customers' premises and repositioning leasing equipment.\nOverview\nAdjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA increased $85.6 million, or 77.3%, to $196.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $110.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was driven by higher revenues and gross profits discussed above excluding depreciation, partially offset by increases in SG&A, excluding discrete items, of $81.5 million primarily related to the acquisitions of Acton and ModSpace during the year. Employee costs increased $37.9 million driven by the increased size of the workforce before realization of all expected employee savings to be achieved as a result of the restructuring activities. Occupancy costs increased $12.7 million largely due to the expansion of our branch network and storage lots before expected savings are realized as we exit redundant locations. Legal and professional fees increased $11.0 million over 2017 before realization of all expected cost savings and due to operating as a public company for all of 2018. The remaining increases of $19.9 million are primarily related to increased insurance, computer, marketing, office, tax and bad debt expenses related to operating a larger operation as a result of our recent acquisitions and our expanded employee base and branch network.\nFor acquired businesses, the Company records assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the respective acquisition dates. Based on these values, the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Generally, reporting units are one level below the operating segment (the component level), if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is assigned to each of the Company's reporting units that are expected to benefit from the combination.\nRevenue: Total revenue increased $20.1 million, or 37.4%, to $73.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $53.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Modular leasing revenue increased $14.8 million, or 43.4%, which is primarily attributable driven by improved volumes and pricing. Average modular space units on rent increased by 1,824 units, or 35.8% to 6,921 units on rent, and average modular space monthly rental rates in the Modular - Other North America segment increased 5.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $559. Improved volumes were driven by units acquired as part of the ModSpace acquisition, as well as increased modular delivery and installation revenues, which increased $7.6 million, or 86.4%, due to increased transaction volumes as a result of the combined company. Improved pricing was driven by a combination of our price optimization tools and processes, as well as by continued growth in our Ready to Work\u201d solutions and increased VAPS penetration across our customer base, as well as by the average modular space monthly rental rates on acquired units. New unit sales revenue decreased $2.5 million, or 35.2%, associated with decreased sale opportunities. Rental unit sales revenue increased $0.2 million, or 5.4%.\n\u2022Modular - Other North America segment which represents 9.6% of revenues in 2019, increased by $28.1 million, or 38.1% as compared to the same period in 2018. Increases were driven primarily by:\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $152.6 million as compared to $1,217.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $1,064.6 million. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was driven by a $1,083.1 million decrease in cash used for business acquisitions, an $11.3 million increase in proceeds from the sale of rental equipment, and an $18.1 million increase in proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment. The decrease in cash used in business acquisitions was due to the acquisition of ModSpace during the year ended December 31, 2018, with no business acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2019. Proceeds from the sale of rental equipment increased due to increased sales volume as a result of the acquisition of ModSpace. Proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment increased primarily as a result of the sale of non-operating branch locations during the year ended December 31, 2019, as part of the ongoing integration and consolidation process following the acquisition of ModSpace. The overall decrease in cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures of $44.2 million in 2019, which was primarily driven by increased refurbishments of existing fleet, following our recent acquisitions, and purchases of VAPS to drive revenue growth.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOther Income, Net: Other income, net was $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in other income was driven by the receipt of insurance proceeds related to assets damaged during Hurricane Harvey and other settlements which contributed $5.6 million to other expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2018, offset by the receipt of $2.4 million in insurance proceeds related to assets damaged during hurricanes and the receipt of a $0.9 million settlement during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nGoodwill and Goodwill Impairment\nIncreasing the Utilization and Yield of our Rental Equipment.\nCapital Expenditures: Capital expenditures for rental equipment increased $55.0 million, or 57.1%, to $151.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $96.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increases for both were driven by increased spend for new units, VAPS, and refurbishments as a result of the increased fleet size due to the Acton, Tyson and ModSpace acquisitions. During the year, our modular space unit fleet grew by nearly 125%, and our average modular space unit fleet grew over 70% in 2018 as compared to 2017.\nRevenue: Total revenue increased $284.7 million, or 72.5%, to $677.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $392.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Modular leasing revenue increased $205.0 million, or 77.6%, driven by improved volumes and pricing. Average modular space units on rent increased 27,170 units, or 75.1% to 63,336 units on rent and resulting modular space utilization decreased by 20 bps. Average modular space monthly rental rates in the Modular - US segment increased 2.4% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $551. Improved volumes were driven by units acquired as part of the Acton, Tyson, and ModSpace acquisitions, as well as increased modular delivery and installation revenues, which increased $57.2 million, or 70.6%, due to the increased delivery volumes as compared to 2017. Improved pricing was driven by a combination of our price optimization tools and processes, as well as by continued growth in our Ready to Work\u201d solutions and increased VAPS penetration across our customer base, offset partially by the average modular space monthly rental rates on acquired units. New unit sales revenue increased $19.7 million, or 67.2%, nearly half of which was driven by a single large sale project. Rental unit sales revenue increased $2.8 million, or 15.3%, primarily a result of the ModSpace acquisition and our larger post-acquisition fleet size.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\n\nWe estimate incremental cost synergies of approximately $36.0 million related to the ModSpace and Acton acquisitions were realized in 2019, which compares to approximately $6.4 million of synergies realized in 2018 related to the Acton and Onsite Space LLC (d/b/a Tyson Onsite ( Tyson\u201d) acquisitions, bringing cumulative synergies related to the Acton, Tyson, and ModSpace acquisitions from the dates of the acquisitions to December 31, 2019 to approximately $42.4 million.\n\n\u2022Modular - US segment revenues, which represented 90.4% of revenues in 2019, increased by $284.1 million, or 41.9%, as compared to 2018, through:\nWe may from time to time seek to retire our securities for cash or other consideration in open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions, exchange offers or otherwise. Additionally, we may pursue additional strategic acquisitions. Any such transactions will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.\nto pay down accounts payable and accrued liabilities, both associated with transaction expenses incurred for the Business Combination as well as normal operating liabilities.\nSee Note 12 in Part II, Item 8, herein for further discussion of WillScot's indebtedness.\nInterest expense consists of the costs of external debt including the Company's ABL credit agreement (the \"ABL Facility\"), the senior secured notes due December 15, 2022 (the \"2022 Secured Notes) and the senior secured notes due August 15, 2023 (the \"2023 Secured Notes, together with the 2022 Secured Notes, the \"Senior Secured Notes\"), the senior unsecured notes due November 15, 2023 (the \"Unsecured Notes\"), and prior to the Business Combination, interest due on amounts owed to affiliates and interest on the revolving credit facility associated with the Algeco Group.\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, value of net operating losses, future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. Management bases fair value estimates on assumptions it believes to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from these estimates.\nBusiness Environment and Outlook\nOther Depreciation and Amortization: Other depreciation and amortization increased $4.6 million, or 52.9%, to $13.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, compared to $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was driven primarily by depreciation on property, plant and equipment acquired as part of the Acton and ModSpace acquisitions in December of 2017 and August of 2018, respectively.\nTrade receivables primarily consist of amounts due from customers from the lease or sale of rental equipment and their delivery and installation. Trade accounts receivable are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon the amount of losses expected to be incurred in the collection of these accounts. These estimated losses are calculated using the loss rate method based upon a review of outstanding receivables, related aging, including specific accounts if deemed necessary and on historical collection experience. In accordance with the adoption of ASC 842, effective January 1, 2019, specifically identifiable operating lease receivables not deemed probable of collection are recorded as a reduction of revenue. The remaining provision for doubtful accounts is recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the entire provision for doubtful accounts is recorded as a selling, general and administrative expense. The Company reviews the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 and December 31, 2018 and 2017\n(b) Includes the obligations under our interest rate swap agreement that effectively convert $400.0 million in aggregate notional amount of variable-rate debt under the Company's ABL Facility into fixed-rate debt. The future obligations under the interest rate swaps was calculated using the 1-month LIBOR rate as of December 31, 2019.\nSignificant factors driving our liquidity include cash flows generated from operating activities and capital expenditures for rental equipment. With the exception of 2017 when we incurred significant discrete costs related to the Business Combination, we historically have generated and expect to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations.\nRental equipment is comprised of modular space and portable storage units held for rent or on rent to customers and VAPS which are in use or available to be used by customers. Rental equipment is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Costs of improvements and betterments to rental equipment are capitalized when such costs extend the useful life of the equipment or increase the rental value of the unit. Costs incurred for equipment to meet a particular customer specification are capitalized and depreciated over the lease term taking in consideration the residual value of the asset. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.\n\u2022Removal services that occur at the end of the lease term.\nOur customers operate in a diversified set of end markets, including commercial and industrial, construction, education, energy and natural resources, government and other end markets. We track several market leading indicators including those related to our two largest end markets, the commercial and industrial segment and the construction segment, which collectively accounted for approximately 80% of our revenues in the year ended December 31, 2019. Market fundamentals underlying these markets are currently stable, and we expect continued modest market growth in the next several years. Current conditions, and potential growth drivers such as a robust U.S. economy, increased infrastructure spending, and continued penetration of our customer base with our VAPS offering provide us confidence in continued demand for our products.\nWe recognize property, plant, and equipment impairment charges when the carrying value of assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets.\nOur principal line of business is modular leasing and sales. The Company formerly operated a remote accommodations business (the \"Remote Accommodations Business\"), which consisted of Target Logistics Management LLC and its subsidiaries and Chard Camp Catering Services, that was carved out in connection with the Business Combination and was no longer a part of our business as of December 31, 2017. The Remote Accommodations Business was considered a single reportable segment. Modular leasing and sales comprises two reportable segments: Modular - US and Modular - Other North America. The Modular - US reportable segment includes the contiguous 48 states and Hawaii, and the Modular - Other North America reportable segment includes Alaska, Canada and Mexico.\n-Modular space units on rent decreased 4.3% year over year, and utilization increased 30 bps.\nAdjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA increased $128.6 million, or 65.5%, to $325.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $196.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was driven by higher revenues and gross profits discussed above excluding depreciation, partially offset by increases in SG&A, excluding discrete items and other items, of $29.7 million. Discrete and other items within SG&A decreased for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, by $19.8 million as decreases in transaction costs and integration costs related to the ModSpace and Acton acquisitions and subsequent integrations of $19.8 million and $6.3 million, respectively, were partially offset by increases in stock compensation expense and other acquisition-related activities of $3.2 million and a $3.1 million, respectively. Increases in SG&A, excluding discrete items, primarily related to increased employee costs of $18.1 million driven by the increased size of the workforce offset partially by employee savings achieved as a result of restructuring activities; and occupancy costs increased $7.5 million largely due to the expansion of our branch network and storage lots, including a portion of the expected cost saving as we have exited redundant locations. The remaining increases in SG&A of $4.2 million were primarily related to increased insurance, computer, marketing, office, and tax expenses related to operating a larger operation as a result of our recent acquisitions and our expanded employee base and branch network.\nIncome Tax Benefit: Income tax benefit decreased $36.4 million to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $38.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in tax benefit was driven by the lower loss before income tax for the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately $17.0 million less tax benefit, and discrete tax benefits in 2018 related to a reduction in the valuation allowance, tax benefit of $11.9 million, and a tax benefit of $7.0 million related to a change in the Company asserting indefinite re-investment in certain of its foreign businesses.\nGross profit increased $123.9 million, or 42.8%, to $413.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $289.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in gross profit is a result of a $291.5 million increase in modular leasing and services revenue and increased new unit sales gross profit of $0.2 million, offset by increases of $120.2 million in modular leasing and services costs. Increases in modular leasing and services revenues and costs were primarily as a result of increased revenues due to additional units on rent as a result of recent acquisitions as well as increased margins due to favorable average monthly rental rates on modular space units and increased delivery and installation margins driven primarily by higher pricing per transaction. These increases were partially offset by increased depreciation of $53.3 million as a result of additional rental equipment acquired as part of the ModSpace acquisition, as well as continued capital investment in our existing rental equipment.\n\n\nThe Company assesses the likelihood that each of the deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent management believes realization of any deferred tax assets is not likely, the Company establishes a valuation allowance. When a valuation allowance is established or there is an increase in an allowance in a reporting period, tax expense is generally recorded in the Company's consolidated statement of operations. Conversely, to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary, that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed, which generally reduces the Company's income tax expense.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nBusiness Segments\n\u2022Generated consolidated net loss of $11.5 million, which included an $8.8 million loss on extinguishment of debt and $46.0 million of discrete costs expensed in the period related to the ModSpace integration and other acquisition-related activities, including $26.6 million of integration costs, $11.5 million of impairment of long-lived assets and lease impairment expense and other related charges, $3.8 million of restructuring cost, and $4.1 of other expense. The consolidated net loss of $11.5 million represented an improvement of $42.1 million as compared to the same period in 2018.\nThe average utilization rate of our modular lease units is the ratio of (i) the average number of units in use during a period (which includes units from the time they are leased to a customer until the time they are returned to us) to (ii) the average total number of units available for lease in our modular fleet during a period. Our average monthly rental rate per unit for a period is equal to the ratio of (i) our rental income for that period including VAPS but excluding delivery and installation services, to (ii) the average number of modular lease units rented to our customers during that period.\nImpairment losses on Goodwill: Impairment losses on goodwill were $0.0 million and $60.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The 2017 impairment loss on goodwill relates to our reporting unit in Canada.\nfrom operations, together with amounts available under the ABL Facility, will be adequate to permit us to meet our obligations over the next twelve months. However, we cannot assure you that our cash provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents or cash available under our ABL Facility, will be sufficient to meet our future needs. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future, and if availability under our ABL Facility is not sufficient, we may have to obtain additional financing.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, 9.6% of our revenues were from the Modular - Other North America segment, markets in Canada, including Alaska, and Mexico. Revenues from this segment had declined since 2014 as a result of exposure to upstream oil and gas end markets in Alberta, Canada and Alaska. While average modular space units on rent and rental rates have stabilized, competitive pressures in these markets may continue to impact performance until utilization across the industry improves.\nGross Profit: Gross profit increased $115.6 million, or 77.7%, to $264.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $148.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in gross profit was driven by higher revenues driven both by the Acton, Tyson and ModSpace acquisitions and by organic growth. The increase in gross profit from higher revenues was partially offset by a $46.1 million, or 76.5% increase in depreciation of rental equipment for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily related to acquired units in the Acton, Tyson, and ModSpace acquisitions, and as a result of continued capital investment in our fleet.\nRevenue: Total revenue increased $312.3 million, or 41.6%, to $1,063.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $751.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily the result of a 43.3% increase in leasing and services revenue driven by increased volumes from acquisitions and improved pricing. Improved volumes were driven by units acquired as part of the ModSpace acquisition, as well as, increased modular delivery and installation revenues on the combined rental fleet of 42.4% due to increased transaction volumes and higher revenues per transaction. Average modular space monthly rental rates increased 11.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019, and average modular space units on rent increased 21,425 units, or 30.5%, due to the impact of an additional 8.5 months of contribution from the ModSpace acquisition. Improved pricing was driven by a combination of our price optimization tools and processes, as well as, by continued growth in our Ready to Work\u201d solutions and increased VAPS penetration across our customer base, offset partially by the average modular space monthly rental rates on acquired units for ModSpace. The increase in leasing and services revenues was further complemented by an increase of $5.5 million, or 10.3%, in new unit sales as compared to 2018. This increase was primarily driven by increased sales as a result of the ModSpace acquisition. Rental unit sales increased $15.3 million, or 61.2%, as compared to 2018.\nRevenue: Total revenue increased $28.1 million, or 38.1%, to $101.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $73.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Modular leasing revenue increased $17.6 million, or 36.0%, which is primarily driven by improved volumes and pricing. Average modular space units on rent increased by 2,052 units, or 29.6% to 8,973 units on rent, and average modular space monthly rental rates in the Modular - Other North America segment increased 5.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $590. Improved volumes were driven by units acquired as part of the ModSpace acquisition, as well as increased modular delivery and installation revenues, which increased $2.3 million, or 14.0%, due to increased transaction volumes as a result of the combined company. Improved pricing was driven by a combination of our price optimization tools and processes as well as by continued growth in our Ready to Work\u201d solutions and increased VAPS penetration across our customer base, as well as by the average modular space monthly rental rates on acquired units. New unit sales revenue decreased $0.4 million, or 8.7%, associated with decreased sale opportunities. Rental unit sales revenue increased $8.6 million, or 220.5%, as a result of several large rental unit sale opportunities during the year.\n\nAt December 31, 2019, in addition to the above contractual obligations, the Company had $22.6 million of potential long-term tax liabilities, including interest and penalties, related to uncertain tax positions. Because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the future cash flows associated with these potential long-term tax liabilities, the Company is unable to estimate the years in which settlement will occur with the respective taxing authorities.\nRental Equipment\nIf the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the calculated fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment charge would be recognized for the excess, not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nImpairment losses on Goodwill: There were no impairment losses on goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nSG&A Expense: SG&A expense increased $92.5 million, or 57.0%, to $254.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $162.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The majority of the increases in the Modular- US and Modular - Other North America segments were driven by the acquisitions of Acton and ModSpace during the year, as well as by $50.1 million of integration and transaction costs incurred during 2018 related to these acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by a $45.1 million reduction of costs in Corporate and other related to Algeco Group costs no longer included in our operations.\nPrior to the Business Combination in the fourth quarter of 2017, WSII was subject to a centralized cash management strategy utilized by the Algeco Group. As part of this strategy, significant intercompany notes due to and from Algeco Group affiliates were created to fund the operating needs of certain Algeco Group affiliates as well as to fund the debt obligations of the Algeco Group. The impacts of these notes are included within investing and financing activities in our 2017 consolidated statements of cash flows. Additionally, prior to the Business Combination, the activity of the Remote Accommodations Business, which is no longer part of the Company, is included within the 2017 consolidated statements of cash flows. The significant non-cash activity of the Remote Accommodations Business is discussed further in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022Total revenues increased by $312.3 million, or 41.6% as compared to the same period in 2018, driven by a 43.3% increase in our core leasing and services revenues from both organic pricing growth, and the impact of an additional 8.5 months of contribution from the ModSpace acquisition during 2019 (discussed in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements). New and rental unit sales increased 10.3% and 61.2%, respectively, also driven by acquisitions.\nOther (income) expense, net primarily consists of the non-recurring gain (loss) on disposal of non-operational property, plant and equipment, other financing related costs and other non-recurring charges.\nInterest Expense: Interest expense increased $24.1 million, or 24.5%, to $122.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $98.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in interest expense is attributable to the increased financing costs for the full year in 2019, as a result of the ModSpace acquisition which occurred in the third quarter of 2018, offset in part by the one-time bridge financing and upfront commitment fees expensed in 2018 and lower interest costs due to the redemption of our Unsecured Notes in June 2019. In the third quarter of 2018, as part of financing the ModSpace acquisition, we upsized our ABL Facility to $1.425 billion, issued the 2023 Secured Notes, and issued the Unsecured Notes and incurred bridge financing fees and upfront commitment fees of $20.5 million which were recorded to interest expense.\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nRestructuring Costs: Restructuring costs were $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The 2018 restructuring charges relate entirely to employee termination and lease breakage costs related to the Acton and ModSpace acquisitions and integrations. The 2017 restructuring charges relate to the Algeco Group corporate function and related employee termination costs.\n-Average modular space units on rent increased by 19,373 units, or 30.6%, due to the impact of an additional 8.5 months of contribution from the ModSpace acquisition.\nRevenue: Total revenue increased $305.5 million, or 68.5%, to $751.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $445.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily the result of a 73.5% increase in leasing and services revenue driven by increased volumes from acquisitions and improved pricing. Improved volumes were driven by units acquired as part of the Acton, Tyson, and ModSpace acquisitions and organic unit on rent growth, as well as increased modular delivery and installation revenues on the combined rental fleet of 72.0% due to increased transaction volumes. Average modular space monthly rental rates increased 2.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018, and average modular space units on rent increased 28,994 units, or 70.3%. Improved pricing was driven by a combination of our price optimization tools and processes, as well as by continued growth in our Ready to Work\u201d solutions and increased VAPS penetration across our customer base, offset partially by the average modular space monthly rental rates on acquired units for Acton, Tyson, and ModSpace. The increase in leasing and services revenues was further complemented by an increase of\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nInterest Expense: Interest expense decreased $20.9 million, or 17.5%, to $98.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $119.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Upon consummation of the Business Combination in November 2017, we issued the 2022 Secured Notes and entered into the ABL Facility to fund our operations as a stand-alone company. In the third quarter as part of financing the ModSpace acquisition, we upsized our ABL Facility to $1.425 billion, issued the 2023 Secured Notes, and issued the Unsecured Notes. In connection with the ModSpace acquisition, the Company incurred bridge financing fees and upfront commitment fees of $20.5 million in the third quarter, which are included in interest expense in 2018 and are not expected to reoccur.\n-On a pro forma basis, including results of WillScot and ModSpace for all periods presented, average modular space monthly rental rate increased 14.9% organically, with average modular space units on rent down 4.5% and average modular space monthly utilization up by 40 basis points ( bps\u201d) during the year to 74.2%.\n\u2022On a pro forma basis, including results of WillScot and ModSpace for all periods presented:\nThe adoption of ASC 842 at January 1, 2019, did not have a significant impact on the recognition of leasing revenue. Per the requirements of ASC 842 the Company records changes in estimated collectibility, directly against leasing revenue.\n\u2022Delivery and installation of the modular or portable storage unit;\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we consider reasonable under the circumstances, and reevaluate our estimates and judgments as appropriate. The actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity in the preparation of financial statements:\nOther Depreciation and Amortization: Other depreciation and amortization decreased $0.9 million, or 6.8%, to $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in other depreciation and amortization was driven primarily by lower depreciation as a result of the decrease in property, plant and equipment. Property, plant and equipment decreased as a result of the transfer of non-producing branches to assets held for sale which are no longer depreciated and the impact of the adoption of ASC 842 which resulted in the reversal of branch assets previously accounted for as failed sale-lease back locations which are compliant sales under ASC 842.\nIn accordance with applicable authoritative guidance, the Company accounts for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach; a more-likely-than-not recognition criterion; and a measurement approach that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If it is not more-likely-than-not that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits, no benefit is recorded. Uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold. The Company classifies interest on tax deficiencies and income tax penalties within income tax expense.\nRevenue Recognition\nGross Profit: Our gross profit percentage was 38.9% and 38.5% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our gross profit percentage, excluding the effects of depreciation (\"adjusted gross profit percentage\"), was 55.3% and 54.7% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nIn addition to focusing on GAAP measurements, we focus on Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow to measure our operating results. As such, we include in this Annual Report on Form 10-K reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations and descriptions of why we believe these measures provide useful information to investors as well as a description of the limitations of these measures are included in Item 6. Selected Financial Data.\u201d\nOther depreciation and amortization includes depreciation of our property, plant and equipment, as well as the amortization of our intangible assets.\nLease Impairment Expense and Other Related Charges: Lease impairment expense and other related charges was $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Effective January 1,2019, in connection with the adoption of ASC 842, we recorded $4.2 million in ROU asset impairments, $2.6 million in rent on closed locations and $1.9 million in lease termination fees.\nExecutive Summary\nThe Company's payment terms vary by the type and location of its customer and the product or services offered. The time between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. While the Company may bill certain customers in advance, its contracts do not contain a significant financing component based on the short length of time between upfront billings and the performance of contracted services. For certain products, services, or customer types, the Company requires payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer.\n\u2022Maintenance and other ad hoc services performed during the lease term; and\nCash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $26.1 million as compared to $1,180.0 million cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $1,206.1 million cash used. The increase in cash used by financing activities is primarily due to a reduction in borrowings, net of repayments of $1,086.0 million, a decrease in receipts from the issuance of common stock of $146.3 million primarily related to the financing of the ModSpace acquisition and an increase in debt extinguishment costs of $7.1 million. In connection with the ModSpace acquisition, in 2018 we borrowed an aggregate of $1,097.1 million related to the issuance of the 2023 Secured Notes and the Unsecured Notes, and through the up-sized ABL Facility. The 2018 stock issuance was used to finance the acquisition of ModSpace. We paid redemption premium costs of $7.1 million in 2019 as a result of the redemption of the Unsecured Notes and the $30.0 million prepayment on the 2022 Secured Notes. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by a decrease in financing fees payments of $34.0 million due to the significant fees incurred in 2018 as part of the financing activities noted above in connected with the acquisition of ModSpace.\n\u2022the average utilization rate of our modular lease units; and\nOn a pro forma basis, including results of WillScot and ModSpace for all periods presented, total revenues decreased $2.9 million, or 2.8%, year over year for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decline was driven by reduced modular delivery and installation revenues and reduced new unit sales, which declined $6.1 million, or 24.7%, and $2.2 million, or 33.7%, respectively. The decline in modular delivery and installation revenues was driven by several large projects that began or were completed during the prior year and resulted in large delivery and installation revenues. These declines were partially offset by increased rental unit sales of $4.5 million, or 56.9%. Core modular leasing revenues increased $0.8 million, or 1.3%, with increases in pro forma average modular space monthly rental rates of $25, or 4.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, being partially offset by a decrease in modular space units on rent of 2.5% on a pro forma basis to 8,973. Pro forma utilization for our modular space units decreased to 56.1%, down 30 bps from 56.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOptimizing Cash Flow through Strategic Deployment of Capital.\nAdjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA increased $12.4 million, or 64.9%, to $31.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily driven by higher modular leasing margin due to increased modular volumes and average monthly rental rates, offset by increased SG&A expense, excluding discrete items, of $4.1 million primarily related to the ModSpace acquisition. Employee costs increased $1.5 million as a result of the increased size of our workforce. Occupancy costs increased $2.8 million largely due to the expansion of our branch network and storage lots.\nAmerica, as well as a highly scalable corporate center and management information systems, which we believe positions us well to continue to acquire and integrate other companies. We may pursue acquisitions that will provide further scale efficiencies to our platform, allowing us to improve returns generated by the acquired assets.\nCurrency (Gains) Losses, Net\nComponents of Our Consolidated Historical Results of Operations\nGross Profit: Our gross profit percentage was 38.5% and 37.1% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our gross profit percentage, excluding the effects of depreciation (\"adjusted gross profit percentage\"), was 54.7% and 53.4% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nWe maintain a disciplined focus on our return on capital. As part of this discipline, we diligently consider the potential returns and opportunity costs associated with each investment we make. We continually assess both our existing lease fleet and customer demand for opportunities to deploy capital more efficiently. We manage our maintenance capital expenditures as well as growth capital expenditures to best fit the economic conditions at the time. Within our existing lease fleet, we examine the potential cash and earnings generation of an asset sale versus continuing to lease the asset. In addition, we examine the relative benefits of organic expansion opportunities versus expansion through acquisition to obtain a favorable return on capital.\nCash Flows\n-Sales revenue declined $46.9 million, or 32.1%, driven primarily by one large new sale recognized in 2018 from ModSpace related to hurricane relief in the amount of $29.0 million in our Modular - US segment.\nInterest income consists of interest on notes due from affiliates which were settled in 2017.\n$17.2 million, or 47.3% in new unit sales as compared to 2017 primarily driven by increased sales as a result of the ModSpace acquisition, which historically had higher new sales than WillScot, including a single large sale project serviced by the Modular - US segment that accounted for nearly half of the revenue variance. Rental unit sales increased $3.1 million, or 14.2% as compared to 2017.\nTotal average units on rent for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were 85,737 and 53,862, respectively. The increase was due to units acquired as part of the Acton, Tyson, and ModSpace acquisitions and organic improvements in modular space average units on rent, with modular space average units on rent increased by 28,994 units, or 70.3% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Modular space average monthly rental rates increased 2.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Portable storage average units on rent increased by 2,881 units, or 22.9% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Average portable storage monthly rental rates increased 2.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The average modular space unit utilization rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 71.6%, as compared to 70.3% during the same period in 2017. The increase in average modular space utilization rate was driven by a reduction in the combined modular space unit fleet size during the period across the WillScot, ModSpace, Acton and Tyson fleet. The average portable storage unit utilization rate during the year ended December 31, 2018 was 68.9%, as compared to 71.4% during the same period in 2017. The decrease in average portable storage utilization rate was driven by organic declines in the number of portable storage average units on rent in the Modular - US segment.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nDepreciation is generally computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, as follows:\nIncome Tax Benefit: Income tax benefit increased $37.7 million to $38.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in tax benefit was principally driven by the pre-tax loss tax benefit of $19.4 million, a tax benefit of $11.9 million, related to a reduction in the valuation allowance and a tax benefit of $7.0 million related to a change in the Company asserting indefinite re-investment in certain of its foreign businesses. In 2017, a pre-tax loss tax benefit was reduced by the impairment of Canadian Goodwill, an unfavorable permanent adjustment, with no tax basis which reduces the expected pre-tax loss benefit. In addition, as a result of the Tax Act, the Company remeasured their net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a net tax benefit of $28.1 million which was offset by a $50.5 million valuation allowance at December 22, 2017. Also, refer to Note 14 regarding the Tax Act enacted in the US on December 22, 2017 and additional components of the rate reconciliation.\n-Consolidated modular space average monthly rental rate increased to $614 representing an 11.2% increase year over year.\nIncome Taxes\nAdjusted EBITDA: Corporate and other costs and eliminations to consolidated Adjusted EBITDA increased $15.1 million or 100.0% to $0.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from a loss of $15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The 2017 costs related to the Algeco Group operations, which separated from the Company in 2017. Similar costs incurred in 2019 and 2018 by WillScot are included primarily in the Modular - US segment.\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognized for the income taxes on the undistributed earnings of wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries unless such earnings are permanently reinvested, or will only be repatriated when possible to do so at minimal additional tax cost. Current income tax relating to items recognized directly in equity is recognized in equity and not in profit (loss) for the year.\nSG&A expenses in the Modular- US and Modular - Other North America segments increased $137.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 2017. Integration costs incurred in 2018 were $30.0 million, as compared to no costs in 2017, which include discrete training costs, fleet relocation costs, branch exit costs, and professional service expenses related to the Acton and ModSpace integrations. Employee costs increased $43.4 million driven by the increased size of the workforce before realization of all expected employee savings to be achieved as a result of restructuring activities. Occupancy costs increased $13.8 million largely due to the expansion of our branch network and storage lots before expected savings are realized as we exit redundant locations. Transaction costs, excluding those in Corporate and other, increased $18.3 million primarily related to costs incurred related to the acquisition of ModSpace. Legal and professional fees increased $10.9 million over 2017 before realization of all expected cost savings and due to operating as a public company for all of 2018. The remaining increases of $21.3 million are primarily related to increased insurance, computer, marketing, office, tax and bad debt expenses related to operating a larger operation as a result of our recent acquisitions and our expanded employee base and branch network.\nCash flows from investing activities\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCurrency (gains) losses, net include unrealized and realized gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies other than our functional currency at the reporting date.\nWe are a leading provider of modular space and portable storage solutions in the US, Canada and Mexico. As of December 31, 2019, our branch network included approximately 120 locations and additional drop lots to better service our more than 50,000 customers across the US, Canada, and Mexico. We offer our customers an extensive selection of ready to work\u201d modular space and portable storage solutions with over 125,000 modular space units and over 25,000 portable storage units in our fleet. We remain focused on our core priorities of growing modular leasing revenues by increasing modular space units on rent, both organically and through our consolidation strategy, delivering Ready to Work\u201d solutions to our customers with VAPS and on continually improving the overall customer experience.\nRefer to the Recent Developments section in Part I, Item 1, Business, herein for further information about our recent warrant redemption and merger agreement.\nThe following summarizes our change in cash and cash equivalents cash flows for the periods presented:\n-Average modular space monthly rental rate increased 5.5% to $590.\nOther Matters\nCurrency (Gains) Losses, net: Currency (gains) losses, net were a $2.5 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to a $12.9 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in currency gains was primarily attributable to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on loans and borrowings and intercompany receivables and payables denominated in a currency other than the subsidiaries' functional currency. The majority of the intercompany receivables and payables contributing to these gains and losses were settled concurrently with the Business Combination.\nImpairment Losses on Long-Lived Assets\nOur selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expense includes all costs associated with our selling efforts, including marketing costs, marketing salaries and benefits, as well as commissions of sales personnel. It also includes integration and transaction costs associated with acquisitions and business combinations, our overhead costs, such as salaries of administrative and corporate personnel and the leasing of facilities we occupy. General and administrative costs in our historical results for Corporate and other relate to the Algeco Group's corporate costs incurred prior to or in connection with the Business Combination which are not anticipated to be recurring costs.\n\u2022the number of units in our modular lease fleet;\n(a) See Reconciliation of non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d in Item 6 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe table below sets forth the average number of units on rent in our modular lease fleet, the average utilization of our modular lease units, and the average monthly rental rate per unit, including VAPS:\nIncome from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company's lease arrangements typically include multiple lease and non-lease components. Examples of lease components include, but are not limited to, the lease of modular space or portable storage units, and examples of non-lease components include, but are not limited to, the delivery, installation, maintenance, and removal services commonly provided in a bundled transaction with the lease components. Arrangement consideration is allocated between lease deliverables and non-lease components based on the relative estimated selling (leasing) price of each deliverable. Estimated selling (leasing) price of the lease deliverables is based upon the estimated stand-alone selling price of the related performance obligations using an adjusted market approach.\n-Average modular space units on rent increased by 2,052 units, or 29.6%, as compared to the same period in 2018 driven primarily by acquired units from the ModSpace transaction.\nModular - Other North America Segment\nThe majority of the interest costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2017 relate to the previous debt structure of WSII as part of the Algeco Group, including $58.4 million of interest expense incurred in 2017 on notes payable to affiliates, which were settled in full in connection with the Algeco Group restructuring that occurred prior to the Business Combination. The decrease in interest expense is driven by our lower average debt and notes payable balances in 2018 under our new debt structure as compared to the Algeco Group debt structure in place in 2017, partially offset by bridge financing and upfront commitment fees of $20.5 million incurred in connection with the ModSpace acquisition and higher average debt balances subsequent to the August of 2018 ModSpace acquisition. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt, and the additional debt incurred during the third quarter as part of financing the ModSpace acquisition, which we expect will increase our interest expense in future periods.\nThe Company generally has three non-lease service-related performance obligations in its contracts with customers:\nWe estimate cost synergies of approximately $6.4 million related to the Acton and Tyson acquisitions were realized in 2018 and our integration plans remain on track. Acton sales and operations were integrated in April of 2018, and effective November 1, 2018, we began delivering all units acquired from ModSpace under a combined operating and information technology platform. Effective January 7, 2019, we completed the ModSpace system integration and all billing activities on existing ModSpace contracts are now fully integrated. Exit activities for redundant branch locations, such as preparing units and materials for transport to other locations remain on schedule. These activities are expected to continue through 2019 and we expect over $60.0 million of annual reoccurring cost savings as we execute the established integration plans for Acton and ModSpace.\n-Modular space average monthly rental rate of $617 increased 12.0% year over year including the dilutive impacts of acquisitions. Improved pricing was driven by a combination of our price optimization tools and processes, as well as by continued growth in our \"Ready to Work\" solutions and increased VAPS penetration across our customer base.\nWe account for acquisitions of businesses under the acquisition method. Under the acquisition method of accounting, we record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair value on the date of acquisition. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable net assets. Estimated fair values of acquired assets and liabilities are provisional and could change as additional information is received. Valuations are finalized as soon as practicable, but not later than one year from the acquisition date. Any subsequent changes to purchase price allocations result in a corresponding adjustment to goodwill.\nRevenue is recognized net of taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\nLease impairment expense and other related charges include impairment of right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets under ASC 842, gain or loss on the exit of a leased property generally associated with lease termination payments and rent expense for locations which have been closed but have not been abandoned or impaired.\nInterest Income\nIncome Tax Benefit\nImpairment Losses on Goodwill\nGross Profit: Gross profit increased $110.5 million, or 41.8%, to $374.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $264.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in gross profit was driven by higher revenues driven both by the ModSpace acquisition and by organic growth. The increase in gross profit from higher revenues was partially offset by a $50.0 million, or 47.0% increase in depreciation of rental equipment for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily related to units acquired in the ModSpace acquisition, and as a result of continued capital investment in our fleet.\nCash flows from financing activities\nSG&A Expense: SG&A expense increased $16.1 million, or 6.3%, to $271.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $254.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Employee costs increased $19.5 million driven by the increased size of the workforce, offset partially by employee savings achieved as a result of restructuring activities; and occupancy costs increased $10.3 million largely due to the expansion of our branch network and storage lots, including a portion of the expected cost savings as we have now exited approximately 85% of redundant real estate locations.\nGross Profit: The Corporate and other adjustments to revenue and gross profit pertain to the elimination of intercompany leasing transactions between the Modular business segments and the legacy Remote Accommodations Business segment, which was carved out in 2017 and is reflected as discontinued operations in our financial statements.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nContractual Obligations\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help the reader understand WillScot, our operations and our present business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto, contained in Item 8 of this report. As a result of the Business Combination, (i) WillScot's consolidated financial results for periods prior to November 29, 2017 reflect the financial results of WSII and its consolidated subsidiaries, as the accounting predecessor to WillScot, and (ii) for periods from and after this date, WillScot's financial results reflect those of WillScot and its consolidated subsidiaries (including WSII and its subsidiaries) as the successor following the Business Combination. We use certain non-GAAP financial information that we believe is important for purposes of comparison to prior periods and development of future projections and earnings growth prospects. This information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are provided where presented.\nOur liquidity as of December 31, 2019 consisted of cash and cash equivalents and unused commitments under our ABL Facility which is discussed below. Our practice is to maintain sufficient liquidity through cash from operations and our ABL Facility, to mitigate the impacts of any adverse financial market conditions on our operations. We believe that cash generated\nThe key drivers of changes in our leasing revenue are:\nConsideration is allocated to each of these performance obligations within the contract based upon their estimated relative standalone selling prices using the estimated cost plus a margin approach. Revenue from these activities is recognized as the services are performed.\nOur Business and Growth Strategies\nGenerating Additional Cash Flow Through Operational Efficiencies and Cost Reductions.\nBusiness Segment Results\nServices Revenue\nOther (Income) Expense, Net\nGross Profit: Gross profit increased $7.6 million, or 43.4%, to $25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $17.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The effects of favorable foreign currency movements increased gross profit by $0.6 million, as the Canadian Dollar and Mexican Peso strengthened against the US dollar during the year. The increase in gross profit, excluding the effects of foreign currency, was driven by higher revenues as a result of the ModSpace acquisition and organic growth. The increase in gross profit from higher revenues was partially offset by a $2.8 million, or 22.8% increase in depreciation of rental equipment for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily related to acquired units in ModSpace acquisition.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $1.6 billion of total nominal indebtedness outstanding. A substantial portion of our liquidity needs arise from debt service on our indebtedness and from the funding of our costs of operations and capital expenditures.\nThe Company performs its annual impairment test of goodwill as of October 1 at the reporting unit level, as well as during any reporting period in which events or changes in circumstances that, in management's judgment, may constitute triggering events under ASC 350-20, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, Testing Goodwill for Impairment. The Company uses an independent valuation specialist for its annual impairment tests to assist in the valuation.\n\nWe combine product quality and availability, the largest service network in North America, an industry-leading offering of VAPS and a commitment to customer service to provide increased value to our customers. This attracts new customers, increases customer retention and increases our margins. We intend to grow the business by continuing to improve the quality, delivery and service of our products and by continuing to introduce new and innovative products and services that complement our core offering to the most attractive industry and geographic end markets.\n\u2022Generated Free Cash Flow of $20.0 million in 2019, as net cash provided by operating activities of $172.6 million after funding $26.6 million of integration costs was reinvested primarily in value added products and fleet refurbishments to support growth of modular leasing revenues (net cash used in investing activities of $152.6 million) and to pay down debt $16.5 million.\n(a) Long-term indebtedness includes borrowings and interest under the ABL Facility and the Senior Secured Notes.\nIn addition to leasing revenue, we also generate revenue from sales of new and used modular space and portable storage units to our customers, as well as delivery, installation, maintenance, removal services and other incidental items related to accommodations services for our customers. Included in our sales revenue are charges for modifying or customizing sales equipment to customers' specifications.\nWe have implemented a number of management initiatives designed to improve operations and increase profitability, efficiency and operating leverage. We continually assess our branch operating footprint, our vendor base, and our operating structure to maximize revenue generation while minimizing costs. The acquisitions of Acton and ModSpace provided us with increased scale that allowed us to reduce from over 200 combined operating locations to approximately 120 operating locations by the end of 2019. With this post-acquisition scale, we expect to extract over $60.0 million of redundant costs from the combined businesses. As of December 31, 2019, we estimate that we have realized over $40 million of cumulative savings related to the Acton and ModSpace acquisitions and subsequent integrations. We have a proven track record of efficiently integrating acquisitions and quickly eliminating operational redundancies, while maintaining acquired customer relationships.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nWe recognize goodwill impairment charges associated with our reporting units when the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit.\nLeasing Revenue\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nOther Depreciation and Amortization\n-Modular leasing revenues increased $53.4 million, or 7.7%, driven by a 13.7% year over year increase in modular space average monthly rental rates as a result of our price optimization tools and processes, as well as by continued growth in our Ready to Work\u201d solutions and increased VAPS penetration across our customer base.\nRestructuring Costs: Restructuring costs were $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The 2019 restructuring charges related primarily to employee termination costs as a result of the ModSpace acquisition and integration. The 2018 restructuring charges are comprised of employee termination and lease breakage costs related to the Acton and ModSpace acquisitions and integrations. Prior to the adoption of ASC 842 effective January 1. 2019, the costs associated with leases exited as a result of a restructuring plan were recorded in restructuring expense.\nWe are continuously working to increase the utilization and yield of our lease fleet by improving the efficiency and performance of our sales force, expanding penetration of VAPS and enhancing our management information systems. Effective use of real-time information allows us to monitor and optimize the utilization of our fleet, allocate our fleet to the highest demand markets, optimize pricing and determine the best allocation of our capital to invest in fleet and branches as well as to identify opportunities where underutilized lease fleet can be sold to generate cash.\nModular - US Segment\nYears Ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017\nOn a pro forma basis, including results of WillScot and ModSpace for all periods presented, total revenues decreased $0.4 million, or 0.0%, year-over-year for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decline was driven by reduced new sales, which declined $41.6 million, or 41.3%, as a result of one large sale recognized in 2018 in the amount of $29.0 million in our Modular - US segment, and decreased rental unit sales, which declined $5.3 million, or 11.7%. The declines in sales volumes were nearly offset by an increase in our core modular leasing revenues, which increased $53.4 million, or 7.7%, as a result of a 13.7% increase in average modular space monthly rental rates.\nThe Company's non-lease revenues do not include material amounts of variable consideration, other than the variability noted for services arrangements expected to be performed beyond a twelve month period.\nImpairment losses on Long-Lived Assets: Impairment losses on long-lived assets were $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $0.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we reclassified certain branch facilities that we intend to exit from property, plant and equipment to held for sale and recognized an impairment on these assets as the estimated fair value was less than the carrying value of the facilities.\n\u2022Generated Adjusted EBITDA of $356.5 million in 2019, representing an increase of $141.0 million or 65.4% as compared to the same period in 2018, which includes the impact of an additional 8.5 months of contribution from the ModSpace acquisition in 2019, as well as continued realization of commercial and cost synergies associated with the ModSpace and Acton acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA for the Modular - US segment and the Modular - Other North America segment, respectively, was $325.0 million and $31.5 million in 2019.\nCapital Expenditures: Capital expenditures for rental equipment increased $3.7 million, or 63.8%, to $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was driven by increased spend for new units, VAPS, and refurbishments as a result of the increased fleet size due to the ModSpace acquisition. During the year, our modular space unit fleet grew by over 65%.\nAdjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA increased $6.0 million, or 45.8%, to $19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $13.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily driven by higher modular leasing margin due to increased modular volumes and average monthly rental rates, offset by increased SG&A expense, excluding discrete items, of $4.3 million primarily related to the ModSpace acquisition during the year. Employee costs increased $2.0 million as a result of the increased size of the workforce and before realization of all expected employee savings as a result of the restructuring to capture operating synergies as a result of integrating these businesses into WillScot. Occupancy costs increased $1.0 million largely due to the expansion of our branch network and storage lots before expected savings are realized as we exit redundant locations. The remaining increases of $1.2 million are primarily related to increased insurance, computer, marketing, office, tax and bad debt expenses related to operating a larger operation as a result of our recent acquisition and our expanded employee base and branch network.\n-Total revenues decreased $0.4 million, as the impact of non-recurring sales in the prior year were nearly offset by continued strong organic growth in our core leasing revenues.\n\u2022the average monthly rental rate per unit, including VAPS.\n-Consolidated average modular space units on rent increased 21,425, or 30.5%, year over year, driven by an additional 8.5 months of contribution from the ModSpace acquisition, and average modular space utilization increased 40 basis points ( bps\u201d) year over year to 72.0%.\nWillScot is a holding company that derives all of its operating cash flow from its operating subsidiaries. Our principal sources of liquidity include cash generated by operating activities from our subsidiaries, credit facilities, and sales of equity and debt securities.\nOther (Income) Expense, Net: Other expense, net was $4.6 million of other income for the year ended December 31, 2018 and $2.8 million of other expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in other income was driven by the receipt of insurance proceeds related to assets damaged during Hurricane Harvey which contributed $4.8 million and other settlements which contributed $0.8 million to other (income) expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nImpairment losses on Long-Lived Assets: Impairment losses on long-lived assets were $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. In 2019 and 2018, we reclassified certain branch facilities from property, plant and equipment to assets held for sale and recognized an impairment on these assets as the estimated fair value was less than the carrying value of the facilities.\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $1,180.0 million as compared to $396.8 million cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $783.2 million. The increase is primarily driven by a $1,093.2 million increase in borrowings net of repayments and a $123.9 million decrease in net repayments on notes due to affiliates. In order to finance the cash consideration for the acquisition of ModSpace in the third quarter of 2018, we issued $300.0 million of 2023 Secured Notes, issued $200.0 million of Unsecured Notes, and borrowed an additional $597.1 million on the up-sized ABL Facility, which drove the overall increase in borrowings, net of repayments. In 2017, in connection with the Business Combination, the obligations under the notes due to affiliates were settled and there was no activity related to these notes in 2018. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by a $424.6 million decrease in cash receipts from the issuance of common stock. We had cash receipts of $147.2 million and $571.8 million from the issuance of common stock during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The 2018 stock issuance was used to finance the acquisition of ModSpace and the 2017 stock issuance was made in connection with the Business Combination.\nRecent Developments\nCapital Expenditures: Capital expenditures for rental equipment increased $42.0 million, or 27.7%, to $193.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $151.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Net capital expenditures also increased $24.4 million, or 19.0%, to $152.5 million. The increases for both were driven by increased spend for refurbishments and VAPS to drive revenue growth and for maintenance of a larger fleet following our recent acquisitions.\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.\nThe US market for modular space and portable storage solutions is fragmented, with approximately 60% of the modular space market supplied by regional and local competitors. We have a broad network of operating branches in North\nLeveraging Scale via Acquisitions.\nDiscrete items included in SG&A decreased for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, by $17.7 million as decreases in transaction and integration costs related to the ModSpace and Acton acquisitions and subsequent integrations of $20.1 million and $4.0 million, respectively, were partially offset by increases in stock compensation expense and other acquisition-related activities of $3.3 million and $3.1 million, respectively.\nGross profit increased $123.8 million, or 74.8%, to $289.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $165.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in gross profit is a result of a $285.1 million increase in modular leasing and services revenue and increased new unit sales gross profit of $6.3 million, offset by increases of $118.0 million in modular leasing and services costs. Increases in modular leasing and services revenues and costs were primarily as a result of increased revenues due to additional units on rent as a result of recent acquisitions as well as increased margins due to favorable average monthly rental rates on modular space units. These increases were partially offset by increased depreciation of $48.8 million as a result of additional rental equipment acquired as part of the Acton, Tyson, and ModSpace acquisitions, as well as continued capital investment in our existing rental equipment.\nThe following tables and discussion summarize our reportable segment financial information for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Consistent with the presentation of our financial statements, the below segment results only include results from Acton, Tyson, and ModSpace for the periods subsequent to the respective acquisition dates and do not include any unrealized incremental cost savings, revenue growth, or pro forma adjustments that management expects to result from the integrations of the acquired businesses. Future changes to our organizational structure may result in changes to the segments disclosed.\nRevenue\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $1,217.2 million as compared to $392.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $824.5 million. This increase was principally the result of an increase in cash used of $846.0 million for the acquisition of businesses and an increase in cash used of $49.2 million for the purchase of rental equipment. In 2018, we acquired ModSpace and Tyson for combined cash consideration of $1,083.1 million compared to the acquisition of Acton in 2017 for cash consideration of $237.1 million. We incurred capital expenditures for the purchase of rental equipment of $160.9 million and $111.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures was driven primarily by strategic investment in refurbishment of existing fleet, purchase of VAPS, and new fleet purchases to maintain and grow units on rent. The increase in cash used in investing activities was partially offset by a $67.8 million decrease in cash used in lending activities to affiliates. In 2018, we did not engage in any lending activities as the notes due from affiliates were settled as part of the Business Combination in 2017.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the US, Canada and Mexico. Our overall effective tax rate is affected by a number of factors, such as the relative amounts of income we earn in differing tax jurisdictions, state and jurisdictional law changes, and certain non-deductible expenses such as compensation disallowance. The rate is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year, such as state legislation enactments. These discrete items may not be consistent from year to year. Income tax expense (benefit), deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nCash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $172.6 million as compared to $37.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $135.5 million. This increase was primarily due to a $159.1 million increase in net income, adjusted for non-cash items, in 2019 as compared to 2018, as a result of the impact of the ModSpace acquisition on operations, which is reflected in our results for all of 2019, but is only included for four and a half months in 2018. This increase in net income, adjusted for non-cash items, was partially offset by a decrease of $23.7 million in the net movements of the operating assets and liabilities. The decrease in operating assets and liabilities was attributable to an increase in trade receivables and an increase in cash interest payments during the year ended December 31, 2019, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.\nCapital Expenditures: Capital expenditures for rental equipment increased $2.2 million, or 23.2%, to $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was driven by increased spend for new fleet and VAPS to drive revenue growth and for maintenance of a larger fleet following the ModSpace acquisition. Net capital expenditures decreased $5.9 million, or 98.2%, to $0.1 million, as a result of increased rental unit sales in the period.\nWe define gross profit as the difference between total revenue and cost of revenue. Cost of revenues associated with our leasing business includes payroll and payroll-related costs for branch personnel, material and other costs related to the repair, maintenance, storage and transportation of rental equipment. Cost of revenue also includes depreciation expense associated with our rental equipment. Cost of revenues associated with our new unit sales business includes the cost to purchase, assemble, transport and customize units that are sold. Cost of revenues for our rental unit sales consist primarily of the net book value of the unit at date of sale.\nGross Profit\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, key drivers of financial performance included:\n-Average modular space monthly utilization increased 50 basis points ( bps\u201d) to 74.2% in 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018. This increase was driven primarily by de-fleeting activities associated with our integration efforts during year.\nThe following table presents information relating to our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2019:\nCash Flows from operating activities\nTrade Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWhen leases and services are billed in advance, recognition of revenue is deferred until services are rendered. If equipment is returned prior to the contractually obligated period, the excess, if any, between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay over the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date is recognized as incremental revenue upon return.\nGross Profit: Gross profit increased $13.4 million, or 53.4%, to $38.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The effects of favorable foreign currency movements increased gross profit by $0.3 million, as the Canadian Dollar and Mexican Peso strengthened against the US dollar during the year. The increase in gross profit, excluding the effects of foreign currency, was driven by higher revenues as a result of the ModSpace acquisition and organic growth. The increase in gross profit from higher revenues was partially offset by a $3.1 million, or 20.5%, increase in depreciation of rental equipment for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily related to units acquired in the ModSpace acquisition.\nITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe majority of revenue is generated by rental income subject to the guidance of ASC 840, Leases (\"ASC 840\") in 2017 and 2018 and ASC 842 in 2019. The remaining revenue is generated by performance obligations in contracts with customers for services or sale of units subject to the guidance in ASC 605, Revenue (\"ASC 605\"), in 2017 and 2018 and ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (\"ASC 606\") in 2019.\nCorporate and Other for the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nBorrowing Capacity and Availability\nModular Leasing and Services Revenue\nInterest Income: Interest income decreased $12.2 million, or 100.0%, to $0.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease is due to the decrease in the principal balance of notes due from affiliates, which were settled upon consummation of the Business Combination in November 2017.\nRevenue: Total revenue increased $284.1 million, or 41.9%, to $961.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $677.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Modular leasing revenue increased $208.2 million, or 44.4%, driven by improved volumes and pricing. Average modular space units on rent increased 19,373 units, or 30.6%, to 82,709 units on rent and resulting modular space utilization increased by 50 bps. Average modular space monthly rental rates in the Modular - US segment increased 12.0% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $617. Improved volumes were driven by units acquired as part of the ModSpace acquisition, as well as increased modular delivery and installation revenues, which increased $63.2 million, or 45.7%, due to the increased delivery volumes as compared to 2018. Improved pricing was driven by a combination of our price optimization tools and processes, as well as by continued growth in our Ready to Work\u201d solutions and increased VAPS penetration across our customer base, offset partially by the average modular space monthly rental rates on acquired units. New unit sales revenue increased $5.9 million, or 12.0%, in 2019 and rental unit sales revenue increased $6.8 million, or 32.2%. Increases for both new unit sales and rental unit sales were a result of the ModSpace acquisition and our larger post-acquisition fleet size.\nExpanding our Ready to Work\u201d Value Proposition.\nThese cost synergies are consistent with our integration plans and we expect to achieve annual recurring cost savings of over $70.0 million once our integration plans are fully executed and in our annual results.\nOn a pro forma basis, including results of WillScot and ModSpace for all periods presented, total revenues increased $2.4 million, or 0.2%, year over year for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was driven by modular leasing revenue, which increased $52.8 million, or 8.4%, driven primarily by continued pricing improvement, with increases in pro forma average modular space monthly rental rates of $80, or 14.9%, year over year for the year ended December 31, 2019. Offset by a decline in new sales, which decreased $39.5 million, or 41.9% driven primarily by one large sale recognized in 2018 in the amount of $29.0 million, and decreased rental unit sales, which declined $9.9 million, or 26.2%. Modular space units on rent decreased 4.5% on a pro forma basis to 82,709 and pro forma utilization for our modular space units increased to 74.2% up 40 bps from 73.8% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSales revenue is generated by the sale of new and rental units. Revenue from the sale of new and rental units is generally recognized at a point in time upon the transfer of control to the customer, which occurs when the unit is delivered and installed in accordance with the contract. Sales transactions constitute a single performance obligation.\nThe Company records deferred tax assets to the extent it believes that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized. In making such determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent results of operations. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized.\nCurrency (Gains) Losses, net: Currency (gains) losses, net were a $0.7 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a $2.5 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in currency losses was primarily attributable to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on loans and borrowings and intercompany receivables and payables denominated in a currency other than the subsidiaries' functional currency.\nThe remaining increases of $4.0 million are primarily related to increased professional fees, insurance, computer, travel, office and other expenses related to operating a larger business as a result of our recent acquisitions and our expanded employee base and branch network.", "item_7_tables": "Table 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

The increase was primarily driven by the ModSpace acquisition, which contributed an additional 8.5 months of results in 2019 versus 2018. Organic modular leasing revenues also increased due to higher pricing and volumes. \n\n- Adjusted EBITDA was $356.5 million in 2019, up 65.4% from 2018, again largely due to the ModSpace acquisition. On a pro forma basis, including ModSpace for the full year in both periods, Adjusted EBITDA increased 25.3% organically.\n\n- Net loss in 2019 was $11.5 million, an improvement from a $53.6 million net loss in 2018. The reduced loss was driven by higher revenues and gross profit contribution from ModSpace.\n\n- Cash from operations was $172.6 million in 2019 versus $37.1 million in 2018. The increase was due to higher net income adjusted for non-cash items. \n\n- Capital expenditures were $205.1 million in 2019, up from $160.9 million in 2018, driven by investments in value-added products, fleet refurbishments, and maintenance.\n\n- The company completed the integration of ModSpace in 2019, exiting over 200 combined operating locations down to 120, realizing over $40 million of cost synergies to date.\n\n- The company expects to continue gaining scale, optimizing utilization and yield of its fleet, expanding its \"Ready to Work\" value proposition, and leveraging acquisitions to drive growth and efficiencies.\n\nIn summary, the acquisition and integration of ModSpace was a key driver of WillScot's improved revenue, profitability and cash flow in 2019, and the company is focused on continuing to optimize its integrated business."}
