MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements, the notes thereto, and other statistical information included in this Annual Report.\nExecutive Summary\nThe Company offers a wide range of private banking, wealth management, and trust services to high net worth individuals, families, businesses and select institutions through its two reportable segments: (i) Private Banking and (ii) Wealth Management and Trust. This Executive Summary provides an overview of the most significant aspects of the Company's operating segments and operations. Details of the matters addressed in this summary are provided elsewhere in this document and, in particular, in the sections immediately following.\nNet income attributable to the Company was $45.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $80.0 million in 2019 and $80.4 million in 2018. The Company recognized Diluted earnings per share of $0.55 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $0.97 in 2019 and $0.92 in 2018. Key items that affected the Company's 2020 results include:\n\u2022Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $233.4 million, an increase of $5.4 million, or 2%, compared to 2019. The increase was primarily driven by lower funding costs and the addition of PPP-related income, partially offset by lower interest rates on interest-earning assets. NIM decreased 11 basis points to 2.69% in 2020 from 2.80% in 2019. The decrease in NIM in 2020 was driven primarily by lower yields on interest-earning assets and higher volumes of interest-earning assets, primarily excess cash balances held at lower rates due to higher deposit levels, partially offset by lower funding costs.\n\u2022Total core fees and income, which includes Wealth management and trust fees, Investment management fees, Other banking fee income, and Gain on sale of loans, net for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $91.7 million, a decrease of $6.8 million, or 7%, from 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by decreases in Investment management fees and Wealth Management and trust fees. The decrease in Investment management fees was driven primarily by the impact of negative net flows and lower equity market values on AUM during 2020. The decrease in Wealth management and trust fees was driven primarily by a reduction in the average effective fee rate during 2020 due to competitive forces.\n\u2022Average total loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $7.2 billion, an increase of 3% from 2019, driven primarily by the addition of PPP loans and an increase in Commercial real estate loans, partially offset by a decrease in Residential loans due to the $72.0 million of Residential loan sales in the third quarter of 2020.\n\u2022Average total deposits for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $7.6 billion, an increase of 13% from 2019, driven by an increase in new and existing client deposits, primarily in Money market accounts and Demand deposits, partially offset by a decrease in Certificates of deposits.\n\u2022The Company recorded a Provision for loan losses of $32.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a credit of $3.6 million in 2019. The 2020 Provision for loan losses was primarily driven by the change in Allowance for loan losses methodology from the incurred loss model to the current expected credit loss model, the current reasonable and supportable economic forecast deterioration as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the net change in qualitative factors to account for risks and assumptions related to our loan portfolio not incorporated in the forecasts.\n\u2022Total operating expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $241.3 million, an increase of $11.1 million, or 5%, from 2019. The increase was primarily driven by increases in Information systems expense as a result of new information technology (\"IT\") initiatives placed into service, Salaries and employee benefits expense, and the reserve for unfunded loan commitments within Other expense, partially offset by decreases in Restructuring expense and Professional services expense.\n\u2022AUM increased $0.3 billion, or 2%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $17.1 billion, primarily driven by favorable market returns of $1.0 billion, partially offset by $0.7 billion of negative net flows.\nPrivate

$43.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $72.2 million in 2019 and $68.0 million in 2018. The decrease from 2019 to 2020 was primarily driven by a change in Provision/(credit) for loan losses of $35.6 million and an increase in Total operating expense of $10.1 million, primarily due to increases in Information systems expense, the reserve for unfunded loan commitments within Other expense, and Salaries and employee benefits expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in Income tax expense of $12.5 million and an increase in Total revenue of $3.9 million, primarily due to higher Net interest income.\nThe increase in Net income attributable to the Company from 2018 to 2019 was primarily driven by a decrease in Total operating expense of $7.4 million, primarily due to a decrease in Restructuring expense, a decrease in Salaries and employee benefits expense, and a Provision credit for loan losses of $3.6 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in Income tax expense of $2.8 million and a decrease in Total revenue of $1.7 million, primarily due to lower Net interest income.\nTotal loans at the Bank increased $0.1 billion, or 2%, to $7.1 billion at December 31, 2020 from $7.0 billion at December 31, 2019. Total loans were 71% of Total assets at the Bank as of December 31, 2020, compared to 80% of Total assets at December 31, 2019.

the Wealth Management and Trust segment for all periods. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 3: Divestitures\u201d for additional information.\nThe Company's Wealth Management and Trust segment reported Net income attributable to the Company of $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $12.2 million in 2019 and $8.9 million in 2018. The decrease in Net income attributable to the Company from 2019 to 2020 was primarily driven by an increase in Total operating expense of $3.6 million primarily due to an increase in Salaries and employee benefits expense and a decrease in Total revenue of $3.2 million from lower fee income. The increase in Net income attributable to the Company from 2018 to 2019 was primarily driven by a decrease in Total operating expense of $8.1 million primarily due to decreases in Salaries and employee benefits expense, Information systems expense, and Restructuring expense, partially offset by a decrease in Total revenue of $3.2 million from lower fees.\nAUM increased $1.4 billion, or 9%, to $16.6 billion at December 31, 2020 from $15.2 billion at December 31, 2019. In 2020, the increase in AUM was driven by favorable market returns of $1.3 billion and positive net flows of $0.1 billion. In 2019, the $1.0 billion increase in AUM from 2018 was primarily driven by favorable market returns of $2.0 billion, partially offset by net outflows of $1.0 billion. The decrease in Total revenue of 4% from the prior year is driven primarily by a reduction in the average effective fee rate.\nAnnounced Acquisition\nAs previously announced on January 4, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with SVB pursuant to which SVB will acquire the Company. The transaction has been unanimously approved by both companies' Boards of Directors and is expected to close in mid-2021, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the receipt of customary regulatory approvals and approval by the shareholders of the Company.\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and continues to cause, substantial disruptions to the global economy and to the customers and communities that we serve. In response to the pandemic, the Company implemented business continuity contingency plans, including company-wide remote working arrangements. We are also focused on supporting our clients who may be experiencing a financial hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including by participating in the SBA's PPP and offering loan deferrals and forbearance as needed, including our Residential mortgage and Home equity line loan deferment program and Commercial and industrial loan deferment program, and creating the Commercial real estate second loan program. We will continue to evaluate this fluid situation and take additional actions as necessary.\nAdditional information regarding the effects and potential effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's business, operating results and financial condition is described in this Management Discussion and Analysis. See also Part I. Item 1. \"Business - Supervision and Regulation\" and Part I. Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" for further details.\nMortgage Deferment Program\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank initiated a Residential mortgage and Home equity line loan deferment program under which principal and interest payments on qualifying loans are generally deferred for initially three months and the loan term is extended three months; if requested, the loan may be deferred for a subsequent three months. Loans\nthat are deferred under the program are not considered TDRs or past due based on current regulatory guidance. In total, approximately 365 Residential mortgages and Home equity loans totaling approximately $220.0 million have been processed under the program. As of December 31, 2020, deferrals for approximately 300 loans totaling approximately $200.0 million have expired with the loans returning to payment, while approximately 40 loans totaling approximately $15.0 million remain in deferral under the program. Approximately 25 loans totaling approximately $5.0 million are delinquent on payment terms as of December 31, 2020 after the deferral expired, primarily First Time Home Buyer loans.\nCommercial and Industrial Loan Deferment Program\nAdditionally, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank initiated a program offering qualified Commercial and industrial borrowers principal payment deferral for six months, with the deferred principal added to the last payment. In total, approximately 85 Commercial and industrial loans totaling approximately $125.0 million have been processed under the program. As of December 31, 2020, deferrals for approximately 80 loans totaling approximately $115.0 million have expired with the loans returning to payment, while approximately five loans totaling approximately $10.0 million remain in deferral under the program. Of the loans that came off deferral, no loans are delinquent on payment terms as of December 31, 2020.\nCommercial Real Estate Second Loan Program\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank also initiated a program to offer qualifying Commercial real estate borrowers a second mortgage to cover up to one year of principal and interest payments. In order to qualify for the loan, the total exposure after receiving the second mortgage for each borrower could not exceed a 75% loan-to-value ratio, and the loans were required to be current at the time of application, amongst other conditions. In total, borrowers with approximately 240 existing loans totaling $1.3 billion requested and were approved for these second mortgages, representing approximately 50% of the Commercial real estate loan balance. As of December 31, 2020, the borrowers associated with the $1.3 billion of existing loans had an outstanding balance of approximately $72.0 million. The Company does not anticipate a material increase in the program balance of new loans in the future, and the principal balance will amortize down over the life of the loan, generally five years. In addition to, and outside of the Commercial real estate second loan program, the Bank offered qualified Commercial real estate borrowers principal payment deferral for up to 12 months, with the deferred principal added to the balance due at maturity. In total, 13 Commercial real estate borrowers with loans totaling $49.0 million accepted this accommodation. As of December 31, 2020, deferrals for 10 borrowers with loans totaling $40.3 million have expired with the loans returning to payment, while 3 borrowers with loans totaling approximately $8.7 million remain in deferral. Of the loans that came off deferral, no loans are delinquent on payment terms as of December 31, 2020. The entire Commercial real estate portfolio will continue to be monitored for credit deterioration regardless of their participation in the plan.\nCredit Quality and Provision for Loan Losses\nThe Company continues to monitor and evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the credit quality of our assets. Total criticized and classified loans as of December 31, 2020 was $318.0 million, a decrease of $4.6 million, or 1%, linked quarter, primarily driven by $39.0 million of loan payoffs, paydowns and upgrades, partially offset by $35.0 million of loan downgrades. Of the $35.0 million of downgrades in the fourth quarter of 2020, $31.0 million were Commercial real estate loans across eight relationships, primarily with retail, office, and hospitality collateral. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company recognized a total net provision credit of $5.4 million primarily driven by an improved economic forecast related to the current expected credit losses methodology, partially offset by increased qualitative reserves for Commercial real estate.\nOther Accounting Matters\nThere have been no significant changes to judgments in determining the fair value of assets or liabilities, and there have been no material impairments of financial assets. The Company will continue to monitor the fair value of assets to determine if trigger events exist to warrant further impairment testing.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCritical accounting policies reflect significant judgments and uncertainties, which could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The Company considers the accounting policies below to be its most critical accounting policies, upon which its financial condition depends and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe Allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the inherent risk of loss in the loan portfolio as of the Consolidated Balance Sheet dates. Management estimates the level of the Allowance for loan losses based on all relevant information available.\nThe Company's Allowance for loan losses is accounted for in accordance with guidance issued by various regulatory agencies, including: the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Policy Statement on the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (October 2019); SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 119 (November 2019); ASC 326, Financial Instruments \u2500 Credit Losses (\"ASC 326\"); and ASC 450, Contingencies.\nUpon the adoption of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) (\"ASU 2016-13\") on January 1, 2020, management's processes for the Allowance for loan losses has changed. The updates in this standard replace the incurred loss impairment methodology, previously accounted for in accordance with Receivables ( ASC 310\u201d) while maintaining SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 102 (July 2001), with the Current Expected Credit Losses model methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates.\nFor periods disclosed prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13 as of January 1, 2020, the Allowance for loan losses was determined under the incurred loss model. Upon the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, management's processes for the Allowance for loan losses has changed. The updates in this standard replace the incurred loss impairment methodology, previously accounted for in accordance with Receivables ( ASC 310\u201d) and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 102 (July 2001), with the updated methodology described below that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for further details.\nThe Allowance for loan losses consists of two primary components: general reserves on pass, non-impaired special mention, and substandard loans as well as specific reserves on impaired loans. The calculation of the Allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of management judgment and estimates designed to reflect the inherent risk of loss in the loan portfolio at the measurement date The Allowance for loan losses is established based upon the Company's current estimate of expected lifetime credit losses on loans measured at amortized cost.\nUnder the Current Expected Credit Losses (\"CECL\") methodology, which the Company adopted on January 1, 2020, the Company estimates credit losses on a collective basis for loans sharing similar risk characteristics using a quantitative model combined with an assessment of certain qualitative factors designed to address risks not incorporated in the quantitative model output. The quantitative model utilizes economic factors and our selected peer groups' historical default and loss experience evaluated over the historical observation period to estimate expected credit losses. The expected credit losses are the product of multiplying the Company's estimates of probability of default, net loss given default, and individual loan level exposure at default on an undiscounted basis. The model estimates expected credit losses using loan level data over the contractual life of the exposure, considering the effect of estimated prepayment and curtailment rates, both of which are derived from the Company's recent historical experience on the remaining portfolio segment balance over the life of the portfolio. Reasonable and supportable economic forecasts are incorporated into the estimate over a reasonable and supportable forecast period, beyond which is a reversion to the Company's historical long-run average of the macroeconomic variables, such as Gross Domestic Product, Unemployment, Consumer Confidence Index etc. Management has determined a reasonable and supportable period of two years and a straight line reversion period of twelve months to be appropriate for purposes of estimating expected credit losses. Management also applies a weight to the various forecasts to determine the reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. A portion of the collective Allowance for loan losses is related to the qualitative factors used to adjust historical loss information for asset-specific characteristics and current conditions to the extent they are not captured sufficiently in the quantitative model. The qualitative factors are based on information not reflected in the quantitative models but are likely to impact the measurement of estimated credit losses. The Company's qualitative assessment includes the following factors:\n\u2022 Volume and trend of past-due, non-accrual, and adversely-graded loans\n\u2022 Trends in volume and terms of loans\n\u2022 Concentration risk\n\u2022 Experience and depth of management\n\u2022 Risk surrounding lending policy and underwriting standards\n\u2022 Risk surrounding loan review\n\u2022 Banking industry conditions, other external factors, and inherent model risk\nLoans that no longer share similar risk characteristics with any pools of assets are subject to individual assessment and are removed from the collectively assessed pools to avoid double counting. For the loans that will be individually assessed, the Company will use either a discounted cash flow (\"DCF\") approach or a fair value of collateral approach. The latter approach will be used for loans deemed to be collateral dependent or when foreclosure is probable.\nThe Bank makes a determination of the applicable loss rate for these factors based on relevant local market conditions, credit quality, and portfolio mix. Each quarter, management reviews the loss factors to determine if there have been any changes in its loan portfolio, market conditions, or other risk indicators which would result in a change to the current loss factor.\nA loan is considered impaired in accordance with ASC 326 when, based upon current information and events, it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impairment is measured based on the fair value of the loan, expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest\nrate, or as a practical expedient, impairment may be determined based upon the observable market price of the loan, or the fair value of the collateral, less estimated costs to sell, if the loan is collateral dependent.\u201d A loan is collateral dependent if repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral or sale of the underlying collateral. For collateral dependent loans, appraisals are generally used to determine the fair value. When a collateral dependent loan becomes impaired, an updated appraisal of the collateral is obtained, if appropriate. Appraised values are generally discounted for factors such as the Bank's intention to liquidate the property quickly in a foreclosure sale or the date when the appraisal was performed if the Bank believes that collateral values have declined since the date the appraisal was done. The Bank may use a broker opinion of value in addition to an appraisal to validate the appraised value. In certain instances, the Bank may consider broker opinions of value as well as other qualitative factors while an appraisal is being prepared.\nIf the loan is deemed to be collateral dependent, generally the difference between the book balance (client balance less any prior charge-offs or client interest payments applied to principal) and the fair value of the collateral is taken as a partial charge-off through the Allowance for loan losses in the current period. If the loan is not determined to be collateral dependent, then a specific allocation to the general reserve is established for the difference between the book balance of the loan and the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate. Charge-offs for loans not considered to be collateral dependent are made when it is determined a loss has been incurred. Impaired loans are removed from the general loan pools. There may be instances where the loan is considered impaired although based on the fair value of underlying collateral or the discounted expected future cash flows there is no impairment to be recognized. In addition, all loans which are classified as TDRs are considered impaired.\nWhile this evaluation process utilizes historical and other objective information, the classification of loans and the establishment of the Allowance for loan losses rely to a great extent on the judgment and experience of management. While management evaluates currently available information in establishing the Allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the Allowance for loan losses may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluations. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review a financial institution's Allowance for loan losses as well as loan grades/classifications.\nChanges to the required level in the Allowance for loan losses result in either a Provision for loan losses, if an increase is required, or a Provision credit for loan losses, if a decrease is required. Loan losses are charged to the Allowance for loan losses when available information confirms that specific loans, or portions thereof, are uncollectible. Recoveries on loans previously charged-off are credited to the Allowance for loan losses when received in cash or when the Bank takes possession of other assets.\nAccrued interest receivable amounts are excluded from balances of loans held at amortized cost and are included within Accrued interest receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management has elected not to measure an Allowance for loan losses on these amounts as the Company employs a timely write-off policy as generally any loan over 89 days past-due is put on non-accrual status and any associated accrued interest is reversed.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nNet income. The Company recorded Net income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $45.2 million, compared to Net income from continuing operations of $80.4 million and $81.9 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net income attributable to the Company, which includes income from both continuing and discontinued operations, if any, less Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $45.2 million, compared to income of $80.0 million and $80.4 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe Company recognized Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $0.55 per share, compared to $0.97 per share and $0.90 per share in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Diluted earnings per share attributable to common shareholders, which includes both continuing and discontinued operations, if any, for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $0.55 per share, compared to earnings of $0.97 per share and $0.92 per share in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net income from continuing operations in 2020 and 2019 was positively impacted by decreases in the redemption value of certain redeemable noncontrolling interests, which increased income available to common shareholders. Net income from continuing operations in 2018 was partially offset by dividends paid on preferred stock, net of a decrease in the redemption value of certain redeemable noncontrolling interests. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16: Earnings Per Share\u201d for further detail on the charges made to arrive at income attributable to common shareholders.\nThe following discussions are based on the Company's continuing operations, unless otherwise stated.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\nThe following table presents selected financial

and interest paid on funding sources, primarily deposits and borrowings. Interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield earned on total interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on total interest-bearing liabilities. NIM is the amount of Net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. The average yield earned on earning assets is the amount of annualized interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities is equal to annualized interest expense as a percentage of average interest-bearing liabilities. When credit quality declines and loans are placed on nonaccrual status, NIM can decrease because the same assets are earning less income. $106.9 million of loans that were graded substandard but were still accruing interest income at December 31, 2020 could be placed on nonaccrual status if their credit quality declines further.\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $233.4 million, an increase of $5.4 million, or 2%, compared to 2019, after a decrease of $6.5 million, or 3%, from 2018 to 2019. The increase in Net interest income in 2020 was primarily driven by lower funding costs and the addition of PPP-related income, partially offset by lower interest rates on interest-earning assets. The decrease in Net interest income in 2019 was primarily driven by an increase in rates paid on deposits and borrowings, partially offset by increased yields and volumes on loans. NIM was 2.69%, 2.80%, and 2.92% for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nThe following table presents the composition of the Company's NIM for the years ended December 31,

Net interest income increased 2% from 2019 to 2020, after decreasing 3% from 2018 to 2019. The increase in Net interest income in 2020 was primarily driven by lower funding costs and the addition of PPP-related income, partially offset by lower interest on interest-earning assets. The decrease in Net interest income in 2019 was primarily driven by an increase in the average rate paid on deposits, partially offset by higher yields and higher average balances of loans, and a decrease in the average balance of borrowings. These changes are discussed in more detail below.\nThe Company's NIM decreased 11 basis points to 2.69% in 2020 from 2.80% in 2019, after decreasing 12 basis points in 2019 from 2.92% in 2018. Although Net interest income increased, the decrease in the Company's Net interest margin in 2020 was driven primarily by lower yields on interest-earning assets and higher volumes of interest-earning assets, primarily excess cash balances held at lower rates, partially offset by lower funding costs. The decrease in the Company's NIM in 2019 was primarily driven by the increased cost of deposits and borrowings, partially offset by higher yields on the loan portfolio and interest recoveries on previously nonaccrual loans as loan yields increased at a slower rate than deposits and borrowings.\nTotal interest and dividend income. Total interest and dividend income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $273.7 million, a decrease of $34.7 million, or 11%, compared to 2019, after an increase of $15.5 million, or 5%, in 2019 from 2018. The 2020 decrease was primarily driven by lower yields on loans and cash and investments, partially offset by the addition of PPP loans and higher volume of cash and investments. The 2019 increase was primarily driven by higher yields on investments and loans and higher volume of loans, partially offset by lower volume of investments.\nThe Bank generally has interest income that is either recovered or reversed related to nonaccruing loans each quarter. Based on the net amount recovered or reversed, the impact on interest income and related yields can be either positive or negative. In addition, the Bank collects prepayment penalties on certain Commercial loans that pay off prior to maturity which could also impact interest income and related yields positively. The amount and timing of prepayment penalties varies.\nInterest income on Commercial and industrial loans (including Commercial loans and Commercial tax-exempt loans), for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $37.3 million, a decrease of $7.7 million, or 17%, compared to 2019, after an increase of $7.0 million, or 18%, in 2019 from 2018. The 2020 decrease was primarily driven by a 58 basis point decrease in average yield and a 3% decrease in the average balance. The 2019 increase was primarily driven by a 12% increase in the average balance and a 22 basis point increase in average yield. The 2020 decrease in the average yield was primarily the result of decreases to the interest rate benchmarks to which the variable rate loans are tied and lower yields on loan originations. The 2019 change in the average yield was primarily driven by the impact of the timing of benchmark interest rate increases in 2018 compared to the timing of benchmark interest rate cuts in 2019. The 2020 decrease in the average balance was related primarily\nto lower revolving line of credit usage. The 2019 increase in the average balance was primarily driven by organic growth, primarily in the New England region.\nInterest income on PPP loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $7.8 million. The Company\nbegan earning interest income on PPP loans in the second quarter of 2020. Interest income on PPP loans includes interest earned on the loans and the accretion of origination fees over the life of the loans. If a loan is forgiven or otherwise paid off, the remainder of the processing fee will be accreted through Net interest income. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $62.2 million of loans were forgiven by the SBA, and a total of $5.1 million was accreted through Net interest income.\nInterest income on Commercial real estate loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $99.7 million, a decrease of $15.8 million, or 14%, compared to 2019, after increasing $3.5 million, or 3%, in 2019 from 2018.

The 2019 increase was primarily driven by a 6 basis point increase in average yield and a 2% increase in average balance. The 2020 decrease in the average yield was primarily the result of decreases to the interest rate benchmarks to which the variable rate loans are tied and lower yields on loan originations. The 2019 increase in the average yield was primarily driven by the impact of the timing of benchmark interest rate increases in 2018 compared to the timing of benchmark interest rate cuts in 2019. The 2020 increase in the average balance was related primarily to the addition of approximately $80.0 million of loans under the Commercial real estate second loan program in the second quarter of 2020 as part of the relief measures provided to clients as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2019 increase in the average balance was primarily driven by organic growth, primarily in the Southern California and Northern California regions.\nInterest income on Construction and land loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $8.6 million, a decrease of $1.6 million, or 16%, compared to 2019, after increasing $1.5 million, or 18%, in 2019 from 2018. The 2020 decrease was primarily driven by a 94 basis point decrease in average yield, partially offset by a 4% increase in average balance. The 2019 increase was primarily driven by a 14% increase in average balance and a 12 basis point increase in average yield. The 2020 decrease in the average yield was primarily the result of decreases to the interest rate benchmarks to which the variable rate loans are tied.

The 2020 increase in the average balance was related primarily to line drawdowns, primarily in Southern California. The 2019 increase in average balance was primarily driven by organic fluctuations in a small number of large balance loans which show as large percentage changes given the relative size of the total loan balance.\nInterest income on Residential mortgage loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $89.7 million, a decrease of $11.4 million, or 11%, compared to 2019, after increasing $8.2 million, or 9%, in 2019 from 2018. The 2020 decrease was primarily driven by a 20 basis point decrease in average yield and a 6% decrease in average balance. The 2019 increase was primarily driven by a 6% increase in average balance and an 8 basis point increase in average yield. The 2020 decrease in the average yield was primarily the result of decreases to the interest rate benchmarks to which the variable rate loans are tied and lower yields on loan originations. The 2019 increase in the average yield was primarily driven by new loans being originated at higher interest rates. The 2020 decrease in the average balance was primarily driven by the sale of approximately $72.0 million of Residential loans in the third quarter of 2020. The 2019 increase in the average balance was primarily driven by organic growth of the Residential loan portfolio, specifically in the New England and Southern California markets, partially offset by the sale of $190.7 million of Residential loans in 2019.\nInterest income on Home equity loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2.9 million, a decrease of $1.5 million, or 33%, compared to 2019, after remaining flat in 2019 from 2018.

The 2020 decrease in the average yield was primarily the result of decreases to the interest rate benchmarks to which the variable rate loans are tied. The 2019 increase in the average yield was primarily driven by the impact of the timing of benchmark interest rate increases in 2018 compared to the timing of benchmark interest rate cuts in 2019. The 2020 decrease in the average balance was primarily driven by reduced demand as a result of economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2019 decrease in the average balance was primarily due to decreases in client demand given the increase in interest rates as the loans are lines of credit.\nInterest income on Other consumer loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $3.2 million, a decrease of $2.3 million, or 42%, compared to 2019, after also decreasing $1.1 million, or 17%, in 2019 from 2018. The 2020 decrease was primarily the result of a 162 basis point decrease in the average yield and a 6% decrease in the average balance. The 2019 decrease was primarily the result of a 22% decrease in the average balance, partially offset by a 28 basis point increase in the average yield. The 2020 decrease in the average yield was primarily the result of decreases to the interest rate benchmarks to which the variable rate loans are tied. The 2019 increase in the average yield was primarily driven by the impact of the timing of benchmark interest rate increases in 2018 compared to the timing of benchmark interest rate cuts in 2019. The 2020 decrease in the average balance was primarily driven by a strategic decision to slow new consumer loan growth. The 2019 decrease in average balance was primarily due to changes in client demand.\nInvestment income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $24.7 million, a decrease of $2.2 million, or 8%, compared to 2019, after also decreasing $3.5 million, or 12%, in 2019 from 2018. The 2020 decrease was the result of a 71 basis point decrease in the average yield, partially offset by a 31% increase in the average balance. The 2019 decrease was the result of a 16% decrease in the average balance, partially offset by an 11 basis point increase in the average yield. The decrease in the average yield in 2020 was primarily due to the lower interest rate environment. The increase in the average yield in 2019 was primarily driven by increases in the federal discount rate and higher dividends paid on FHLB stock. The increase in Total cash and investments average balance in 2020 was primarily due to additional cash from higher client deposit balances. The decrease in Total cash and investments average balance in 2019 was primarily driven by the use of investment and other cash flows to fund loan growth instead of reinvesting in additional investment securities in response to a flattening yield curve.\nTotal interest expense. Total interest expense on deposits and borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $40.3 million, a decrease of $40.1 million, or 50%, compared to 2019, after increasing $22.0 million, or 38%, in 2019 from 2018.\nInterest expense on deposits for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $32.0 million, a decrease of $27.1 million, or 46%, compared to 2019, after increasing $19.2 million, or 48%, in 2019 from 2018. The 2020 decrease was primarily driven by a 64 basis point decrease in average rate paid on deposits, partially offset by a 12% increase in the average balance of total deposits. The 2019 increase was primarily driven by a 38 basis point increase in average rate paid on deposits and a 4% increase in the average balance of total deposits. The decrease in the average yield in 2020 was primarily driven by wholesale reductions in rates paid for deposit accounts given decreases in interest rates as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in the average yield in 2019 was primarily driven by the increase in rates in 2018, which carry forward for much of 2019, impacting all deposit types, specifically Money market deposits and Certificates of deposits, and was primarily driven by increases to market interest rates. The 2020 increase in the average balance was driven by an increase in new and existing client deposits primarily in Money market and NOW accounts, partially offset by a decrease in Certificates of deposits. The 2019 increase in the average balance was driven by increases to Money market deposits and Certificates of deposit accounts.\nInterest paid on borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $8.3 million, a decrease of $13.0 million, or 61%, compared to 2019, after increasing $2.8 million, or 15%, in 2019 from 2018. The 2020 decrease was primarily the result of a 144 basis point decrease in average rate paid on Junior subordinated debentures, a 98 basis point decrease in average rate paid on FHLB borrowings, and a 43% decrease in the average balance of FHLB borrowings and other. The average rate paid on FHLB borrowings is affected by both the yield and the structure or term of the borrowing. The 2019 increase was primarily the result of a 45 basis point increase in average rate paid on FHLB borrowings and a 25 basis point increase in the average rate paid on Junior subordinated debentures, partially offset by a 6% decrease in average balance of FHLB borrowings and other. The 2020 decrease in the average rates paid was primarily driven by the decreases in benchmark interest rates to which the instruments are tied. The 2019 increase in average rates paid were the result of increases in market interest rates. The 2020 decrease in the average balance for FHLB borrowings and other was primarily driven by the repayment of FHLB borrowings in 2020, as the increase in deposits was used to pay down higher cost borrowings.\nDiscussion of Noninterest Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\nProvision/(credit) for loan losses. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Provision/(credit) for loan losses was an expense of $32.0 million, compared to credits of $3.6 million and $2.2 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The 2020 Provision for loan losses was primarily driven by the change in Allowance for loan losses methodology from the incurred loss model to the current expected credit loss model, the current reasonable and supportable economic forecast deterioration as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the net change in qualitative factors to account for risks and assumptions related to our loan portfolio not incorporated in the forecasts. The 2019 credit to the Provision for loan losses was primarily driven by a net decrease in criticized and classified loans and an improvement in loss factors, partially offset by loan growth and a change in loan mix and loan volume. The 2018 credit to the provision for loan losses was primarily driven by net recoveries, an improvement in loss factors, and a decrease in criticized loans, partially offset by loan growth and the composition of the loan portfolio.\nThe Provision/(credit) for loan losses is determined as a result of the required level of the Allowance for loan losses, estimated by management, which reflects the inherent risk of loss in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet dates. The Company estimates credit losses on a collective basis for loans sharing similar risk characteristics using a quantitative model combined with an assessment of certain qualitative factors designed to address forecast risk and model risk inherent in the quantitative model output. The quantitative model utilizes a factor-based approach to estimate expected credit losses using probability of default and loss given default, which are derived from a selected peer group's historical default and loss experience. The model estimates expected credit losses using loan level data over the contractual life of the exposure, considering the effect of prepayments and curtailments. Economic forecasts are incorporated into the estimate over a reasonable and supportable forecast period, beyond which is a reversion to the Company's historical long-run average. Qualitative factors are estimated by management and include trends in problem loans, strength of management, concentration risk and underwriting standards. For further details, see Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Loan Portfolio and Credit Quality\u201d below. For periods disclosed prior to the adoption of ASU\n2016-13 as of January 1, 2020, the Allowance for loan losses was determined under the incurred loss model. Refer to Part II. Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" for a description of the methodology.\nTotal fees and other income. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Total fees and other income was $93.9 million, a decrease of $7.7 million, or 8%, from the same period in 2019, compared to a decrease of $48.5 million, or 32%, from 2018 to 2019. The 2020 decrease was primarily driven by decreases in Investment management fees and Wealth management and trust fees. The 2019 decrease was primarily driven by the sales of Anchor and BOS in 2018 decreasing Investment management fees and Wealth management and trust fees, and the $18.1 million gain on the sale of BOS in 2018.\nWealth management and trust fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $72.9 million, a decrease of $2.9 million, or 4%, from the same period in 2019, compared to a decrease of $24.1 million, or 24%, from 2018 to 2019. AUM in the Wealth Management and Trust segment increased $1.4 billion, or 9%, to $16.6 billion at December 31, 2020 from $15.2 billion at December 31, 2019. The AUM increase in 2020 was the result of favorable market returns of $1.3 billion and net inflows of $0.1 billion. The decrease in Wealth management and trust fees in 2020 was driven primarily by a reduction in the average effective fee rate. Fee income from BOS is included within Wealth management and trust fees for the period BOS was owned. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for additional information on the reporting of historical results for Anchor and BOS.\nInvestment management fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $6.3 million, a decrease of $3.9 million, or 38%, from the same period in 2019, compared to a decrease of $11.6 million, or 53%, from 2018 to 2019. The decrease in revenue in 2020 was primarily driven by negative net flows at DGHM. The decrease in revenue in 2019 was primarily driven by the sale of Anchor in the second quarter of 2018 and a decrease in fee income at DGHM.\nGain on sale of affiliate for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was zero, compared to a gain of $18.1 million in 2018. As discussed above, the gain of $18.1 million in 2018 relates to the sale of BOS. There were no sales of affiliates in 2020 or 2019.\nOther income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2.2 million, a decrease of $0.8 million, or 26%, from the same period in 2019, compared to an increase of $2.1 million, from 2018 to 2019. The decrease in 2020 was primarily driven by the impact of the market value adjustment on derivatives and the value of the rabbi trust securities related to the Company's deferred compensation plan, partially offset by an increase in miscellaneous income primarily due to the addition of servicing rights related to the Residential loan sales in the third quarter of 2020 and the Federal Reserve's Main Street Lending Program. The increase in 2019 was primarily driven by an increase in the value of the rabbi trust securities related to the Company's deferred compensation plan and an increase in miscellaneous income.\nTotal operating expense. Total operating expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $241.3 million, an increase of $11.1 million, or 5%, from the same period in 2019, compared to a decrease of $37.1 million, or 14%, from 2018 to 2019. The increase in 2020 was primarily driven by increases in Information systems expense, Salaries and employee benefits expense, and the reserve for unfunded loan commitments within Other expense, partially offset by decreases in Restructuring expense, Professional services expense, and Occupancy and equipment expense. The decrease in 2019 was primarily driven by the impact of the sales of Anchor and BOS, lower Salaries and employee benefits expense, and lower Information systems expense. See below for additional information on expense drivers.\nSalaries and employee benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $139.7 million, an increase of $5.4 million, or 4%, from the same period in 2019, compared to a decrease of $27.2 million, or 17%, from 2018 to 2019. The increase in 2020 was driven primarily by an increase in salaries due to new hires in line with our strategic objectives. The decrease in 2019 was driven primarily by the impact of the sales of Anchor and BOS as well as realized savings from previously-enacted efficiency initiatives.\nOccupancy and equipment expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $31.1 million, a decrease of $1.0 million, or 3%, from the same period in 2019, compared to a decrease of $0.1 million, or flat, from 2018 to 2019. The decrease in 2020 was primarily driven by decreases in amortization expense on Right-of use assets and depreciation expense on leasehold improvements due to lease expirations that were not renewed in 2020. The decrease in 2019 was due to fully depreciated leasehold improvements and a gain on lease modifications, partially offset by an increase in rent expense related to new office locations.\nInformation systems expense consists of contract servicing, computer hardware and software charges, and technology service agreements. Information systems expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $29.6 million, an increase of $6.9 million, or 31%, from the same period in 2019, compared to a decrease of $2.5 million, or 10%, from 2018 to 2019. The increase in 2020 was primarily driven by information technology initiatives placed into service and an increase in costs related to building out remote working capabilities in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in 2019 was primarily due to lower telecommunications expense as a result of previously-enacted efficiency initiatives and the impact of the sales of Anchor and BOS, partially offset by an increase in technology service agreements related to new technology initiatives.\nProfessional services expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $13.8 million, a decrease of $1.4 million, or 9%, from the same period in 2019, compared to an increase of $2.1 million, or 16%, from 2018 to 2019. The 2020 decrease was primarily driven by lower consulting fees. The 2019 increase was primarily driven by higher information technology consulting fees related to the implementation of technology initiatives, partially offset by lower recruitment expense.\nMarketing and business development expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $6.3 million, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 2%, from the same period in 2019, compared to a decrease of $1.2 million, or 16%, from 2018 to 2019.

The 2019 decrease was primarily driven by lower travel and business development expenses.\nFDIC insurance expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2.6 million, an increase of $1.3 million, from the same period in 2019, compared to a decrease of $1.6 million, or 55%, from 2018 to 2019. The 2020 increase was driven by the expiration of an FDIC insurance assessment credit received in the third quarter of 2019. The credit was utilized in full by the first quarter of 2020 and the Bank had resumed paying FDIC insurance for the remainder of 2020. The 2019 decrease was driven by $1.4 million of credits received by the Bank for its FDIC insurance premiums. In January 2019, the Bank received notification from the FDIC that it was eligible for small bank assessment credits of $2.0 million because the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio reserve ratio exceeded the target level.\nRestructuring expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was zero, compared to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as part of an efficiency program guided by a focus on improving operating efficiency and sustained earnings enhancement. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2: Restructuring\u201d for further detail.\nOther expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $15.5 million, an increase of $1.6 million, or 11%, from the same period in 2019, compared to a decrease of $0.2 million, or 2%, from 2018 to 2019. The 2020 increase in Other expense was primarily driven by an increase to the reserve for unfunded loan commitments. The overall change in the reserve was driven by a change in Allowance for loan losses methodology, an increase in the reserve ratios as a result of the current reasonable and supportable economic forecasts due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and an increase in the balance of loan commitments. The 2019 decrease in Other expense was primarily driven by lower operational losses and other miscellaneous expense.\nIncome tax expense. Income tax expense for continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $8.9 million, a decrease of $13.7 million, or 61%, from the same period in 2019, compared to a decrease of $14.9 million, or 40%, from 2018 to 2019. The effective tax rate for continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 16.4%, compared to effective tax rates of 21.9% and 31.4% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2020 was lower than 2019 primarily due to the lower level of income in 2020 as compared to 2019. The effective tax rate for 2019 was lower than 2018 primarily due to the Income tax expense related to the Anchor transaction closing in 2018. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 17: Income Taxes\u201d for further detail.\nNet income from discontinued operations. Net income from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was zero. The Company received its final quarterly payment from a revenue sharing agreement from Westfield in the first quarter of 2018. When the Company filed its 2017 federal tax return in the fourth quarter of 2018, there was also an adjustment to deferred taxes related to the Westfield revenue share, which resulted in an additional tax credit recorded to Net income from discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nFinancial Condition\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and Discussion\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>$\nChange </td> <td> </td> <td>%\nChange </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assets: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash and investments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,404,619 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,376,863 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,027,756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans held for sale </td> <td>17,421 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,386 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,035 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>nm </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loans </td> <td>7,104,309 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,976,704 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>127,605 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Allowance for loan losses </td> <td>81,238 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71,982 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,256 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loans </td> <td>7,023,071 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,904,722 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>118,349 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill and intangible assets, net </td> <td>66,663 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,959 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,296) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Right-of-use assets </td> <td>97,859 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>102,075 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,216) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other assets </td> <td>439,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>371,496 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,604 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total assets </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,048,733 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,830,501 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,218,232 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liabilities and Equity: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposits </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,595,366 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,241,476 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,353,890 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total borrowings </td> <td>274,494 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>510,590 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(236,096) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(46) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease liabilities </td> <td>112,339 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>117,214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,875) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other liabilities </td> <td>198,526 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>140,820 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57,706 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liabilities </td> <td>9,180,725 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,010,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,170,625 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Redeemable noncontrolling interests </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,383 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,383) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total shareholders' equity </td> <td>868,008 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>819,018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,990 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liabilities, redeemable noncontrolling interests and shareholders' equity </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,048,733 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,830,501 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,218,232 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\nnm - not meaningful\nTotal assets. Total assets increased $1.2 billion, or 14%, to $10.0 billion at December 31, 2020 from $8.8 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in client deposits in 2020 which generated additional liquidity.\nCash and investments. Total cash and investments (consisting of Cash and cash equivalents, Investment securities available-for-sale, Investment securities held-to-maturity, Equity securities at fair value, and Stock in the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank) increased $1.0 billion, or 75%, to $2.4 billion, or 24% of Total assets at December 31, 2020 from $1.4 billion, or 16% of Total assets at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in Cash and cash equivalents of $0.8 billion, an increase in Investment securities available-for-sale of $265.4 million, or 27%, and an increase in Equity securities of $22.6 million, partially offset by a decrease in Investment securities held-to-maturity securities of $13.0 million, or 27%, and a decrease in FHLB stock of $10.4 million, or 27%. The increase in Cash and investments was driven by an increase in client deposits throughout the year which were primarily invested in cash and investment securities.\nThe majority of the investments held by the Company are held by the Bank. The Bank's investment policy requires management to maintain a portfolio of securities which will provide liquidity necessary to facilitate funding of loans, to cover deposit fluctuations, and to mitigate the Bank's overall balance sheet exposure to interest rate risk, while at the same time earning a satisfactory return on the funds invested. The securities in which the Bank may invest are subject to regulation and are generally limited to securities that are considered investment grade.\u201d\nInvestment securities available-for-sale and Investment securities held-to-maturity maturities, calls, principal payments, and sales, if any, net of purchases of investment securities used $227.8 million of cash during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $66.1 million of cash generated for the year ended December 31, 2019. Equity securities investment sales, net of investment purchases decreased cash by $22.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a decrease in cash of $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Proceeds from investment securities are generally used to fund a portion of loan growth, pay down borrowings or purchase new investments. The timing of sales and reinvestments is based on various factors, including management's evaluation of interest rate trends, credit risk, and the Company's liquidity. The Company's portfolio of Investment securities available-for-sale carried a total of $45.8 million of unrealized gains and $0.6 million of unrealized losses at December 31, 2020, compared to $15.0 million of unrealized gains and $3.6 million of unrealized losses at December 31, 2019. For information regarding the weighted average yield and maturity of investments, see Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4: Investment Securities.\u201d\nNo impairment losses were recognized through earnings related to investment securities during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The amount of investment securities in an unrealized loss position greater than 12 months, as well as the total amount of unrealized losses, was primarily due to changes in interest rates since the securities were purchased and not due to credit quality or other risk factors.\nThe Company had no intent to sell any securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2020, and it was not more likely than not that the Company would be forced to sell any of these securities prior to the full recovery of all unrealized losses.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's carrying value of Investment securities available-for-sale, Investment securities held-to-maturity, and Equity securities at fair value as of the dates indicated:\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment securities available-for-sale at fair value:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. government and agencies </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,984 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,940 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Government-sponsored entities </td> <td>147,786 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>156,255 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Municipal bonds </td> <td>346,588 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>325,455 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage-backed securities (1) </td> <td>728,335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>476,634 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,243,693 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>978,284 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment securities held-to-maturity at amortized cost:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage-backed securities (1) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,223 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48,212 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,223 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48,212 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity securities at fair value: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Money market mutual funds </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,452 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,810 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,452 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,810 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________\n(1)All Mortgage-backed securities are guaranteed by the U.S. government, U.S. government agencies, or government-sponsored entities.\nLoans held for sale. Loans held for sale increased $10.0 million to $17.4 million at December 31, 2020 from $7.4 million at December 31, 2019. The balance of Loans held for sale relates to the timing and volume of Residential loans originated for sale and the ultimate sale transaction, which is typically executed within a short period of time following the loan origination.\nGoodwill and intangible assets, net. Goodwill and intangible assets, net decreased $1.3 million, or 2%, to $66.7 million at December 31, 2020 from $68.0 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by the Amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by an increase in the addition of servicing rights of $1.4 million. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 8: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d for a discussion of the annual goodwill impairment testing.\nGoodwill is subject to annual impairment testing, or more frequently, if there is indication of impairment, based on guidance in ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. Long-lived intangible assets such as advisory contracts are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment ( ASC 360\u201d).\nManagement performed its annual goodwill impairment testing during the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019 for the Wealth Management and Trust reporting unit. Based on the qualitative assessments, there was no indication of impairment. For information regarding the 2020 goodwill impairment testing, see Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 8: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.\u201d\nOther assets. Other assets consisting of Premises and equipment, net; Fees receivable; Accrued interest receivable; Deferred income taxes, net; Right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets; and Other assets, increased $63.4 million, or 13%, to $537.0 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $473.6 million at December 31, 2019.\nDeferred income taxes, net, decreased $4.6 million, or 40%, to $6.8 million at December 31, 2020 from $11.4 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the current year tax effect of Other comprehensive income of $9.5 million and the tax effect of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 of $5.5 million, partially offset by the deferred tax benefit of $10.4 million which was primarily related to the additional Allowance for loan losses. At December 31, 2020, no valuation\nallowance on the net deferred tax asset was required primarily due to the ability to generate future taxable income. The Company does not have any capital losses in excess of capital gains as of December 31, 2020.\nOther assets, which consist primarily of Bank-owned life insurance ( BOLI\u201d), prepaid expenses, investment in partnerships, interest rate derivatives, cash collateral, and other receivables, increased $71.9 million, or 25%, to $359.2 million at December 31, 2020 from $287.3 million at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the market value adjustment to derivative assets, an increase in cash collateral, and an increase to the investment in partnerships.\nROU assets at December 31, 2020 decreased $4.2 million, or 4%, to $97.9 million at December 31, 2020 from $102.1 million at December 31, 2019 due to amortization of ROU assets, lease expirations that were not renewed, and lease modifications, partially offset by the addition of real estate leases and equipment leases during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Upon adoption of the lease accounting standard, ASU 2016-02, the Company recognized $108.5 million of ROU assets on the face of the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 1, 2019. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7: Premises, Equipment, and Leases.\u201d\nDeposits. Deposits increased $1.4 billion, or 19%, to $8.6 billion, at December 31, 2020 from $7.2 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase was driven by increased deposits from new and existing clients throughout the year. Deposits are the principal source of the Bank's funds for use in lending, investments, and liquidity. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10: Deposits\u201d for further information.\nThe following table summarizes the average balances and interest rates paid on the Bank's deposits:\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Balance </td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted Average Rate </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest-bearing deposits: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Checking accounts </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,266,801 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest bearing deposits: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Savings and NOW </td> <td>709,357 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.12 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Money market </td> <td>4,014,481 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.59 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Certificates of deposit </td> <td>611,829 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.25 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest bearing deposits </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,335,667 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.60 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total deposits </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,602,468 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.42 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCertificates of deposit in denominations of $100,000 or greater had the following schedule of maturities:\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less than 3 months remaining </td> <td>$ </td> <td>155,887 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>223,122 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3 to 6 months remaining </td> <td>110,210 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>128,731 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6 to 12 months remaining </td> <td>180,646 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>133,757 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>More than 12 months remaining </td> <td>31,104 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,097 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>477,847 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>509,707 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBorrowings. Total borrowings, which consists of Securities sold under agreements to repurchase; Federal funds purchased, if any; FHLB borrowings; and Junior subordinated debentures, decreased $236.1 million, or 46%, to $274.5 million at December 31, 2020 from $510.6 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by the use of deposits to pay down higher cost borrowings.\nRepurchase agreements increased $0.1 million to $53.5 million at December 31, 2020 from $53.4 million at December 31, 2019. Repurchase agreements are generally linked to Commercial demand deposit accounts with an overnight sweep feature.\nFrom time to time, the Company purchases Federal funds from the FHLB and other banking institutions to supplement its liquidity position. The Company had no outstanding Federal funds purchased at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. FHLB borrowings decreased $236.2 million, or 67%, to $114.7 million at December 31, 2020 from $350.8 million at December 31, 2019. FHLB borrowings are generally used to provide additional funding for loan growth when the rate of loan growth exceeds deposit growth and to manage interest rate risk, but can also be used as an additional source of liquidity for the Bank. Given the higher deposits and cash balances at December 31, 2020, there was less need for additional liquidity from the purchase of Federal funds or FHLB borrowings. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company used additional liquidity to pay down $61.5 million of long-term FHLB borrowings, thereby incurring FHLB prepayment penalties of $0.4 million.\nOther liabilities. Other liabilities, which consist primarily of accrued interest, accrued compensation, interest rate derivatives, other accrued expenses, and Lease liabilities, increased $52.8 million, or 20%, to $310.9 million at December 31, 2020 from $258.0 million at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the market value adjustment to derivative liabilities.\nLease liabilities decreased $4.9 million, or 4%, to $112.3 million at December 31, 2020 from $117.2 million at December 31, 2019 due to lease payments, and lease modifications, partially offset by the addition of new or renewed real estate leases and new equipment leases during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Upon adoption of the lease accounting standard discussed above, the Company recognized $124.1 million of Lease liabilities on the face of the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 1, 2019. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7: Premises, Equipment, and Leases.\u201d\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests. Redeemable noncontrolling interests decreased $1.4 million, or 100%, at December 31, 2020 from the balance at December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to fair value adjustments made throughout 2020 to the estimated maximum redemption value of the Company's sole majority-owned affiliate, DGHM.\nLoan Portfolio and Credit Quality\nLoans. Total portfolio loans increased $127.6 million, or 2%, to $7.1 billion, or 71% of total assets, at December 31, 2020, from $7.0 billion, or 79% of total assets, at December 31, 2019.

Loans made by the Bank to individuals may include Residential mortgage loans and mortgage loans on investment or vacation properties, unsecured and secured personal lines of credit, home equity loans, and overdraft protection. Loans made by the Bank to businesses include commercial and mortgage loans, revolving lines of credit, working capital loans, equipment financing, community lending programs, and construction and land loans. The types and sizes of loans the Bank originates are limited by regulatory requirements.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2020, the Company made a change to the loan portfolio segmentation in which\nCommercial and industrial and Commercial tax-exempt loans were bifurcated given their different underlying risk\ncharacteristics. Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, the Company also added a segment for PPP loans originated. For the\nperiod ended December 31, 2019 there were no such loans as the SBA initiated the program in the first quarter of 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Bank's loans are affected by the economic and real estate markets in which they are located. Generally, Commercial real estate, and Construction and land loans are affected more than Residential mortgage loans in an economic downturn. The ability to grow the loan portfolio is partially related to the Bank's ability to increase deposit levels. If, as a result of general economic conditions, market interest rates, competitive pressures, or otherwise, the amount of deposits at the Bank decreases, the Bank may be limited in its ability to grow its loan portfolio or may have to rely more heavily on higher cost borrowings as a source of funds in the future. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Bank sold $72.0 million of Residential mortgage loans driven by Asset-Liability Management (\"ALM\") consideration and anticipated deposit levels.\nThe Bank's Commercial real estate loan portfolio, the largest portfolio segment after Residential mortgage loans, includes loans secured by the following types of collateral as of the dates indicated:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Multifamily and residential investment </td> <td>$ </td> <td>982,128 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>899,583 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Retail </td> <td>593,440 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>631,796 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Office and medical </td> <td>562,805 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>487,133 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Manufacturing, industrial, and warehouse </td> <td>261,083 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>223,913 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Hospitality </td> <td>173,741 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>145,195 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Other </td> <td>184,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>163,654 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,757,375 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,551,274 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeographic concentration.

Commercial and industrial loans include working capital and revolving lines of credit, term loans for equipment and fixed assets, and SBA loans.\nPaycheck Protection Program. PPP loans are loans made under the PPP as stipulated through the CARES Act.\nCommercial tax-exempt loans. Commercial tax-exempt loans include loans to not-for-profit private schools, colleges, and public charter schools.\nCommercial real estate loans. Commercial real estate loans are generally acquisition financing for commercial properties such as office buildings, retail properties, apartment buildings, and industrial/warehouse space. In addition, tax-exempt Commercial real estate loans are provided for affordable housing development and rehabilitation. These loans are often supplemented with federal, state, and/or local subsidies.\nConstruction and land loans. Construction and land loans include loans for financing of new developments as well as financing for improvements to existing buildings. In addition, tax-exempt construction and land loans are provided for the construction phase of the Commercial tax-exempt and Commercial real estate tax-exempt loans described above.\nResidential loans. While the Bank has no minimum size for mortgage loans, it concentrates its origination activities in the Jumbo\u201d segment of the market. This segment consists of loans secured by single-family and one- to four-unit properties in excess of the amount eligible for purchase by the Federal National Mortgage Association, which was $510 thousand at December 31, 2020 for the General\u201d limit and $766 thousand for single-family properties for the High-Cost\u201d limit, depending on from which specific geographic region of the Bank's primary market areas the loan originated. The majority of the Bank's Residential loan portfolio, including jumbo mortgage loans, is adjustable rate mortgages (\"ARMs\"). The ARM loans the Bank originates generally have a fixed interest rate for the first three to ten years and then adjust annually based on a market index such as U.S. Treasury or LIBOR yields. ARM loans may negatively impact the Bank's interest income when they reprice if yields on U.S. Treasuries or LIBOR are lower than the yields at the time of origination. If rates reset higher, the Bank could see increased delinquencies if clients' ability to make payments is impacted by the higher payments.\nHome equity loans. Home equity loans consist of balances outstanding on second mortgages and home equity lines of credit extended to individual clients. The amount of Home equity loans typically depends on client demand.\nConsumer and other loans. Consumer and other loans consist of balances outstanding on consumer loans including personal lines of credit, and loans arising from overdraft protection extended to individual and business clients. Personal lines of credit are typically for high net worth clients whose assets may not be liquid due to investments, closely held stock or restricted stock. The amount of Consumer and other loans typically depends on client demand.\nThe following tables disclose the scheduled contractual maturities of portfolio loans by class of receivable at December 31, 2020. Loans having no stated maturity are reported as due in one year or less. The following tables also set forth the dollar amounts of loans that are scheduled to mature after one year segregated between fixed and adjustable interest rate loans.\nTable 26: <table><tr><td>

maturities typically do not reflect the actual maturities of loans. The average maturity of loans is substantially less than their average contractual terms because of prepayments, curtailments and, in the case of conventional mortgage loans, due on sale clauses, which generally give the Bank the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event, among other things, that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage. The average life of mortgage loans tends to increase when current market rates are substantially higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and decrease when current market rates are substantially lower than rates on existing mortgages (due to refinancing of adjustable-rate and fixed-rate loans at lower rates). Under the latter circumstances, the weighted average yield on loans decreases as higher yielding loans are repaid or refinanced at lower rates. In addition, due to the likelihood that the Bank will, consistent with industry practice, rollover\u201d a significant portion of Commercial real estate and Commercial loans at or immediately prior to their maturity by renewing credit on substantially similar or revised terms, the principal repayments actually received by the Bank are anticipated to be significantly less than the amounts contractually due in any particular period. A portion of such loans also may not be repaid due to the borrower's inability to satisfy the contractual obligations of the loan.\nThe interest rates charged on loans vary with the degree of risk, maturity, and amount of the loan and are further subject to competitive pressures, market rates, the availability of funds, and legal and regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2020, approximately 60% of the Bank's outstanding loans due after one year had interest rates that were either floating or adjustable in nature. See Part II.", "item_7_truncated": "FDIC insurance expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2.6 million, an increase of $1.3 million, from the same period in 2019, compared to a decrease of $1.6 million, or 55%, from 2018 to 2019. The 2020 increase was driven by the expiration of an FDIC insurance assessment credit received in the third quarter of 2019. The credit was utilized in full by the first quarter of 2020 and the Bank had resumed paying FDIC insurance for the remainder of 2020. The 2019 decrease was driven by $1.4 million of credits received by the Bank for its FDIC insurance premiums. In January 2019, the Bank received notification from the FDIC that it was eligible for small bank assessment credits of $2.0 million because the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio reserve ratio exceeded the target level.\nProfessional services expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $13.8 million, a decrease of $1.4 million, or 9%, from the same period in 2019, compared to an increase of $2.1 million, or 16%, from 2018 to 2019. The 2020 decrease was primarily driven by lower consulting fees. The 2019 increase was primarily driven by higher information technology consulting fees related to the implementation of technology initiatives, partially offset by lower recruitment expense.\nTable

Net income from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was zero. The Company received its final quarterly payment from a revenue sharing agreement from Westfield in the first quarter of 2018. When the Company filed its 2017 federal tax return in the fourth quarter of 2018, there was also an adjustment to deferred taxes related to the Westfield revenue share, which resulted in an additional tax credit recorded to Net income from discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nScheduled contractual maturities typically do not reflect the actual maturities of loans. The average maturity of loans is substantially less than their average contractual terms because of prepayments, curtailments and, in the case of conventional mortgage loans, due on sale clauses, which generally give the Bank the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event, among other things, that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage. The average life of mortgage loans tends to increase when current market rates are substantially higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and decrease when current market rates are substantially lower than rates on existing mortgages (due to refinancing of adjustable-rate and fixed-rate loans at lower rates). Under the latter circumstances, the weighted average yield on loans decreases as higher yielding loans are repaid or refinanced at lower rates. In addition, due to the likelihood that the Bank will, consistent with industry practice, rollover\u201d a significant portion of Commercial real estate and Commercial loans at or immediately prior to their maturity by renewing credit on substantially similar or revised terms, the principal repayments actually received by the Bank are anticipated to be significantly less than the amounts contractually due in any particular period. A portion of such loans also may not be repaid due to the borrower's inability to satisfy the contractual obligations of the loan.\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>New England </td> <td> </td> <td>Northern California </td> <td> </td> <td>Southern California </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands, except percentages) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial and industrial </td> <td>$ </td> <td>437,235 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,650 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82,458 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>558,343 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Paycheck Protection Program </td> <td>162,373 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>101,149 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>48,834 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>312,356 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial tax-exempt </td> <td>286,549 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>145,014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10,596 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>442,159 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate </td> <td>1,124,232 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>904,174 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>728,969 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2,757,375 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction and land </td> <td>91,765 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>27,775 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>39,664 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>159,204 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential </td> <td>1,357,843 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>539,608 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>780,013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2,677,464 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home equity </td> <td>51,070 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>16,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10,002 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>77,364 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer and other </td> <td>82,858 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4,020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>33,166 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>120,044 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loans (1) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,593,925 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,776,682 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,733,702 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,104,309 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOccupancy and equipment expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $31.1 million, a decrease of $1.0 million, or 3%, from the same period in 2019, compared to a decrease of $0.1 million, or flat, from 2018 to 2019. The decrease in 2020 was primarily driven by decreases in amortization expense on Right-of use assets and depreciation expense on leasehold improvements due to lease expirations that were not renewed in 2020. The decrease in 2019 was due to fully depreciated leasehold improvements and a gain on lease modifications, partially offset by an increase in rent expense related to new office locations.\n\nTable

ended December 31, 2020 was $91.7 million, a decrease of $6.8 million, or 7%, from 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by decreases in Investment management fees and Wealth Management and trust fees. The decrease in Investment management fees was driven primarily by the impact of negative net flows and lower equity market values on AUM during 2020. The decrease in Wealth management and trust fees was driven primarily by a reduction in the average effective fee rate during 2020 due to competitive forces.\nOther assets, which consist primarily of Bank-owned life insurance ( BOLI\u201d), prepaid expenses, investment in partnerships, interest rate derivatives, cash collateral, and other receivables, increased $71.9 million, or 25%, to $359.2 million at December 31, 2020 from $287.3 million at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the market value adjustment to derivative assets, an increase in cash collateral, and an increase to the investment in partnerships.\nTotal interest and dividend income. Total interest and dividend income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $273.7 million, a decrease of $34.7 million, or 11%, compared to 2019, after an increase of $15.5 million, or 5%, in 2019 from 2018. The 2020 decrease was primarily driven by lower yields on loans and cash and investments, partially offset by the addition of PPP loans and higher volume of cash and investments. The 2019 increase was primarily driven by higher yields on investments and loans and higher volume of loans, partially offset by lower volume of investments.\nInterest paid on borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $8.3 million, a decrease of $13.0 million, or 61%, compared to 2019, after increasing $2.8 million, or 15%, in 2019 from 2018. The 2020 decrease was primarily the result of a 144 basis point decrease in average rate paid on Junior subordinated debentures, a 98 basis point decrease in average rate paid on FHLB borrowings, and a 43% decrease in the average balance of FHLB borrowings and other. The average rate paid on FHLB borrowings is affected by both the yield and the structure or term of the borrowing. The 2019 increase was primarily the result of a 45 basis point increase in average rate paid on FHLB borrowings and a 25 basis point increase in the average rate paid on Junior subordinated debentures, partially offset by a 6% decrease in average balance of FHLB borrowings and other. The 2020 decrease in the average rates paid was primarily driven by the decreases in benchmark interest rates to which the instruments are tied. The 2019 increase in average rates paid were the result of increases in market interest rates. The 2020 decrease in the average balance for FHLB borrowings and other was primarily driven by the repayment of FHLB borrowings in 2020, as the increase in deposits was used to pay down higher cost borrowings.\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

The increase was primarily driven by lower funding costs and the addition of PPP-related income, partially offset by lower interest rates on interest-earning assets. NIM decreased 11 basis points to 2.69% in 2020 from 2.80% in 2019. The decrease in NIM in 2020 was driven primarily by lower yields on interest-earning assets and higher volumes of interest-earning assets, primarily excess cash balances held at lower rates due to higher deposit levels, partially offset by lower funding costs.\n\u2022 Trends in volume and terms of loans\nInterest income on Home equity loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2.9 million, a decrease of $1.5 million, or 33%, compared to 2019, after remaining flat in 2019 from 2018. The 2020 decrease was driven by a 147 basis point decrease in average yield and a 5% decrease in the average balance. The 2020 decrease in the average yield was primarily the result of decreases to the interest rate benchmarks to which the variable rate loans are tied. The 2019 increase in the average yield was primarily driven by the impact of the timing of benchmark interest rate increases in 2018 compared to the timing of benchmark interest rate cuts in 2019. The 2020 decrease in the average balance was primarily driven by reduced demand as a result of economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2019 decrease in the average balance was primarily due to decreases in client demand given the increase in interest rates as the loans are lines of credit.\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>

The 2020 decrease was primarily driven by an 87 basis point decrease in average yield, partially offset by a 6% increase in average balance. The 2019 increase was primarily driven by a 6 basis point increase in average yield and a 2% increase in average balance. The 2020 decrease in the average yield was primarily the result of decreases to the interest rate benchmarks to which the variable rate loans are tied and lower yields on loan originations. The 2019 increase in the average yield was primarily driven by the impact of the timing of benchmark interest rate increases in 2018 compared to the timing of benchmark interest rate cuts in 2019. The 2020 increase in the average balance was related primarily to the addition of approximately $80.0 million of loans under the Commercial real estate second loan program in the second quarter of 2020 as part of the relief measures provided to clients as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2019 increase in the average balance was primarily driven by organic growth, primarily in the Southern California and Northern California regions.\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2: Restructuring\u201d for further detail.\n2016-13 as of January 1, 2020, the Allowance for loan losses was determined under the incurred loss model. Refer to Part II. Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" for a description of the methodology.\nResidential loans. While the Bank has no minimum size for mortgage loans, it concentrates its origination activities in the Jumbo\u201d segment of the market. This segment consists of loans secured by single-family and one- to four-unit properties in excess of the amount eligible for purchase by the Federal National Mortgage Association, which was $510 thousand at December 31, 2020 for the General\u201d limit and $766 thousand for single-family properties for the High-Cost\u201d limit, depending on from which specific geographic region of the Bank's primary market areas the loan originated. The majority of the Bank's Residential loan portfolio, including jumbo mortgage loans, is adjustable rate mortgages (\"ARMs\"). The ARM loans the Bank originates generally have a fixed interest rate for the first three to ten years and then adjust annually based on a market index such as U.S. Treasury or LIBOR yields. ARM loans may negatively impact the Bank's interest income when they reprice if yields on U.S. Treasuries or LIBOR are lower than the yields at the time of origination. If rates reset higher, the Bank could see increased delinquencies if clients' ability to make payments is impacted by the higher payments.\nNet Interest Income and Margin\nLease liabilities decreased $4.9 million, or 4%, to $112.3 million at December 31, 2020 from $117.2 million at December 31, 2019 due to lease payments, and lease modifications, partially offset by the addition of new or renewed real estate leases and new equipment leases during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Upon adoption of the lease accounting standard discussed above, the Company recognized $124.1 million of Lease liabilities on the face of the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 1, 2019. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7: Premises, Equipment, and Leases.\u201d\nNo impairment losses were recognized through earnings related to investment securities during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The amount of investment securities in an unrealized loss position greater than 12 months, as well as the total amount of unrealized losses, was primarily due to changes in interest rates since the securities were purchased and not due to credit quality or other risk factors.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\n(2) Average loans include loans held for sale and nonaccrual loans.\n________________________\nMarketing and business development expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $6.3 million, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 2%, from the same period in 2019, compared to a decrease of $1.2 million, or 16%, from 2018 to 2019. The 2020 decrease was primarily driven by lower travel and business development expenses, partially offset by higher marketing program expense. The 2019 decrease was primarily driven by lower travel and business development expenses.\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nNet interest income represents the difference between interest earned, primarily on loans and investments, and interest paid on funding sources, primarily deposits and borrowings. Interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield earned on total interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on total interest-bearing liabilities. NIM is the amount of Net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. The average yield earned on earning assets is the amount of annualized interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities is equal to annualized interest expense as a percentage of average interest-bearing liabilities. When credit quality declines and loans are placed on nonaccrual status, NIM can decrease because the same assets are earning less income. $106.9 million of loans that were graded substandard but were still accruing interest income at December 31, 2020 could be placed on nonaccrual status if their credit quality declines further.\nrate, or as a practical expedient, impairment may be determined based upon the observable market price of the loan, or the fair value of the collateral, less estimated costs to sell, if the loan is collateral dependent.\u201d A loan is collateral dependent if repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral or sale of the underlying collateral. For collateral dependent loans, appraisals are generally used to determine the fair value. When a collateral dependent loan becomes impaired, an updated appraisal of the collateral is obtained, if appropriate. Appraised values are generally discounted for factors such as the Bank's intention to liquidate the property quickly in a foreclosure sale or the date when the appraisal was performed if the Bank believes that collateral values have declined since the date the appraisal was done. The Bank may use a broker opinion of value in addition to an appraisal to validate the appraised value. In certain instances, the Bank may consider broker opinions of value as well as other qualitative factors while an appraisal is being prepared.\n\nOther expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $15.5 million, an increase of $1.6 million, or 11%, from the same period in 2019, compared to a decrease of $0.2 million, or 2%, from 2018 to 2019. The 2020 increase in Other expense was primarily driven by an increase to the reserve for unfunded loan commitments. The overall change in the reserve was driven by a change in Allowance for loan losses methodology, an increase in the reserve ratios as a result of the current reasonable and supportable economic forecasts due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and an increase in the balance of loan commitments. The 2019 decrease in Other expense was primarily driven by lower operational losses and other miscellaneous expense.\nGoodwill is subject to annual impairment testing, or more frequently, if there is indication of impairment, based on guidance in ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. Long-lived intangible assets such as advisory contracts are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment ( ASC 360\u201d).\nInterest income on PPP loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $7.8 million. The Company\nThe Company had no intent to sell any securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2020, and it was not more likely than not that the Company would be forced to sell any of these securities prior to the full recovery of all unrealized losses.\n\u2022 Volume and trend of past-due, non-accrual, and adversely-graded loans\nTotal assets. Total assets increased $1.2 billion, or 14%, to $10.0 billion at December 31, 2020 from $8.8 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in client deposits in 2020 which generated additional liquidity.\nnm - not meaningful\n\nLoans. Total portfolio loans increased $127.6 million, or 2%, to $7.1 billion, or 71% of total assets, at December 31, 2020, from $7.0 billion, or 79% of total assets, at December 31, 2019.

The decrease was primarily due to the current year tax effect of Other comprehensive income of $9.5 million and the tax effect of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 of $5.5 million, partially offset by the deferred tax benefit of $10.4 million which was primarily related to the additional Allowance for loan losses. At December 31, 2020, no valuation\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank initiated a Residential mortgage and Home equity line loan deferment program under which principal and interest payments on qualifying loans are generally deferred for initially three months and the loan term is extended three months; if requested, the loan may be deferred for a subsequent three months. Loans\nThe Company recognized Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $0.55 per share, compared to $0.97 per share and $0.90 per share in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Diluted earnings per share attributable to common shareholders, which includes both continuing and discontinued operations, if any, for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $0.55 per share, compared to earnings of $0.97 per share and $0.92 per share in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net income from continuing operations in 2020 and 2019 was positively impacted by decreases in the redemption value of certain redeemable noncontrolling interests, which increased income available to common shareholders. Net income from continuing operations in 2018 was partially offset by dividends paid on preferred stock, net of a decrease in the redemption value of certain redeemable noncontrolling interests. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16: Earnings Per Share\u201d for further detail on the charges made to arrive at income attributable to common shareholders.\n(1) Investments classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity are shown in the average balance sheet at amortized cost.\nThe increase in Net income attributable to the Company from 2018 to 2019 was primarily driven by a decrease in Total operating expense of $7.4 million, primarily due to a decrease in Restructuring expense, a decrease in Salaries and employee benefits expense, and a Provision credit for loan losses of $3.6 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in Income tax expense of $2.8 million and a decrease in Total revenue of $1.7 million, primarily due to lower Net interest income.\nExecutive Summary\nLoan portfolio composition. The following table presents the outstanding loan balances by class of receivable as of the dates indicated and the percent of each category to total loans.\nAccrued interest receivable amounts are excluded from balances of loans held at amortized cost and are included within Accrued interest receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management has elected not to measure an Allowance for loan losses on these amounts as the Company employs a timely write-off policy as generally any loan over 89 days past-due is put on non-accrual status and any associated accrued interest is reversed.\n\u2022 Concentration risk\nCommercial and Industrial Loan Deferment Program\nNet interest income. Net interest income increased 2% from 2019 to 2020, after decreasing 3% from 2018 to 2019. The increase in Net interest income in 2020 was primarily driven by lower funding costs and the addition of PPP-related income, partially offset by lower interest on interest-earning assets. The decrease in Net interest income in 2019 was primarily driven by an increase in the average rate paid on deposits, partially offset by higher yields and higher average balances of loans, and a decrease in the average balance of borrowings. These changes are discussed in more detail below.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2020, the Company made a change to the loan portfolio segmentation in which\nCommercial and industrial and Commercial tax-exempt loans were bifurcated given their different underlying risk\nnm - not meaningful\nBorrowings. Total borrowings, which consists of Securities sold under agreements to repurchase; Federal funds purchased, if any; FHLB borrowings; and Junior subordinated debentures, decreased $236.1 million, or 46%, to $274.5 million at December 31, 2020 from $510.6 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by the use of deposits to pay down higher cost borrowings.\nallowance on the net deferred tax asset was required primarily due to the ability to generate future taxable income. The Company does not have any capital losses in excess of capital gains as of December 31, 2020.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nUnder the Current Expected Credit Losses (\"CECL\") methodology, which the Company adopted on January 1, 2020, the Company estimates credit losses on a collective basis for loans sharing similar risk characteristics using a quantitative model combined with an assessment of certain qualitative factors designed to address risks not incorporated in the quantitative model output. The quantitative model utilizes economic factors and our selected peer groups' historical default and loss experience evaluated over the historical observation period to estimate expected credit losses. The expected credit losses are the product of multiplying the Company's estimates of probability of default, net loss given default, and individual loan level exposure at default on an undiscounted basis. The model estimates expected credit losses using loan level data over the contractual life of the exposure, considering the effect of estimated prepayment and curtailment rates, both of which are derived from the Company's recent historical experience on the remaining portfolio segment balance over the life of the portfolio. Reasonable and supportable economic forecasts are incorporated into the estimate over a reasonable and supportable forecast period, beyond which is a reversion to the Company's historical long-run average of the macroeconomic variables, such as Gross Domestic Product, Unemployment, Consumer Confidence Index etc. Management has determined a reasonable and supportable period of two years and a straight line reversion period of twelve months to be appropriate for purposes of estimating expected credit losses. Management also applies a weight to the various forecasts to determine the reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. A portion of the collective Allowance for loan losses is related to the qualitative factors used to adjust historical loss information for asset-specific characteristics and current conditions to the extent they are not captured sufficiently in the quantitative model. The qualitative factors are based on information not reflected in the quantitative models but are likely to impact the measurement of estimated credit losses. The Company's qualitative assessment includes the following factors:\n____________\nThe Bank specializes in lending to individuals, real estate investors, nonprofit organizations, and middle market businesses, including corporations, partnerships, and associations. Loans made by the Bank to individuals may include Residential mortgage loans and mortgage loans on investment or vacation properties, unsecured and secured personal lines of credit, home equity loans, and overdraft protection. Loans made by the Bank to businesses include commercial and mortgage loans, revolving lines of credit, working capital loans, equipment financing, community lending programs, and construction and land loans. The types and sizes of loans the Bank originates are limited by regulatory requirements.\nThe following table presents selected financial highlights:\nDeposits. Deposits increased $1.4 billion, or 19%, to $8.6 billion, at December 31, 2020 from $7.2 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase was driven by increased deposits from new and existing clients throughout the year. Deposits are the principal source of the Bank's funds for use in lending, investments, and liquidity. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10: Deposits\u201d for further information.\nInterest income on Residential mortgage loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $89.7 million, a decrease of $11.4 million, or 11%, compared to 2019, after increasing $8.2 million, or 9%, in 2019 from 2018. The 2020 decrease was primarily driven by a 20 basis point decrease in average yield and a 6% decrease in average balance. The 2019 increase was primarily driven by a 6% increase in average balance and an 8 basis point increase in average yield. The 2020 decrease in the average yield was primarily the result of decreases to the interest rate benchmarks to which the variable rate loans are tied and lower yields on loan originations. The 2019 increase in the average yield was primarily driven by new loans being originated at higher interest rates. The 2020 decrease in the average balance was primarily driven by the sale of approximately $72.0 million of Residential loans in the third quarter of 2020. The 2019 increase in the average balance was primarily driven by organic growth of the Residential loan portfolio, specifically in the New England and Southern California markets, partially offset by the sale of $190.7 million of Residential loans in 2019.\nROU assets at December 31, 2020 decreased $4.2 million, or 4%, to $97.9 million at December 31, 2020 from $102.1 million at December 31, 2019 due to amortization of ROU assets, lease expirations that were not renewed, and lease modifications, partially offset by the addition of real estate leases and equipment leases during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Upon adoption of the lease accounting standard, ASU 2016-02, the Company recognized $108.5 million of ROU assets on the face of the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 1, 2019. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7: Premises, Equipment, and Leases.\u201d\nRate-Volume Analysis\n\u2022Total operating expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $241.3 million, an increase of $11.1 million, or 5%, from 2019. The increase was primarily driven by increases in Information systems expense as a result of new information technology (\"IT\") initiatives placed into service, Salaries and employee benefits expense, and the reserve for unfunded loan commitments within Other expense, partially offset by decreases in Restructuring expense and Professional services expense.\nThe Bank's loans are affected by the economic and real estate markets in which they are located. Generally, Commercial real estate, and Construction and land loans are affected more than Residential mortgage loans in an economic downturn. The ability to grow the loan portfolio is partially related to the Bank's ability to increase deposit levels. If, as a result of general economic conditions, market interest rates, competitive pressures, or otherwise, the amount of deposits at the Bank decreases, the Bank may be limited in its ability to grow its loan portfolio or may have to rely more heavily on higher cost borrowings as a source of funds in the future. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Bank sold $72.0 million of Residential mortgage loans driven by Asset-Liability Management (\"ALM\") consideration and anticipated deposit levels.\nConstruction and land loans. Construction and land loans include loans for financing of new developments as well as financing for improvements to existing buildings. In addition, tax-exempt construction and land loans are provided for the construction phase of the Commercial tax-exempt and Commercial real estate tax-exempt loans described above.\nDiscussion of Noninterest Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\nFrom time to time, the Company purchases Federal funds from the FHLB and other banking institutions to supplement its liquidity position. The Company had no outstanding Federal funds purchased at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. FHLB borrowings decreased $236.2 million, or 67%, to $114.7 million at December 31, 2020 from $350.8 million at December 31, 2019. FHLB borrowings are generally used to provide additional funding for loan growth when the rate of loan growth exceeds deposit growth and to manage interest rate risk, but can also be used as an additional source of liquidity for the Bank. Given the higher deposits and cash balances at December 31, 2020, there was less need for additional liquidity from the purchase of Federal funds or FHLB borrowings. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company used additional liquidity to pay down $61.5 million of long-term FHLB borrowings, thereby incurring FHLB prepayment penalties of $0.4 million.\nThere have been no significant changes to judgments in determining the fair value of assets or liabilities, and there have been no material impairments of financial assets. The Company will continue to monitor the fair value of assets to determine if trigger events exist to warrant further impairment testing.\n_______________\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank also initiated a program to offer qualifying Commercial real estate borrowers a second mortgage to cover up to one year of principal and interest payments. In order to qualify for the loan, the total exposure after receiving the second mortgage for each borrower could not exceed a 75% loan-to-value ratio, and the loans were required to be current at the time of application, amongst other conditions. In total, borrowers with approximately 240 existing loans totaling $1.3 billion requested and were approved for these second mortgages, representing approximately 50% of the Commercial real estate loan balance. As of December 31, 2020, the borrowers associated with the $1.3 billion of existing loans had an outstanding balance of approximately $72.0 million. The Company does not anticipate a material increase in the program balance of new loans in the future, and the principal balance will amortize down over the life of the loan, generally five years. In addition to, and outside of the Commercial real estate second loan program, the Bank offered qualified Commercial real estate borrowers principal payment deferral for up to 12 months, with the deferred principal added to the balance due at maturity. In total, 13 Commercial real estate borrowers with loans totaling $49.0 million accepted this accommodation. As of December 31, 2020, deferrals for 10 borrowers with loans totaling $40.3 million have expired with the loans returning to payment, while 3 borrowers with loans totaling approximately $8.7 million remain in deferral. Of the loans that came off deferral, no loans are delinquent on payment terms as of December 31, 2020. The entire Commercial real estate portfolio will continue to be monitored for credit deterioration regardless of their participation in the plan.\n______________________\nGoodwill and intangible assets, net. Goodwill and intangible assets, net decreased $1.3 million, or 2%, to $66.7 million at December 31, 2020 from $68.0 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by the Amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by an increase in the addition of servicing rights of $1.4 million. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 8: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d for a discussion of the annual goodwill impairment testing.\nThe interest rates charged on loans vary with the degree of risk, maturity, and amount of the loan and are further subject to competitive pressures, market rates, the availability of funds, and legal and regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2020, approximately 60% of the Bank's outstanding loans due after one year had interest rates that were either floating or adjustable in nature. See Part II.\n\nnm - not meaningful\n\u2022 Banking industry conditions, other external factors, and inherent model risk\nThe Bank makes a determination of the applicable loss rate for these factors based on relevant local market conditions, credit quality, and portfolio mix. Each quarter, management reviews the loss factors to determine if there have been any changes in its loan portfolio, market conditions, or other risk indicators which would result in a change to the current loss factor.\n\n\u2022Average total loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $7.2 billion, an increase of 3% from 2019, driven primarily by the addition of PPP loans and an increase in Commercial real estate loans, partially offset by a decrease in Residential loans due to the $72.0 million of Residential loan sales in the third quarter of 2020.\n(1)With the integration of KLS into Boston Private Wealth in the third quarter of 2019, the results of KLS are included in the Wealth Management and Trust segment for all periods. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 3: Divestitures\u201d for additional information.\nOther income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2.2 million, a decrease of $0.8 million, or 26%, from the same period in 2019, compared to an increase of $2.1 million, from 2018 to 2019. The decrease in 2020 was primarily driven by the impact of the market value adjustment on derivatives and the value of the rabbi trust securities related to the Company's deferred compensation plan, partially offset by an increase in miscellaneous income primarily due to the addition of servicing rights related to the Residential loan sales in the third quarter of 2020 and the Federal Reserve's Main Street Lending Program. The increase in 2019 was primarily driven by an increase in the value of the rabbi trust securities related to the Company's deferred compensation plan and an increase in miscellaneous income.\n____________\n\nThe following discussions are based on the Company's continuing operations, unless otherwise stated.\nWhile this evaluation process utilizes historical and other objective information, the classification of loans and the establishment of the Allowance for loan losses rely to a great extent on the judgment and experience of management. While management evaluates currently available information in establishing the Allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the Allowance for loan losses may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluations. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review a financial institution's Allowance for loan losses as well as loan grades/classifications.\nInvestment income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $24.7 million, a decrease of $2.2 million, or 8%, compared to 2019, after also decreasing $3.5 million, or 12%, in 2019 from 2018. The 2020 decrease was the result of a 71 basis point decrease in the average yield, partially offset by a 31% increase in the average balance. The 2019 decrease was the result of a 16% decrease in the average balance, partially offset by an 11 basis point increase in the average yield. The decrease in the average yield in 2020 was primarily due to the lower interest rate environment. The increase in the average yield in 2019 was primarily driven by increases in the federal discount rate and higher dividends paid on FHLB stock. The increase in Total cash and investments average balance in 2020 was primarily due to additional cash from higher client deposit balances. The decrease in Total cash and investments average balance in 2019 was primarily driven by the use of investment and other cash flows to fund loan growth instead of reinvesting in additional investment securities in response to a flattening yield curve.\nFor periods disclosed prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13 as of January 1, 2020, the Allowance for loan losses was determined under the incurred loss model. Upon the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, management's processes for the Allowance for loan losses has changed. The updates in this standard replace the incurred loss impairment methodology, previously accounted for in accordance with Receivables ( ASC 310\u201d) and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 102 (July 2001), with the updated methodology described below that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for further details.\nAnnounced Acquisition\nInformation systems expense consists of contract servicing, computer hardware and software charges, and technology service agreements. Information systems expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $29.6 million, an increase of $6.9 million, or 31%, from the same period in 2019, compared to a decrease of $2.5 million, or 10%, from 2018 to 2019. The increase in 2020 was primarily driven by information technology initiatives placed into service and an increase in costs related to building out remote working capabilities in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in 2019 was primarily due to lower telecommunications expense as a result of previously-enacted efficiency initiatives and the impact of the sales of Anchor and BOS, partially offset by an increase in technology service agreements related to new technology initiatives.\nDeposits at the Bank increased $1.4 billion, or 19%, to $8.7 billion at December 31, 2020 from $7.3 billion at December 31, 2019. A discussion of the Company's deposits can be found below in Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Condition.\u201d\nIf the loan is deemed to be collateral dependent, generally the difference between the book balance (client balance less any prior charge-offs or client interest payments applied to principal) and the fair value of the collateral is taken as a partial charge-off through the Allowance for loan losses in the current period. If the loan is not determined to be collateral dependent, then a specific allocation to the general reserve is established for the difference between the book balance of the loan and the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate. Charge-offs for loans not considered to be collateral dependent are made when it is determined a loss has been incurred. Impaired loans are removed from the general loan pools. There may be instances where the loan is considered impaired although based on the fair value of underlying collateral or the discounted expected future cash flows there is no impairment to be recognized. In addition, all loans which are classified as TDRs are considered impaired.\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $233.4 million, an increase of $5.4 million, or 2%, compared to 2019, after a decrease of $6.5 million, or 3%, from 2018 to 2019. The increase in Net interest income in 2020 was primarily driven by lower funding costs and the addition of PPP-related income, partially offset by lower interest rates on interest-earning assets. The decrease in Net interest income in 2019 was primarily driven by an increase in rates paid on deposits and borrowings, partially offset by increased yields and volumes on loans. NIM was 2.69%, 2.80%, and 2.92% for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\n\u2022 Experience and depth of management\nTotal operating expense. Total operating expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $241.3 million, an increase of $11.1 million, or 5%, from the same period in 2019, compared to a decrease of $37.1 million, or 14%, from 2018 to 2019. The increase in 2020 was primarily driven by increases in Information systems expense, Salaries and employee benefits expense, and the reserve for unfunded loan commitments within Other expense, partially offset by decreases in Restructuring expense, Professional services expense, and Occupancy and equipment expense. The decrease in 2019 was primarily driven by the impact of the sales of Anchor and BOS, lower Salaries and employee benefits expense, and lower Information systems expense. See below for additional information on expense drivers.\nCash and investments. Total cash and investments (consisting of Cash and cash equivalents, Investment securities available-for-sale, Investment securities held-to-maturity, Equity securities at fair value, and Stock in the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank) increased $1.0 billion, or 75%, to $2.4 billion, or 24% of Total assets at December 31, 2020 from $1.4 billion, or 16% of Total assets at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in Cash and cash equivalents of $0.8 billion, an increase in Investment securities available-for-sale of $265.4 million, or 27%, and an increase in Equity securities of $22.6 million, partially offset by a decrease in Investment securities held-to-maturity securities of $13.0 million, or 27%, and a decrease in FHLB stock of $10.4 million, or 27%. The increase in Cash and investments was driven by an increase in client deposits throughout the year which were primarily invested in cash and investment securities.\nCommercial tax-exempt loans. Commercial tax-exempt loans include loans to not-for-profit private schools, colleges, and public charter schools.\nOther Accounting Matters\nThe following table describes the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities have affected the Company's interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. Information is provided in each category with respect to: (i) changes attributable to changes in volumes (changes in average balance multiplied by prior year average yield/rate) and (ii) changes attributable to changes in yield/rate\nThe following table presents a summary of selected financial data for the Wealth Management and Trust segment for 2020, 2019, and 2018.\nConsumer and other loans. Consumer and other loans consist of balances outstanding on consumer loans including personal lines of credit, and loans arising from overdraft protection extended to individual and business clients. Personal lines of credit are typically for high net worth clients whose assets may not be liquid due to investments, closely held stock or restricted stock. The amount of Consumer and other loans typically depends on client demand.\nThe Provision/(credit) for loan losses is determined as a result of the required level of the Allowance for loan losses, estimated by management, which reflects the inherent risk of loss in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet dates. The Company estimates credit losses on a collective basis for loans sharing similar risk characteristics using a quantitative model combined with an assessment of certain qualitative factors designed to address forecast risk and model risk inherent in the quantitative model output. The quantitative model utilizes a factor-based approach to estimate expected credit losses using probability of default and loss given default, which are derived from a selected peer group's historical default and loss experience. The model estimates expected credit losses using loan level data over the contractual life of the exposure, considering the effect of prepayments and curtailments. Economic forecasts are incorporated into the estimate over a reasonable and supportable forecast period, beyond which is a reversion to the Company's historical long-run average. Qualitative factors are estimated by management and include trends in problem loans, strength of management, concentration risk and underwriting standards. For further details, see Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Loan Portfolio and Credit Quality\u201d below. For periods disclosed prior to the adoption of ASU\n\nto lower revolving line of credit usage. The 2019 increase in the average balance was primarily driven by organic growth, primarily in the New England region.\n(change in average interest rate multiplied by prior year average balance), while (iii) changes attributable to the combined impact of volumes and rates have been allocated proportionately to separate volume and rate categories.\nTotal loans at the Bank increased $0.1 billion, or 2%, to $7.1 billion at December 31, 2020 from $7.0 billion at December 31, 2019. Total loans were 71% of Total assets at the Bank as of December 31, 2020, compared to 80% of Total assets at December 31, 2019. A discussion of the Company's loan portfolio can be found below in Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Loan Portfolio and Credit Quality.\u201d\nAUM increased $1.4 billion, or 9%, to $16.6 billion at December 31, 2020 from $15.2 billion at December 31, 2019. In 2020, the increase in AUM was driven by favorable market returns of $1.3 billion and positive net flows of $0.1 billion. In 2019, the $1.0 billion increase in AUM from 2018 was primarily driven by favorable market returns of $2.0 billion, partially offset by net outflows of $1.0 billion. The decrease in Total revenue of 4% from the prior year is driven primarily by a reduction in the average effective fee rate.\nA loan is considered impaired in accordance with ASC 326 when, based upon current information and events, it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impairment is measured based on the fair value of the loan, expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest\nThe following table presents a summary of selected financial data for the Private Banking segment for 2020, 2019, and 2018.\nIncome tax expense. Income tax expense for continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $8.9 million, a decrease of $13.7 million, or 61%, from the same period in 2019, compared to a decrease of $14.9 million, or 40%, from 2018 to 2019. The effective tax rate for continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 16.4%, compared to effective tax rates of 21.9% and 31.4% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2020 was lower than 2019 primarily due to the lower level of income in 2020 as compared to 2019. The effective tax rate for 2019 was lower than 2018 primarily due to the Income tax expense related to the Anchor transaction closing in 2018. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 17: Income Taxes\u201d for further detail.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and continues to cause, substantial disruptions to the global economy and to the customers and communities that we serve. In response to the pandemic, the Company implemented business continuity contingency plans, including company-wide remote working arrangements. We are also focused on supporting our clients who may be experiencing a financial hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including by participating in the SBA's PPP and offering loan deferrals and forbearance as needed, including our Residential mortgage and Home equity line loan deferment program and Commercial and industrial loan deferment program, and creating the Commercial real estate second loan program. We will continue to evaluate this fluid situation and take additional actions as necessary.\nInvestment securities available-for-sale and Investment securities held-to-maturity maturities, calls, principal payments, and sales, if any, net of purchases of investment securities used $227.8 million of cash during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $66.1 million of cash generated for the year ended December 31, 2019. Equity securities investment sales, net of investment purchases decreased cash by $22.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a decrease in cash of $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Proceeds from investment securities are generally used to fund a portion of loan growth, pay down borrowings or purchase new investments. The timing of sales and reinvestments is based on various factors, including management's evaluation of interest rate trends, credit risk, and the Company's liquidity. The Company's portfolio of Investment securities available-for-sale carried a total of $45.8 million of unrealized gains and $0.6 million of unrealized losses at December 31, 2020, compared to $15.0 million of unrealized gains and $3.6 million of unrealized losses at December 31, 2019. For information regarding the weighted average yield and maturity of investments, see Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4: Investment Securities.\u201d\nThe following table summarizes the Company's carrying value of Investment securities available-for-sale, Investment securities held-to-maturity, and Equity securities at fair value as of the dates indicated:\n________________\n(1)Regional percentage totals may not reconcile due to rounding.\n\nThe Company's Private Banking segment reported Net income attributable to the Company of $43.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $72.2 million in 2019 and $68.0 million in 2018. The decrease from 2019 to 2020 was primarily driven by a change in Provision/(credit) for loan losses of $35.6 million and an increase in Total operating expense of $10.1 million, primarily due to increases in Information systems expense, the reserve for unfunded loan commitments within Other expense, and Salaries and employee benefits expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in Income tax expense of $12.5 million and an increase in Total revenue of $3.9 million, primarily due to higher Net interest income.\nAdditionally, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank initiated a program offering qualified Commercial and industrial borrowers principal payment deferral for six months, with the deferred principal added to the last payment. In total, approximately 85 Commercial and industrial loans totaling approximately $125.0 million have been processed under the program. As of December 31, 2020, deferrals for approximately 80 loans totaling approximately $115.0 million have expired with the loans returning to payment, while approximately five loans totaling approximately $10.0 million remain in deferral under the program. Of the loans that came off deferral, no loans are delinquent on payment terms as of December 31, 2020.\nThe Allowance for loan losses consists of two primary components: general reserves on pass, non-impaired special mention, and substandard loans as well as specific reserves on impaired loans. The calculation of the Allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of management judgment and estimates designed to reflect the inherent risk of loss in the loan portfolio at the measurement date The Allowance for loan losses is established based upon the Company's current estimate of expected lifetime credit losses on loans measured at amortized cost.\nCommercial and industrial loans. Commercial and industrial loans include working capital and revolving lines of credit, term loans for equipment and fixed assets, and SBA loans.\n\u2022 Risk surrounding loan review\nFinancial Condition\nResults of Operations\nThe Bank generally has interest income that is either recovered or reversed related to nonaccruing loans each quarter. Based on the net amount recovered or reversed, the impact on interest income and related yields can be either positive or negative. In addition, the Bank collects prepayment penalties on certain Commercial loans that pay off prior to maturity which could also impact interest income and related yields positively. The amount and timing of prepayment penalties varies.\nGain on sale of affiliate for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was zero, compared to a gain of $18.1 million in 2018. As discussed above, the gain of $18.1 million in 2018 relates to the sale of BOS. There were no sales of affiliates in 2020 or 2019.\nthat are deferred under the program are not considered TDRs or past due based on current regulatory guidance. In total, approximately 365 Residential mortgages and Home equity loans totaling approximately $220.0 million have been processed under the program. As of December 31, 2020, deferrals for approximately 300 loans totaling approximately $200.0 million have expired with the loans returning to payment, while approximately 40 loans totaling approximately $15.0 million remain in deferral under the program. Approximately 25 loans totaling approximately $5.0 million are delinquent on payment terms as of December 31, 2020 after the deferral expired, primarily First Time Home Buyer loans.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests. Redeemable noncontrolling interests decreased $1.4 million, or 100%, at December 31, 2020 from the balance at December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to fair value adjustments made throughout 2020 to the estimated maximum redemption value of the Company's sole majority-owned affiliate, DGHM.\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and Discussion\nThe majority of the investments held by the Company are held by the Bank. The Bank's investment policy requires management to maintain a portfolio of securities which will provide liquidity necessary to facilitate funding of loans, to cover deposit fluctuations, and to mitigate the Bank's overall balance sheet exposure to interest rate risk, while at the same time earning a satisfactory return on the funds invested. The securities in which the Bank may invest are subject to regulation and are generally limited to securities that are considered investment grade.\u201d\nPrivate Banking\nThe Company continues to monitor and evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the credit quality of our assets. Total criticized and classified loans as of December 31, 2020 was $318.0 million, a decrease of $4.6 million, or 1%, linked quarter, primarily driven by $39.0 million of loan payoffs, paydowns and upgrades, partially offset by $35.0 million of loan downgrades. Of the $35.0 million of downgrades in the fourth quarter of 2020, $31.0 million were Commercial real estate loans across eight relationships, primarily with retail, office, and hospitality collateral. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company recognized a total net provision credit of $5.4 million primarily driven by an improved economic forecast related to the current expected credit losses methodology, partially offset by increased qualitative reserves for Commercial real estate.\n\n(1)Deposits presented in this table do not include intercompany eliminations related to deposits in the Bank from the Holding Company.\n(1)All Mortgage-backed securities are guaranteed by the U.S. government, U.S. government agencies, or government-sponsored entities.\nSalaries and employee benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $139.7 million, an increase of $5.4 million, or 4%, from the same period in 2019, compared to a decrease of $27.2 million, or 17%, from 2018 to 2019. The increase in 2020 was driven primarily by an increase in salaries due to new hires in line with our strategic objectives. The decrease in 2019 was driven primarily by the impact of the sales of Anchor and BOS as well as realized savings from previously-enacted efficiency initiatives.\nThe Company's Wealth Management and Trust segment reported Net income attributable to the Company of $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $12.2 million in 2019 and $8.9 million in 2018. The decrease in Net income attributable to the Company from 2019 to 2020 was primarily driven by an increase in Total operating expense of $3.6 million primarily due to an increase in Salaries and employee benefits expense and a decrease in Total revenue of $3.2 million from lower fee income. The increase in Net income attributable to the Company from 2018 to 2019 was primarily driven by a decrease in Total operating expense of $8.1 million primarily due to decreases in Salaries and employee benefits expense, Information systems expense, and Restructuring expense, partially offset by a decrease in Total revenue of $3.2 million from lower fees.\nMortgage Deferment Program\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nNet income attributable to the Company was $45.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $80.0 million in 2019 and $80.4 million in 2018. The Company recognized Diluted earnings per share of $0.55 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $0.97 in 2019 and $0.92 in 2018. Key items that affected the Company's 2020 results include:\nThe Company offers a wide range of private banking, wealth management, and trust services to high net worth individuals, families, businesses and select institutions through its two reportable segments: (i) Private Banking and (ii) Wealth Management and Trust. This Executive Summary provides an overview of the most significant aspects of the Company's operating segments and operations. Details of the matters addressed in this summary are provided elsewhere in this document and, in particular, in the sections immediately following.\nThe Company's Allowance for loan losses is accounted for in accordance with guidance issued by various regulatory agencies, including: the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Policy Statement on the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (October 2019); SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 119 (November 2019); ASC 326, Financial Instruments \u2500 Credit Losses (\"ASC 326\"); and ASC 450, Contingencies.\nThe following table presents the composition of the Company's NIM for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.\nTotal interest expense. Total interest expense on deposits and borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $40.3 million, a decrease of $40.1 million, or 50%, compared to 2019, after increasing $22.0 million, or 38%, in 2019 from 2018.\nCommercial real estate loans. Commercial real estate loans are generally acquisition financing for commercial properties such as office buildings, retail properties, apartment buildings, and industrial/warehouse space. In addition, tax-exempt Commercial real estate loans are provided for affordable housing development and rehabilitation. These loans are often supplemented with federal, state, and/or local subsidies.\n\nWealth Management and Trust\nOther liabilities. Other liabilities, which consist primarily of accrued interest, accrued compensation, interest rate derivatives, other accrued expenses, and Lease liabilities, increased $52.8 million, or 20%, to $310.9 million at December 31, 2020 from $258.0 million at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the market value adjustment to derivative liabilities.\n\u2022 Risk surrounding lending policy and underwriting standards\nAs previously announced on January 4, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with SVB pursuant to which SVB will acquire the Company. The transaction has been unanimously approved by both companies' Boards of Directors and is expected to close in mid-2021, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the receipt of customary regulatory approvals and approval by the shareholders of the Company.\n\n\u2022AUM increased $0.3 billion, or 2%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $17.1 billion, primarily driven by favorable market returns of $1.0 billion, partially offset by $0.7 billion of negative net flows.\nThe following tables disclose the scheduled contractual maturities of portfolio loans by class of receivable at December 31, 2020. Loans having no stated maturity are reported as due in one year or less. The following tables also set forth the dollar amounts of loans that are scheduled to mature after one year segregated between fixed and adjustable interest rate loans.\nWealth management and trust fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $72.9 million, a decrease of $2.9 million, or 4%, from the same period in 2019, compared to a decrease of $24.1 million, or 24%, from 2018 to 2019. AUM in the Wealth Management and Trust segment increased $1.4 billion, or 9%, to $16.6 billion at December 31, 2020 from $15.2 billion at December 31, 2019. The AUM increase in 2020 was the result of favorable market returns of $1.3 billion and net inflows of $0.1 billion. The decrease in Wealth management and trust fees in 2020 was driven primarily by a reduction in the average effective fee rate. Fee income from BOS is included within Wealth management and trust fees for the period BOS was owned. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for additional information on the reporting of historical results for Anchor and BOS.\nInterest income on Construction and land loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $8.6 million, a decrease of $1.6 million, or 16%, compared to 2019, after increasing $1.5 million, or 18%, in 2019 from 2018. The 2020 decrease was primarily driven by a 94 basis point decrease in average yield, partially offset by a 4% increase in average balance. The 2019 increase was primarily driven by a 14% increase in average balance and a 12 basis point increase in average yield. The 2020 decrease in the average yield was primarily the result of decreases to the interest rate benchmarks to which the variable rate loans are tied. The 2019 increase in the average yield were primarily driven by the impact of the timing of benchmark interest rate increases in 2018 compared to the timing of benchmark interest rate cuts in 2019. The 2020 increase in the average balance was related primarily to line drawdowns, primarily in Southern California. The 2019 increase in average balance was primarily driven by organic fluctuations in a small number of large balance loans which show as large percentage changes given the relative size of the total loan balance.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\nInterest income on Commercial and industrial loans (including Commercial loans and Commercial tax-exempt loans), for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $37.3 million, a decrease of $7.7 million, or 17%, compared to 2019, after an increase of $7.0 million, or 18%, in 2019 from 2018. The 2020 decrease was primarily driven by a 58 basis point decrease in average yield and a 3% decrease in the average balance. The 2019 increase was primarily driven by a 12% increase in the average balance and a 22 basis point increase in average yield. The 2020 decrease in the average yield was primarily the result of decreases to the interest rate benchmarks to which the variable rate loans are tied and lower yields on loan originations. The 2019 change in the average yield was primarily driven by the impact of the timing of benchmark interest rate increases in 2018 compared to the timing of benchmark interest rate cuts in 2019. The 2020 decrease in the average balance was related primarily\nHome equity loans. Home equity loans consist of balances outstanding on second mortgages and home equity lines of credit extended to individual clients. The amount of Home equity loans typically depends on client demand.\ncharacteristics. Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, the Company also added a segment for PPP loans originated. For the\nProvision/(credit) for loan losses. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Provision/(credit) for loan losses was an expense of $32.0 million, compared to credits of $3.6 million and $2.2 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The 2020 Provision for loan losses was primarily driven by the change in Allowance for loan losses methodology from the incurred loss model to the current expected credit loss model, the current reasonable and supportable economic forecast deterioration as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the net change in qualitative factors to account for risks and assumptions related to our loan portfolio not incorporated in the forecasts. The 2019 credit to the Provision for loan losses was primarily driven by a net decrease in criticized and classified loans and an improvement in loss factors, partially offset by loan growth and a change in loan mix and loan volume. The 2018 credit to the provision for loan losses was primarily driven by net recoveries, an improvement in loss factors, and a decrease in criticized loans, partially offset by loan growth and the composition of the loan portfolio.\nCertificates of deposit in denominations of $100,000 or greater had the following schedule of maturities:\n\nThe Company's NIM decreased 11 basis points to 2.69% in 2020 from 2.80% in 2019, after decreasing 12 basis points in 2019 from 2.92% in 2018. Although Net interest income increased, the decrease in the Company's Net interest margin in 2020 was driven primarily by lower yields on interest-earning assets and higher volumes of interest-earning assets, primarily excess cash balances held at lower rates, partially offset by lower funding costs. The decrease in the Company's NIM in 2019 was primarily driven by the increased cost of deposits and borrowings, partially offset by higher yields on the loan portfolio and interest recoveries on previously nonaccrual loans as loan yields increased at a slower rate than deposits and borrowings.\nbegan earning interest income on PPP loans in the second quarter of 2020. Interest income on PPP loans includes interest earned on the loans and the accretion of origination fees over the life of the loans. If a loan is forgiven or otherwise paid off, the remainder of the processing fee will be accreted through Net interest income. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $62.2 million of loans were forgiven by the SBA, and a total of $5.1 million was accreted through Net interest income.\nInterest expense on deposits for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $32.0 million, a decrease of $27.1 million, or 46%, compared to 2019, after increasing $19.2 million, or 48%, in 2019 from 2018. The 2020 decrease was primarily driven by a 64 basis point decrease in average rate paid on deposits, partially offset by a 12% increase in the average balance of total deposits. The 2019 increase was primarily driven by a 38 basis point increase in average rate paid on deposits and a 4% increase in the average balance of total deposits. The decrease in the average yield in 2020 was primarily driven by wholesale reductions in rates paid for deposit accounts given decreases in interest rates as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in the average yield in 2019 was primarily driven by the increase in rates in 2018, which carry forward for much of 2019, impacting all deposit types, specifically Money market deposits and Certificates of deposits, and was primarily driven by increases to market interest rates. The 2020 increase in the average balance was driven by an increase in new and existing client deposits primarily in Money market and NOW accounts, partially offset by a decrease in Certificates of deposits. The 2019 increase in the average balance was driven by increases to Money market deposits and Certificates of deposit accounts.\nLoans held for sale. Loans held for sale increased $10.0 million to $17.4 million at December 31, 2020 from $7.4 million at December 31, 2019. The balance of Loans held for sale relates to the timing and volume of Residential loans originated for sale and the ultimate sale transaction, which is typically executed within a short period of time following the loan origination.\nLoans that no longer share similar risk characteristics with any pools of assets are subject to individual assessment and are removed from the collectively assessed pools to avoid double counting. For the loans that will be individually assessed, the Company will use either a discounted cash flow (\"DCF\") approach or a fair value of collateral approach. The latter approach will be used for loans deemed to be collateral dependent or when foreclosure is probable.\nUpon the adoption of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) (\"ASU 2016-13\") on January 1, 2020, management's processes for the Allowance for loan losses has changed. The updates in this standard replace the incurred loss impairment methodology, previously accounted for in accordance with Receivables ( ASC 310\u201d) while maintaining SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 102 (July 2001), with the Current Expected Credit Losses model methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates.\nNet income. The Company recorded Net income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $45.2 million, compared to Net income from continuing operations of $80.4 million and $81.9 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net income attributable to the Company, which includes income from both continuing and discontinued operations, if any, less Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $45.2 million, compared to income of $80.0 million and $80.4 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nChanges to the required level in the Allowance for loan losses result in either a Provision for loan losses, if an increase is required, or a Provision credit for loan losses, if a decrease is required. Loan losses are charged to the Allowance for loan losses when available information confirms that specific loans, or portions thereof, are uncollectible. Recoveries on loans previously charged-off are credited to the Allowance for loan losses when received in cash or when the Bank takes possession of other assets.\nInterest income on Other consumer loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $3.2 million, a decrease of $2.3 million, or 42%, compared to 2019, after also decreasing $1.1 million, or 17%, in 2019 from 2018. The 2020 decrease was primarily the result of a 162 basis point decrease in the average yield and a 6% decrease in the average balance. The 2019 decrease was primarily the result of a 22% decrease in the average balance, partially offset by a 28 basis point increase in the average yield. The 2020 decrease in the average yield was primarily the result of decreases to the interest rate benchmarks to which the variable rate loans are tied. The 2019 increase in the average yield was primarily driven by the impact of the timing of benchmark interest rate increases in 2018 compared to the timing of benchmark interest rate cuts in 2019. The 2020 decrease in the average balance was primarily driven by a strategic decision to slow new consumer loan growth. The 2019 decrease in average balance was primarily due to changes in client demand.\nPaycheck Protection Program. PPP loans are loans made under the PPP as stipulated through the CARES Act.\nLoan Portfolio and Credit Quality\nAdditional information regarding the effects and potential effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's business, operating results and financial condition is described in this Management Discussion and Analysis. See also Part I. Item 1. \"Business - Supervision and Regulation\" and Part I. Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" for further details.\nThe following table summarizes the average balances and interest rates paid on the Bank's deposits:\n\n\u2022The Company recorded a Provision for loan losses of $32.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a credit of $3.6 million in 2019. The 2020 Provision for loan losses was primarily driven by the change in Allowance for loan losses methodology from the incurred loss model to the current expected credit loss model, the current reasonable and supportable economic forecast deterioration as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the net change in qualitative factors to account for risks and assumptions related to our loan portfolio not incorporated in the forecasts.\nOther assets. Other assets consisting of Premises and equipment, net; Fees receivable; Accrued interest receivable; Deferred income taxes, net; Right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets; and Other assets, increased $63.4 million, or 13%, to $537.0 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $473.6 million at December 31, 2019.\nperiod ended December 31, 2019 there were no such loans as the SBA initiated the program in the first quarter of 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.", "item_7_text": "FDIC insurance expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2.6 million, an increase of $1.3 million, from the same period in 2019, compared to a decrease of $1.6 million, or 55%, from 2018 to 2019. The 2020 increase was driven by the expiration of an FDIC insurance assessment credit received in the third quarter of 2019. The credit was utilized in full by the first quarter of 2020 and the Bank had resumed paying FDIC insurance for the remainder of 2020. The 2019 decrease was driven by $1.4 million of credits received by the Bank for its FDIC insurance premiums. In January 2019, the Bank received notification from the FDIC that it was eligible for small bank assessment credits of $2.0 million because the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio reserve ratio exceeded the target level.\nProfessional services expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $13.8 million, a decrease of $1.4 million, or 9%, from the same period in 2019, compared to an increase of $2.1 million, or 16%, from 2018 to 2019. The 2020 decrease was primarily driven by lower consulting fees. The 2019 increase was primarily driven by higher information technology consulting fees related to the implementation of technology initiatives, partially offset by lower recruitment expense.\n\n\u2022Average total deposits for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $7.6 billion, an increase of 13% from 2019, driven by an increase in new and existing client deposits, primarily in Money market accounts and Demand deposits, partially offset by a decrease in Certificates of deposits.\nThe Bank's Commercial real estate loan portfolio, the largest portfolio segment after Residential mortgage loans, includes loans secured by the following types of collateral as of the dates indicated:\nTotal fees and other income. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Total fees and other income was $93.9 million, a decrease of $7.7 million, or 8%, from the same period in 2019, compared to a decrease of $48.5 million, or 32%, from 2018 to 2019. The 2020 decrease was primarily driven by decreases in Investment management fees and Wealth management and trust fees. The 2019 decrease was primarily driven by the sales of Anchor and BOS in 2018 decreasing Investment management fees and Wealth management and trust fees, and the $18.1 million gain on the sale of BOS in 2018.\n\nnm - not meaningful\n________________________\n\nNet income from discontinued operations. Net income from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was zero. The Company received its final quarterly payment from a revenue sharing agreement from Westfield in the first quarter of 2018. When the Company filed its 2017 federal tax return in the fourth quarter of 2018, there was also an adjustment to deferred taxes related to the Westfield revenue share, which resulted in an additional tax credit recorded to Net income from discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nScheduled contractual maturities typically do not reflect the actual maturities of loans. The average maturity of loans is substantially less than their average contractual terms because of prepayments, curtailments and, in the case of conventional mortgage loans, due on sale clauses, which generally give the Bank the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event, among other things, that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage. The average life of mortgage loans tends to increase when current market rates are substantially higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and decrease when current market rates are substantially lower than rates on existing mortgages (due to refinancing of adjustable-rate and fixed-rate loans at lower rates). Under the latter circumstances, the weighted average yield on loans decreases as higher yielding loans are repaid or refinanced at lower rates. In addition, due to the likelihood that the Bank will, consistent with industry practice, rollover\u201d a significant portion of Commercial real estate and Commercial loans at or immediately prior to their maturity by renewing credit on substantially similar or revised terms, the principal repayments actually received by the Bank are anticipated to be significantly less than the amounts contractually due in any particular period. A portion of such loans also may not be repaid due to the borrower's inability to satisfy the contractual obligations of the loan.\nOccupancy and equipment expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $31.1 million, a decrease of $1.0 million, or 3%, from the same period in 2019, compared to a decrease of $0.1 million, or flat, from 2018 to 2019. The decrease in 2020 was primarily driven by decreases in amortization expense on Right-of use assets and depreciation expense on leasehold improvements due to lease expirations that were not renewed in 2020. The decrease in 2019 was due to fully depreciated leasehold improvements and a gain on lease modifications, partially offset by an increase in rent expense related to new office locations.\n\nCritical accounting policies reflect significant judgments and uncertainties, which could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The Company considers the accounting policies below to be its most critical accounting policies, upon which its financial condition depends and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments.\nCredit Quality and Provision for Loan Losses\n\u2022Total core fees and income, which includes Wealth management and trust fees, Investment management fees, Other banking fee income, and Gain on sale of loans, net for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $91.7 million, a decrease of $6.8 million, or 7%, from 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by decreases in Investment management fees and Wealth Management and trust fees. The decrease in Investment management fees was driven primarily by the impact of negative net flows and lower equity market values on AUM during 2020. The decrease in Wealth management and trust fees was driven primarily by a reduction in the average effective fee rate during 2020 due to competitive forces.\nOther assets, which consist primarily of Bank-owned life insurance ( BOLI\u201d), prepaid expenses, investment in partnerships, interest rate derivatives, cash collateral, and other receivables, increased $71.9 million, or 25%, to $359.2 million at December 31, 2020 from $287.3 million at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the market value adjustment to derivative assets, an increase in cash collateral, and an increase to the investment in partnerships.\nTotal interest and dividend income. Total interest and dividend income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $273.7 million, a decrease of $34.7 million, or 11%, compared to 2019, after an increase of $15.5 million, or 5%, in 2019 from 2018. The 2020 decrease was primarily driven by lower yields on loans and cash and investments, partially offset by the addition of PPP loans and higher volume of cash and investments. The 2019 increase was primarily driven by higher yields on investments and loans and higher volume of loans, partially offset by lower volume of investments.\nInterest paid on borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $8.3 million, a decrease of $13.0 million, or 61%, compared to 2019, after increasing $2.8 million, or 15%, in 2019 from 2018. The 2020 decrease was primarily the result of a 144 basis point decrease in average rate paid on Junior subordinated debentures, a 98 basis point decrease in average rate paid on FHLB borrowings, and a 43% decrease in the average balance of FHLB borrowings and other. The average rate paid on FHLB borrowings is affected by both the yield and the structure or term of the borrowing. The 2019 increase was primarily the result of a 45 basis point increase in average rate paid on FHLB borrowings and a 25 basis point increase in the average rate paid on Junior subordinated debentures, partially offset by a 6% decrease in average balance of FHLB borrowings and other. The 2020 decrease in the average rates paid was primarily driven by the decreases in benchmark interest rates to which the instruments are tied. The 2019 increase in average rates paid were the result of increases in market interest rates. The 2020 decrease in the average balance for FHLB borrowings and other was primarily driven by the repayment of FHLB borrowings in 2020, as the increase in deposits was used to pay down higher cost borrowings.\nManagement performed its annual goodwill impairment testing during the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019 for the Wealth Management and Trust reporting unit. Based on the qualitative assessments, there was no indication of impairment. For information regarding the 2020 goodwill impairment testing, see Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 8: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.\u201d\nInvestment management fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $6.3 million, a decrease of $3.9 million, or 38%, from the same period in 2019, compared to a decrease of $11.6 million, or 53%, from 2018 to 2019. The decrease in revenue in 2020 was primarily driven by negative net flows at DGHM. The decrease in revenue in 2019 was primarily driven by the sale of Anchor in the second quarter of 2018 and a decrease in fee income at DGHM.\n\u2022Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $233.4 million, an increase of $5.4 million, or 2%, compared to 2019. The increase was primarily driven by lower funding costs and the addition of PPP-related income, partially offset by lower interest rates on interest-earning assets. NIM decreased 11 basis points to 2.69% in 2020 from 2.80% in 2019. The decrease in NIM in 2020 was driven primarily by lower yields on interest-earning assets and higher volumes of interest-earning assets, primarily excess cash balances held at lower rates due to higher deposit levels, partially offset by lower funding costs.\n\u2022 Trends in volume and terms of loans\nInterest income on Home equity loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2.9 million, a decrease of $1.5 million, or 33%, compared to 2019, after remaining flat in 2019 from 2018. The 2020 decrease was driven by a 147 basis point decrease in average yield and a 5% decrease in the average balance. The 2020 decrease in the average yield was primarily the result of decreases to the interest rate benchmarks to which the variable rate loans are tied. The 2019 increase in the average yield was primarily driven by the impact of the timing of benchmark interest rate increases in 2018 compared to the timing of benchmark interest rate cuts in 2019. The 2020 decrease in the average balance was primarily driven by reduced demand as a result of economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2019 decrease in the average balance was primarily due to decreases in client demand given the increase in interest rates as the loans are lines of credit.\nCommercial Real Estate Second Loan Program\nThe Allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the inherent risk of loss in the loan portfolio as of the Consolidated Balance Sheet dates. Management estimates the level of the Allowance for loan losses based on all relevant information available.\nGeographic concentration. The following tables present the Bank's outstanding loan balance concentrations as of the dates indicated based on the location of the regional offices to which they are attributed.\nRepurchase agreements increased $0.1 million to $53.5 million at December 31, 2020 from $53.4 million at December 31, 2019. Repurchase agreements are generally linked to Commercial demand deposit accounts with an overnight sweep feature.\nInterest income on Commercial real estate loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $99.7 million, a decrease of $15.8 million, or 14%, compared to 2019, after increasing $3.5 million, or 3%, in 2019 from 2018. The 2020 decrease was primarily driven by an 87 basis point decrease in average yield, partially offset by a 6% increase in average balance. The 2019 increase was primarily driven by a 6 basis point increase in average yield and a 2% increase in average balance. The 2020 decrease in the average yield was primarily the result of decreases to the interest rate benchmarks to which the variable rate loans are tied and lower yields on loan originations. The 2019 increase in the average yield was primarily driven by the impact of the timing of benchmark interest rate increases in 2018 compared to the timing of benchmark interest rate cuts in 2019. The 2020 increase in the average balance was related primarily to the addition of approximately $80.0 million of loans under the Commercial real estate second loan program in the second quarter of 2020 as part of the relief measures provided to clients as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2019 increase in the average balance was primarily driven by organic growth, primarily in the Southern California and Northern California regions.\nRestructuring expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was zero, compared to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as part of an efficiency program guided by a focus on improving operating efficiency and sustained earnings enhancement. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2: Restructuring\u201d for further detail.\n2016-13 as of January 1, 2020, the Allowance for loan losses was determined under the incurred loss model. Refer to Part II. Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" for a description of the methodology.\nResidential loans. While the Bank has no minimum size for mortgage loans, it concentrates its origination activities in the Jumbo\u201d segment of the market. This segment consists of loans secured by single-family and one- to four-unit properties in excess of the amount eligible for purchase by the Federal National Mortgage Association, which was $510 thousand at December 31, 2020 for the General\u201d limit and $766 thousand for single-family properties for the High-Cost\u201d limit, depending on from which specific geographic region of the Bank's primary market areas the loan originated. The majority of the Bank's Residential loan portfolio, including jumbo mortgage loans, is adjustable rate mortgages (\"ARMs\"). The ARM loans the Bank originates generally have a fixed interest rate for the first three to ten years and then adjust annually based on a market index such as U.S. Treasury or LIBOR yields. ARM loans may negatively impact the Bank's interest income when they reprice if yields on U.S. Treasuries or LIBOR are lower than the yields at the time of origination. If rates reset higher, the Bank could see increased delinquencies if clients' ability to make payments is impacted by the higher payments.\nNet Interest Income and Margin\nLease liabilities decreased $4.9 million, or 4%, to $112.3 million at December 31, 2020 from $117.2 million at December 31, 2019 due to lease payments, and lease modifications, partially offset by the addition of new or renewed real estate leases and new equipment leases during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Upon adoption of the lease accounting standard discussed above, the Company recognized $124.1 million of Lease liabilities on the face of the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 1, 2019. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7: Premises, Equipment, and Leases.\u201d\nNo impairment losses were recognized through earnings related to investment securities during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The amount of investment securities in an unrealized loss position greater than 12 months, as well as the total amount of unrealized losses, was primarily due to changes in interest rates since the securities were purchased and not due to credit quality or other risk factors.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\n(2) Average loans include loans held for sale and nonaccrual loans.\n________________________\nMarketing and business development expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $6.3 million, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 2%, from the same period in 2019, compared to a decrease of $1.2 million, or 16%, from 2018 to 2019. The 2020 decrease was primarily driven by lower travel and business development expenses, partially offset by higher marketing program expense. The 2019 decrease was primarily driven by lower travel and business development expenses.\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nNet interest income represents the difference between interest earned, primarily on loans and investments, and interest paid on funding sources, primarily deposits and borrowings. Interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield earned on total interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on total interest-bearing liabilities. NIM is the amount of Net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. The average yield earned on earning assets is the amount of annualized interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities is equal to annualized interest expense as a percentage of average interest-bearing liabilities. When credit quality declines and loans are placed on nonaccrual status, NIM can decrease because the same assets are earning less income. $106.9 million of loans that were graded substandard but were still accruing interest income at December 31, 2020 could be placed on nonaccrual status if their credit quality declines further.\nrate, or as a practical expedient, impairment may be determined based upon the observable market price of the loan, or the fair value of the collateral, less estimated costs to sell, if the loan is collateral dependent.\u201d A loan is collateral dependent if repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral or sale of the underlying collateral. For collateral dependent loans, appraisals are generally used to determine the fair value. When a collateral dependent loan becomes impaired, an updated appraisal of the collateral is obtained, if appropriate. Appraised values are generally discounted for factors such as the Bank's intention to liquidate the property quickly in a foreclosure sale or the date when the appraisal was performed if the Bank believes that collateral values have declined since the date the appraisal was done. The Bank may use a broker opinion of value in addition to an appraisal to validate the appraised value. In certain instances, the Bank may consider broker opinions of value as well as other qualitative factors while an appraisal is being prepared.\n\nOther expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $15.5 million, an increase of $1.6 million, or 11%, from the same period in 2019, compared to a decrease of $0.2 million, or 2%, from 2018 to 2019. The 2020 increase in Other expense was primarily driven by an increase to the reserve for unfunded loan commitments. The overall change in the reserve was driven by a change in Allowance for loan losses methodology, an increase in the reserve ratios as a result of the current reasonable and supportable economic forecasts due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and an increase in the balance of loan commitments. The 2019 decrease in Other expense was primarily driven by lower operational losses and other miscellaneous expense.\nGoodwill is subject to annual impairment testing, or more frequently, if there is indication of impairment, based on guidance in ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. Long-lived intangible assets such as advisory contracts are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment ( ASC 360\u201d).\nInterest income on PPP loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $7.8 million. The Company\nThe Company had no intent to sell any securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2020, and it was not more likely than not that the Company would be forced to sell any of these securities prior to the full recovery of all unrealized losses.\n\u2022 Volume and trend of past-due, non-accrual, and adversely-graded loans\nTotal assets. Total assets increased $1.2 billion, or 14%, to $10.0 billion at December 31, 2020 from $8.8 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in client deposits in 2020 which generated additional liquidity.\nnm - not meaningful\n\nLoans. Total portfolio loans increased $127.6 million, or 2%, to $7.1 billion, or 71% of total assets, at December 31, 2020, from $7.0 billion, or 79% of total assets, at December 31, 2019. The following table presents a summary of the loan portfolio based on the portfolio segment and changes in balances as of the dates indicated:\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements, the notes thereto, and other statistical information included in this Annual Report.\nDeferred income taxes, net, decreased $4.6 million, or 40%, to $6.8 million at December 31, 2020 from $11.4 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the current year tax effect of Other comprehensive income of $9.5 million and the tax effect of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 of $5.5 million, partially offset by the deferred tax benefit of $10.4 million which was primarily related to the additional Allowance for loan losses. At December 31, 2020, no valuation\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank initiated a Residential mortgage and Home equity line loan deferment program under which principal and interest payments on qualifying loans are generally deferred for initially three months and the loan term is extended three months; if requested, the loan may be deferred for a subsequent three months. Loans\nThe Company recognized Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $0.55 per share, compared to $0.97 per share and $0.90 per share in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Diluted earnings per share attributable to common shareholders, which includes both continuing and discontinued operations, if any, for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $0.55 per share, compared to earnings of $0.97 per share and $0.92 per share in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net income from continuing operations in 2020 and 2019 was positively impacted by decreases in the redemption value of certain redeemable noncontrolling interests, which increased income available to common shareholders. Net income from continuing operations in 2018 was partially offset by dividends paid on preferred stock, net of a decrease in the redemption value of certain redeemable noncontrolling interests. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16: Earnings Per Share\u201d for further detail on the charges made to arrive at income attributable to common shareholders.\n(1) Investments classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity are shown in the average balance sheet at amortized cost.\nThe increase in Net income attributable to the Company from 2018 to 2019 was primarily driven by a decrease in Total operating expense of $7.4 million, primarily due to a decrease in Restructuring expense, a decrease in Salaries and employee benefits expense, and a Provision credit for loan losses of $3.6 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in Income tax expense of $2.8 million and a decrease in Total revenue of $1.7 million, primarily due to lower Net interest income.\nExecutive Summary\nLoan portfolio composition. The following table presents the outstanding loan balances by class of receivable as of the dates indicated and the percent of each category to total loans.\nAccrued interest receivable amounts are excluded from balances of loans held at amortized cost and are included within Accrued interest receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management has elected not to measure an Allowance for loan losses on these amounts as the Company employs a timely write-off policy as generally any loan over 89 days past-due is put on non-accrual status and any associated accrued interest is reversed.\n\u2022 Concentration risk\nCommercial and Industrial Loan Deferment Program\nNet interest income. Net interest income increased 2% from 2019 to 2020, after decreasing 3% from 2018 to 2019. The increase in Net interest income in 2020 was primarily driven by lower funding costs and the addition of PPP-related income, partially offset by lower interest on interest-earning assets. The decrease in Net interest income in 2019 was primarily driven by an increase in the average rate paid on deposits, partially offset by higher yields and higher average balances of loans, and a decrease in the average balance of borrowings. These changes are discussed in more detail below.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2020, the Company made a change to the loan portfolio segmentation in which\nCommercial and industrial and Commercial tax-exempt loans were bifurcated given their different underlying risk\nnm - not meaningful\nBorrowings. Total borrowings, which consists of Securities sold under agreements to repurchase; Federal funds purchased, if any; FHLB borrowings; and Junior subordinated debentures, decreased $236.1 million, or 46%, to $274.5 million at December 31, 2020 from $510.6 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by the use of deposits to pay down higher cost borrowings.\nallowance on the net deferred tax asset was required primarily due to the ability to generate future taxable income. The Company does not have any capital losses in excess of capital gains as of December 31, 2020.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nUnder the Current Expected Credit Losses (\"CECL\") methodology, which the Company adopted on January 1, 2020, the Company estimates credit losses on a collective basis for loans sharing similar risk characteristics using a quantitative model combined with an assessment of certain qualitative factors designed to address risks not incorporated in the quantitative model output. The quantitative model utilizes economic factors and our selected peer groups' historical default and loss experience evaluated over the historical observation period to estimate expected credit losses. The expected credit losses are the product of multiplying the Company's estimates of probability of default, net loss given default, and individual loan level exposure at default on an undiscounted basis. The model estimates expected credit losses using loan level data over the contractual life of the exposure, considering the effect of estimated prepayment and curtailment rates, both of which are derived from the Company's recent historical experience on the remaining portfolio segment balance over the life of the portfolio. Reasonable and supportable economic forecasts are incorporated into the estimate over a reasonable and supportable forecast period, beyond which is a reversion to the Company's historical long-run average of the macroeconomic variables, such as Gross Domestic Product, Unemployment, Consumer Confidence Index etc. Management has determined a reasonable and supportable period of two years and a straight line reversion period of twelve months to be appropriate for purposes of estimating expected credit losses. Management also applies a weight to the various forecasts to determine the reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. A portion of the collective Allowance for loan losses is related to the qualitative factors used to adjust historical loss information for asset-specific characteristics and current conditions to the extent they are not captured sufficiently in the quantitative model. The qualitative factors are based on information not reflected in the quantitative models but are likely to impact the measurement of estimated credit losses. The Company's qualitative assessment includes the following factors:\n____________\nThe Bank specializes in lending to individuals, real estate investors, nonprofit organizations, and middle market businesses, including corporations, partnerships, and associations. Loans made by the Bank to individuals may include Residential mortgage loans and mortgage loans on investment or vacation properties, unsecured and secured personal lines of credit, home equity loans, and overdraft protection. Loans made by the Bank to businesses include commercial and mortgage loans, revolving lines of credit, working capital loans, equipment financing, community lending programs, and construction and land loans. The types and sizes of loans the Bank originates are limited by regulatory requirements.\nThe following table presents selected financial highlights:\nDeposits. Deposits increased $1.4 billion, or 19%, to $8.6 billion, at December 31, 2020 from $7.2 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase was driven by increased deposits from new and existing clients throughout the year. Deposits are the principal source of the Bank's funds for use in lending, investments, and liquidity. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10: Deposits\u201d for further information.\nInterest income on Residential mortgage loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $89.7 million, a decrease of $11.4 million, or 11%, compared to 2019, after increasing $8.2 million, or 9%, in 2019 from 2018. The 2020 decrease was primarily driven by a 20 basis point decrease in average yield and a 6% decrease in average balance. The 2019 increase was primarily driven by a 6% increase in average balance and an 8 basis point increase in average yield. The 2020 decrease in the average yield was primarily the result of decreases to the interest rate benchmarks to which the variable rate loans are tied and lower yields on loan originations. The 2019 increase in the average yield was primarily driven by new loans being originated at higher interest rates. The 2020 decrease in the average balance was primarily driven by the sale of approximately $72.0 million of Residential loans in the third quarter of 2020. The 2019 increase in the average balance was primarily driven by organic growth of the Residential loan portfolio, specifically in the New England and Southern California markets, partially offset by the sale of $190.7 million of Residential loans in 2019.\nROU assets at December 31, 2020 decreased $4.2 million, or 4%, to $97.9 million at December 31, 2020 from $102.1 million at December 31, 2019 due to amortization of ROU assets, lease expirations that were not renewed, and lease modifications, partially offset by the addition of real estate leases and equipment leases during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Upon adoption of the lease accounting standard, ASU 2016-02, the Company recognized $108.5 million of ROU assets on the face of the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 1, 2019. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7: Premises, Equipment, and Leases.\u201d\nRate-Volume Analysis\n\u2022Total operating expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $241.3 million, an increase of $11.1 million, or 5%, from 2019. The increase was primarily driven by increases in Information systems expense as a result of new information technology (\"IT\") initiatives placed into service, Salaries and employee benefits expense, and the reserve for unfunded loan commitments within Other expense, partially offset by decreases in Restructuring expense and Professional services expense.\nThe Bank's loans are affected by the economic and real estate markets in which they are located. Generally, Commercial real estate, and Construction and land loans are affected more than Residential mortgage loans in an economic downturn. The ability to grow the loan portfolio is partially related to the Bank's ability to increase deposit levels. If, as a result of general economic conditions, market interest rates, competitive pressures, or otherwise, the amount of deposits at the Bank decreases, the Bank may be limited in its ability to grow its loan portfolio or may have to rely more heavily on higher cost borrowings as a source of funds in the future. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Bank sold $72.0 million of Residential mortgage loans driven by Asset-Liability Management (\"ALM\") consideration and anticipated deposit levels.\nConstruction and land loans. Construction and land loans include loans for financing of new developments as well as financing for improvements to existing buildings. In addition, tax-exempt construction and land loans are provided for the construction phase of the Commercial tax-exempt and Commercial real estate tax-exempt loans described above.\nDiscussion of Noninterest Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\nFrom time to time, the Company purchases Federal funds from the FHLB and other banking institutions to supplement its liquidity position. The Company had no outstanding Federal funds purchased at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. FHLB borrowings decreased $236.2 million, or 67%, to $114.7 million at December 31, 2020 from $350.8 million at December 31, 2019. FHLB borrowings are generally used to provide additional funding for loan growth when the rate of loan growth exceeds deposit growth and to manage interest rate risk, but can also be used as an additional source of liquidity for the Bank. Given the higher deposits and cash balances at December 31, 2020, there was less need for additional liquidity from the purchase of Federal funds or FHLB borrowings. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company used additional liquidity to pay down $61.5 million of long-term FHLB borrowings, thereby incurring FHLB prepayment penalties of $0.4 million.\nThere have been no significant changes to judgments in determining the fair value of assets or liabilities, and there have been no material impairments of financial assets. The Company will continue to monitor the fair value of assets to determine if trigger events exist to warrant further impairment testing.\n_______________\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank also initiated a program to offer qualifying Commercial real estate borrowers a second mortgage to cover up to one year of principal and interest payments. In order to qualify for the loan, the total exposure after receiving the second mortgage for each borrower could not exceed a 75% loan-to-value ratio, and the loans were required to be current at the time of application, amongst other conditions. In total, borrowers with approximately 240 existing loans totaling $1.3 billion requested and were approved for these second mortgages, representing approximately 50% of the Commercial real estate loan balance. As of December 31, 2020, the borrowers associated with the $1.3 billion of existing loans had an outstanding balance of approximately $72.0 million. The Company does not anticipate a material increase in the program balance of new loans in the future, and the principal balance will amortize down over the life of the loan, generally five years. In addition to, and outside of the Commercial real estate second loan program, the Bank offered qualified Commercial real estate borrowers principal payment deferral for up to 12 months, with the deferred principal added to the balance due at maturity. In total, 13 Commercial real estate borrowers with loans totaling $49.0 million accepted this accommodation. As of December 31, 2020, deferrals for 10 borrowers with loans totaling $40.3 million have expired with the loans returning to payment, while 3 borrowers with loans totaling approximately $8.7 million remain in deferral. Of the loans that came off deferral, no loans are delinquent on payment terms as of December 31, 2020. The entire Commercial real estate portfolio will continue to be monitored for credit deterioration regardless of their participation in the plan.\n______________________\nGoodwill and intangible assets, net. Goodwill and intangible assets, net decreased $1.3 million, or 2%, to $66.7 million at December 31, 2020 from $68.0 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by the Amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by an increase in the addition of servicing rights of $1.4 million. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 8: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d for a discussion of the annual goodwill impairment testing.\nThe interest rates charged on loans vary with the degree of risk, maturity, and amount of the loan and are further subject to competitive pressures, market rates, the availability of funds, and legal and regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2020, approximately 60% of the Bank's outstanding loans due after one year had interest rates that were either floating or adjustable in nature. See Part II.\n\nnm - not meaningful\n\u2022 Banking industry conditions, other external factors, and inherent model risk\nThe Bank makes a determination of the applicable loss rate for these factors based on relevant local market conditions, credit quality, and portfolio mix. Each quarter, management reviews the loss factors to determine if there have been any changes in its loan portfolio, market conditions, or other risk indicators which would result in a change to the current loss factor.\n\n\u2022Average total loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $7.2 billion, an increase of 3% from 2019, driven primarily by the addition of PPP loans and an increase in Commercial real estate loans, partially offset by a decrease in Residential loans due to the $72.0 million of Residential loan sales in the third quarter of 2020.\n(1)With the integration of KLS into Boston Private Wealth in the third quarter of 2019, the results of KLS are included in the Wealth Management and Trust segment for all periods. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 3: Divestitures\u201d for additional information.\nOther income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2.2 million, a decrease of $0.8 million, or 26%, from the same period in 2019, compared to an increase of $2.1 million, from 2018 to 2019. The decrease in 2020 was primarily driven by the impact of the market value adjustment on derivatives and the value of the rabbi trust securities related to the Company's deferred compensation plan, partially offset by an increase in miscellaneous income primarily due to the addition of servicing rights related to the Residential loan sales in the third quarter of 2020 and the Federal Reserve's Main Street Lending Program. The increase in 2019 was primarily driven by an increase in the value of the rabbi trust securities related to the Company's deferred compensation plan and an increase in miscellaneous income.\n____________\n\nThe following discussions are based on the Company's continuing operations, unless otherwise stated.\nWhile this evaluation process utilizes historical and other objective information, the classification of loans and the establishment of the Allowance for loan losses rely to a great extent on the judgment and experience of management. While management evaluates currently available information in establishing the Allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the Allowance for loan losses may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluations. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review a financial institution's Allowance for loan losses as well as loan grades/classifications.\nInvestment income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $24.7 million, a decrease of $2.2 million, or 8%, compared to 2019, after also decreasing $3.5 million, or 12%, in 2019 from 2018. The 2020 decrease was the result of a 71 basis point decrease in the average yield, partially offset by a 31% increase in the average balance. The 2019 decrease was the result of a 16% decrease in the average balance, partially offset by an 11 basis point increase in the average yield. The decrease in the average yield in 2020 was primarily due to the lower interest rate environment. The increase in the average yield in 2019 was primarily driven by increases in the federal discount rate and higher dividends paid on FHLB stock. The increase in Total cash and investments average balance in 2020 was primarily due to additional cash from higher client deposit balances. The decrease in Total cash and investments average balance in 2019 was primarily driven by the use of investment and other cash flows to fund loan growth instead of reinvesting in additional investment securities in response to a flattening yield curve.\nFor periods disclosed prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13 as of January 1, 2020, the Allowance for loan losses was determined under the incurred loss model. Upon the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, management's processes for the Allowance for loan losses has changed. The updates in this standard replace the incurred loss impairment methodology, previously accounted for in accordance with Receivables ( ASC 310\u201d) and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 102 (July 2001), with the updated methodology described below that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for further details.\nAnnounced Acquisition\nInformation systems expense consists of contract servicing, computer hardware and software charges, and technology service agreements. Information systems expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $29.6 million, an increase of $6.9 million, or 31%, from the same period in 2019, compared to a decrease of $2.5 million, or 10%, from 2018 to 2019. The increase in 2020 was primarily driven by information technology initiatives placed into service and an increase in costs related to building out remote working capabilities in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in 2019 was primarily due to lower telecommunications expense as a result of previously-enacted efficiency initiatives and the impact of the sales of Anchor and BOS, partially offset by an increase in technology service agreements related to new technology initiatives.\nDeposits at the Bank increased $1.4 billion, or 19%, to $8.7 billion at December 31, 2020 from $7.3 billion at December 31, 2019. A discussion of the Company's deposits can be found below in Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Condition.\u201d\nIf the loan is deemed to be collateral dependent, generally the difference between the book balance (client balance less any prior charge-offs or client interest payments applied to principal) and the fair value of the collateral is taken as a partial charge-off through the Allowance for loan losses in the current period. If the loan is not determined to be collateral dependent, then a specific allocation to the general reserve is established for the difference between the book balance of the loan and the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate. Charge-offs for loans not considered to be collateral dependent are made when it is determined a loss has been incurred. Impaired loans are removed from the general loan pools. There may be instances where the loan is considered impaired although based on the fair value of underlying collateral or the discounted expected future cash flows there is no impairment to be recognized. In addition, all loans which are classified as TDRs are considered impaired.\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $233.4 million, an increase of $5.4 million, or 2%, compared to 2019, after a decrease of $6.5 million, or 3%, from 2018 to 2019. The increase in Net interest income in 2020 was primarily driven by lower funding costs and the addition of PPP-related income, partially offset by lower interest rates on interest-earning assets. The decrease in Net interest income in 2019 was primarily driven by an increase in rates paid on deposits and borrowings, partially offset by increased yields and volumes on loans. NIM was 2.69%, 2.80%, and 2.92% for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\n\u2022 Experience and depth of management\nTotal operating expense. Total operating expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $241.3 million, an increase of $11.1 million, or 5%, from the same period in 2019, compared to a decrease of $37.1 million, or 14%, from 2018 to 2019. The increase in 2020 was primarily driven by increases in Information systems expense, Salaries and employee benefits expense, and the reserve for unfunded loan commitments within Other expense, partially offset by decreases in Restructuring expense, Professional services expense, and Occupancy and equipment expense. The decrease in 2019 was primarily driven by the impact of the sales of Anchor and BOS, lower Salaries and employee benefits expense, and lower Information systems expense. See below for additional information on expense drivers.\nCash and investments. Total cash and investments (consisting of Cash and cash equivalents, Investment securities available-for-sale, Investment securities held-to-maturity, Equity securities at fair value, and Stock in the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank) increased $1.0 billion, or 75%, to $2.4 billion, or 24% of Total assets at December 31, 2020 from $1.4 billion, or 16% of Total assets at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in Cash and cash equivalents of $0.8 billion, an increase in Investment securities available-for-sale of $265.4 million, or 27%, and an increase in Equity securities of $22.6 million, partially offset by a decrease in Investment securities held-to-maturity securities of $13.0 million, or 27%, and a decrease in FHLB stock of $10.4 million, or 27%. The increase in Cash and investments was driven by an increase in client deposits throughout the year which were primarily invested in cash and investment securities.\nCommercial tax-exempt loans. Commercial tax-exempt loans include loans to not-for-profit private schools, colleges, and public charter schools.\nOther Accounting Matters\nThe following table describes the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities have affected the Company's interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. Information is provided in each category with respect to: (i) changes attributable to changes in volumes (changes in average balance multiplied by prior year average yield/rate) and (ii) changes attributable to changes in yield/rate\nThe following table presents a summary of selected financial data for the Wealth Management and Trust segment for 2020, 2019, and 2018.\nConsumer and other loans. Consumer and other loans consist of balances outstanding on consumer loans including personal lines of credit, and loans arising from overdraft protection extended to individual and business clients. Personal lines of credit are typically for high net worth clients whose assets may not be liquid due to investments, closely held stock or restricted stock. The amount of Consumer and other loans typically depends on client demand.\nThe Provision/(credit) for loan losses is determined as a result of the required level of the Allowance for loan losses, estimated by management, which reflects the inherent risk of loss in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet dates. The Company estimates credit losses on a collective basis for loans sharing similar risk characteristics using a quantitative model combined with an assessment of certain qualitative factors designed to address forecast risk and model risk inherent in the quantitative model output. The quantitative model utilizes a factor-based approach to estimate expected credit losses using probability of default and loss given default, which are derived from a selected peer group's historical default and loss experience. The model estimates expected credit losses using loan level data over the contractual life of the exposure, considering the effect of prepayments and curtailments. Economic forecasts are incorporated into the estimate over a reasonable and supportable forecast period, beyond which is a reversion to the Company's historical long-run average. Qualitative factors are estimated by management and include trends in problem loans, strength of management, concentration risk and underwriting standards. For further details, see Part II. Item 7.

For periods disclosed prior to the adoption of ASU\n\nto lower revolving line of credit usage. The 2019 increase in the average balance was primarily driven by organic growth, primarily in the New England region.\n(change in average interest rate multiplied by prior year average balance), while (iii) changes attributable to the combined impact of volumes and rates have been allocated proportionately to separate volume and rate categories.\nTotal loans at the Bank increased $0.1 billion, or 2%, to $7.1 billion at December 31, 2020 from $7.0 billion at December 31, 2019. Total loans were 71% of Total assets at the Bank as of December 31, 2020, compared to 80% of Total assets at December 31, 2019. A discussion of the Company's loan portfolio can be found below in Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Loan Portfolio and Credit Quality.\u201d\nAUM increased $1.4 billion, or 9%, to $16.6 billion at December 31, 2020 from $15.2 billion at December 31, 2019. In 2020, the increase in AUM was driven by favorable market returns of $1.3 billion and positive net flows of $0.1 billion. In 2019, the $1.0 billion increase in AUM from 2018 was primarily driven by favorable market returns of $2.0 billion, partially offset by net outflows of $1.0 billion. The decrease in Total revenue of 4% from the prior year is driven primarily by a reduction in the average effective fee rate.\nA loan is considered impaired in accordance with ASC 326 when, based upon current information and events, it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impairment is measured based on the fair value of the loan, expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest\nThe following table presents a summary of selected financial data for the Private Banking segment for 2020, 2019, and 2018.\nIncome tax expense. Income tax expense for continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $8.9 million, a decrease of $13.7 million, or 61%, from the same period in 2019, compared to a decrease of $14.9 million, or 40%, from 2018 to 2019. The effective tax rate for continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 16.4%, compared to effective tax rates of 21.9% and 31.4% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2020 was lower than 2019 primarily due to the lower level of income in 2020 as compared to 2019. The effective tax rate for 2019 was lower than 2018 primarily due to the Income tax expense related to the Anchor transaction closing in 2018. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 17: Income Taxes\u201d for further detail.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and continues to cause, substantial disruptions to the global economy and to the customers and communities that we serve. In response to the pandemic, the Company implemented business continuity contingency plans, including company-wide remote working arrangements. We are also focused on supporting our clients who may be experiencing a financial hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including by participating in the SBA's PPP and offering loan deferrals and forbearance as needed, including our Residential mortgage and Home equity line loan deferment program and Commercial and industrial loan deferment program, and creating the Commercial real estate second loan program. We will continue to evaluate this fluid situation and take additional actions as necessary.\nInvestment securities available-for-sale and Investment securities held-to-maturity maturities, calls, principal payments, and sales, if any, net of purchases of investment securities used $227.8 million of cash during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $66.1 million of cash generated for the year ended December 31, 2019. Equity securities investment sales, net of investment purchases decreased cash by $22.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a decrease in cash of $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Proceeds from investment securities are generally used to fund a portion of loan growth, pay down borrowings or purchase new investments. The timing of sales and reinvestments is based on various factors, including management's evaluation of interest rate trends, credit risk, and the Company's liquidity. The Company's portfolio of Investment securities available-for-sale carried a total of $45.8 million of unrealized gains and $0.6 million of unrealized losses at December 31, 2020, compared to $15.0 million of unrealized gains and $3.6 million of unrealized losses at December 31, 2019. For information regarding the weighted average yield and maturity of investments, see Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4: Investment Securities.\u201d\nThe following table summarizes the Company's carrying value of Investment securities available-for-sale, Investment securities held-to-maturity, and Equity securities at fair value as of the dates indicated:\n________________\n(1)Regional percentage totals may not reconcile due to rounding.\n\nThe Company's Private Banking segment reported Net income attributable to the Company of $43.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $72.2 million in 2019 and $68.0 million in 2018. The decrease from 2019 to 2020 was primarily driven by a change in Provision/(credit) for loan losses of $35.6 million and an increase in Total operating expense of $10.1 million, primarily due to increases in Information systems expense, the reserve for unfunded loan commitments within Other expense, and Salaries and employee benefits expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in Income tax expense of $12.5 million and an increase in Total revenue of $3.9 million, primarily due to higher Net interest income.\nAdditionally, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank initiated a program offering qualified Commercial and industrial borrowers principal payment deferral for six months, with the deferred principal added to the last payment. In total, approximately 85 Commercial and industrial loans totaling approximately $125.0 million have been processed under the program. As of December 31, 2020, deferrals for approximately 80 loans totaling approximately $115.0 million have expired with the loans returning to payment, while approximately five loans totaling approximately $10.0 million remain in deferral under the program. Of the loans that came off deferral, no loans are delinquent on payment terms as of December 31, 2020.\nThe Allowance for loan losses consists of two primary components: general reserves on pass, non-impaired special mention, and substandard loans as well as specific reserves on impaired loans. The calculation of the Allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of management judgment and estimates designed to reflect the inherent risk of loss in the loan portfolio at the measurement date The Allowance for loan losses is established based upon the Company's current estimate of expected lifetime credit losses on loans measured at amortized cost.\nCommercial and industrial loans. Commercial and industrial loans include working capital and revolving lines of credit, term loans for equipment and fixed assets, and SBA loans.\n\u2022 Risk surrounding loan review\nFinancial Condition\nResults of Operations\nThe Bank generally has interest income that is either recovered or reversed related to nonaccruing loans each quarter. Based on the net amount recovered or reversed, the impact on interest income and related yields can be either positive or negative. In addition, the Bank collects prepayment penalties on certain Commercial loans that pay off prior to maturity which could also impact interest income and related yields positively. The amount and timing of prepayment penalties varies.\nGain on sale of affiliate for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was zero, compared to a gain of $18.1 million in 2018. As discussed above, the gain of $18.1 million in 2018 relates to the sale of BOS. There were no sales of affiliates in 2020 or 2019.\nthat are deferred under the program are not considered TDRs or past due based on current regulatory guidance. In total, approximately 365 Residential mortgages and Home equity loans totaling approximately $220.0 million have been processed under the program. As of December 31, 2020, deferrals for approximately 300 loans totaling approximately $200.0 million have expired with the loans returning to payment, while approximately 40 loans totaling approximately $15.0 million remain in deferral under the program. Approximately 25 loans totaling approximately $5.0 million are delinquent on payment terms as of December 31, 2020 after the deferral expired, primarily First Time Home Buyer loans.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests. Redeemable noncontrolling interests decreased $1.4 million, or 100%, at December 31, 2020 from the balance at December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to fair value adjustments made throughout 2020 to the estimated maximum redemption value of the Company's sole majority-owned affiliate, DGHM.\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and Discussion\nThe majority of the investments held by the Company are held by the Bank. The Bank's investment policy requires management to maintain a portfolio of securities which will provide liquidity necessary to facilitate funding of loans, to cover deposit fluctuations, and to mitigate the Bank's overall balance sheet exposure to interest rate risk, while at the same time earning a satisfactory return on the funds invested. The securities in which the Bank may invest are subject to regulation and are generally limited to securities that are considered investment grade.\u201d\nPrivate Banking\nThe Company continues to monitor and evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the credit quality of our assets. Total criticized and classified loans as of December 31, 2020 was $318.0 million, a decrease of $4.6 million, or 1%, linked quarter, primarily driven by $39.0 million of loan payoffs, paydowns and upgrades, partially offset by $35.0 million of loan downgrades. Of the $35.0 million of downgrades in the fourth quarter of 2020, $31.0 million were Commercial real estate loans across eight relationships, primarily with retail, office, and hospitality collateral. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company recognized a total net provision credit of $5.4 million primarily driven by an improved economic forecast related to the current expected credit losses methodology, partially offset by increased qualitative reserves for Commercial real estate.\n\n(1)Deposits presented in this table do not include intercompany eliminations related to deposits in the Bank from the Holding Company.\n(1)All Mortgage-backed securities are guaranteed by the U.S. government, U.S. government agencies, or government-sponsored entities.\nSalaries and employee benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $139.7 million, an increase of $5.4 million, or 4%, from the same period in 2019, compared to a decrease of $27.2 million, or 17%, from 2018 to 2019. The increase in 2020 was driven primarily by an increase in salaries due to new hires in line with our strategic objectives. The decrease in 2019 was driven primarily by the impact of the sales of Anchor and BOS as well as realized savings from previously-enacted efficiency initiatives.\nThe Company's Wealth Management and Trust segment reported Net income attributable to the Company of $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $12.2 million in 2019 and $8.9 million in 2018. The decrease in Net income attributable to the Company from 2019 to 2020 was primarily driven by an increase in Total operating expense of $3.6 million primarily due to an increase in Salaries and employee benefits expense and a decrease in Total revenue of $3.2 million from lower fee income. The increase in Net income attributable to the Company from 2018 to 2019 was primarily driven by a decrease in Total operating expense of $8.1 million primarily due to decreases in Salaries and employee benefits expense, Information systems expense, and Restructuring expense, partially offset by a decrease in Total revenue of $3.2 million from lower fees.\nMortgage Deferment Program\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nNet income attributable to the Company was $45.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $80.0 million in 2019 and $80.4 million in 2018. The Company recognized Diluted earnings per share of $0.55 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $0.97 in 2019 and $0.92 in 2018. Key items that affected the Company's 2020 results include:\nThe Company offers a wide range of private banking, wealth management, and trust services to high net worth individuals, families, businesses and select institutions through its two reportable segments: (i) Private Banking and (ii) Wealth Management and Trust. This Executive Summary provides an overview of the most significant aspects of the Company's operating segments and operations. Details of the matters addressed in this summary are provided elsewhere in this document and, in particular, in the sections immediately following.\nThe Company's Allowance for loan losses is accounted for in accordance with guidance issued by various regulatory agencies, including: the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Policy Statement on the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (October 2019); SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 119 (November 2019); ASC 326, Financial Instruments \u2500 Credit Losses (\"ASC 326\"); and ASC 450, Contingencies.\nThe following table presents the composition of the Company's NIM for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.\nTotal interest expense. Total interest expense on deposits and borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $40.3 million, a decrease of $40.1 million, or 50%, compared to 2019, after increasing $22.0 million, or 38%, in 2019 from 2018.\nCommercial real estate loans. Commercial real estate loans are generally acquisition financing for commercial properties such as office buildings, retail properties, apartment buildings, and industrial/warehouse space. In addition, tax-exempt Commercial real estate loans are provided for affordable housing development and rehabilitation. These loans are often supplemented with federal, state, and/or local subsidies.\n\nWealth Management and Trust\nOther liabilities. Other liabilities, which consist primarily of accrued interest, accrued compensation, interest rate derivatives, other accrued expenses, and Lease liabilities, increased $52.8 million, or 20%, to $310.9 million at December 31, 2020 from $258.0 million at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the market value adjustment to derivative liabilities.\n\u2022 Risk surrounding lending policy and underwriting standards\nAs previously announced on January 4, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with SVB pursuant to which SVB will acquire the Company. The transaction has been unanimously approved by both companies' Boards of Directors and is expected to close in mid-2021, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the receipt of customary regulatory approvals and approval by the shareholders of the Company.\n\n\u2022AUM increased $0.3 billion, or 2%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $17.1 billion, primarily driven by favorable market returns of $1.0 billion, partially offset by $0.7 billion of negative net flows.\nThe following tables disclose the scheduled contractual maturities of portfolio loans by class of receivable at December 31, 2020. Loans having no stated maturity are reported as due in one year or less. The following tables also set forth the dollar amounts of loans that are scheduled to mature after one year segregated between fixed and adjustable interest rate loans.\nWealth management and trust fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $72.9 million, a decrease of $2.9 million, or 4%, from the same period in 2019, compared to a decrease of $24.1 million, or 24%, from 2018 to 2019. AUM in the Wealth Management and Trust segment increased $1.4 billion, or 9%, to $16.6 billion at December 31, 2020 from $15.2 billion at December 31, 2019. The AUM increase in 2020 was the result of favorable market returns of $1.3 billion and net inflows of $0.1 billion. The decrease in Wealth management and trust fees in 2020 was driven primarily by a reduction in the average effective fee rate. Fee income from BOS is included within Wealth management and trust fees for the period BOS was owned. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for additional information on the reporting of historical results for Anchor and BOS.\nInterest income on Construction and land loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $8.6 million, a decrease of $1.6 million, or 16%, compared to 2019, after increasing $1.5 million, or 18%, in 2019 from 2018. The 2020 decrease was primarily driven by a 94 basis point decrease in average yield, partially offset by a 4% increase in average balance. The 2019 increase was primarily driven by a 14% increase in average balance and a 12 basis point increase in average yield. The 2020 decrease in the average yield was primarily the result of decreases to the interest rate benchmarks to which the variable rate loans are tied. The 2019 increase in the average yield were primarily driven by the impact of the timing of benchmark interest rate increases in 2018 compared to the timing of benchmark interest rate cuts in 2019. The 2020 increase in the average balance was related primarily to line drawdowns, primarily in Southern California. The 2019 increase in average balance was primarily driven by organic fluctuations in a small number of large balance loans which show as large percentage changes given the relative size of the total loan balance.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\nInterest income on Commercial and industrial loans (including Commercial loans and Commercial tax-exempt loans), for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $37.3 million, a decrease of $7.7 million, or 17%, compared to 2019, after an increase of $7.0 million, or 18%, in 2019 from 2018. The 2020 decrease was primarily driven by a 58 basis point decrease in average yield and a 3% decrease in the average balance. The 2019 increase was primarily driven by a 12% increase in the average balance and a 22 basis point increase in average yield. The 2020 decrease in the average yield was primarily the result of decreases to the interest rate benchmarks to which the variable rate loans are tied and lower yields on loan originations. The 2019 change in the average yield was primarily driven by the impact of the timing of benchmark interest rate increases in 2018 compared to the timing of benchmark interest rate cuts in 2019. The 2020 decrease in the average balance was related primarily\nHome equity loans. Home equity loans consist of balances outstanding on second mortgages and home equity lines of credit extended to individual clients. The amount of Home equity loans typically depends on client demand.\ncharacteristics. Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, the Company also added a segment for PPP loans originated. For the\nProvision/(credit) for loan losses. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Provision/(credit) for loan losses was an expense of $32.0 million, compared to credits of $3.6 million and $2.2 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The 2020 Provision for loan losses was primarily driven by the change in Allowance for loan losses methodology from the incurred loss model to the current expected credit loss model, the current reasonable and supportable economic forecast deterioration as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the net change in qualitative factors to account for risks and assumptions related to our loan portfolio not incorporated in the forecasts. The 2019 credit to the Provision for loan losses was primarily driven by a net decrease in criticized and classified loans and an improvement in loss factors, partially offset by loan growth and a change in loan mix and loan volume. The 2018 credit to the provision for loan losses was primarily driven by net recoveries, an improvement in loss factors, and a decrease in criticized loans, partially offset by loan growth and the composition of the loan portfolio.\nCertificates of deposit in denominations of $100,000 or greater had the following schedule of maturities:\n\nThe Company's NIM decreased 11 basis points to 2.69% in 2020 from 2.80% in 2019, after decreasing 12 basis points in 2019 from 2.92% in 2018. Although Net interest income increased, the decrease in the Company's Net interest margin in 2020 was driven primarily by lower yields on interest-earning assets and higher volumes of interest-earning assets, primarily excess cash balances held at lower rates, partially offset by lower funding costs. The decrease in the Company's NIM in 2019 was primarily driven by the increased cost of deposits and borrowings, partially offset by higher yields on the loan portfolio and interest recoveries on previously nonaccrual loans as loan yields increased at a slower rate than deposits and borrowings.\nbegan earning interest income on PPP loans in the second quarter of 2020. Interest income on PPP loans includes interest earned on the loans and the accretion of origination fees over the life of the loans. If a loan is forgiven or otherwise paid off, the remainder of the processing fee will be accreted through Net interest income. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $62.2 million of loans were forgiven by the SBA, and a total of $5.1 million was accreted through Net interest income.\nInterest expense on deposits for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $32.0 million, a decrease of $27.1 million, or 46%, compared to 2019, after increasing $19.2 million, or 48%, in 2019 from 2018. The 2020 decrease was primarily driven by a 64 basis point decrease in average rate paid on deposits, partially offset by a 12% increase in the average balance of total deposits. The 2019 increase was primarily driven by a 38 basis point increase in average rate paid on deposits and a 4% increase in the average balance of total deposits. The decrease in the average yield in 2020 was primarily driven by wholesale reductions in rates paid for deposit accounts given decreases in interest rates as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in the average yield in 2019 was primarily driven by the increase in rates in 2018, which carry forward for much of 2019, impacting all deposit types, specifically Money market deposits and Certificates of deposits, and was primarily driven by increases to market interest rates. The 2020 increase in the average balance was driven by an increase in new and existing client deposits primarily in Money market and NOW accounts, partially offset by a decrease in Certificates of deposits. The 2019 increase in the average balance was driven by increases to Money market deposits and Certificates of deposit accounts.\nLoans held for sale. Loans held for sale increased $10.0 million to $17.4 million at December 31, 2020 from $7.4 million at December 31, 2019. The balance of Loans held for sale relates to the timing and volume of Residential loans originated for sale and the ultimate sale transaction, which is typically executed within a short period of time following the loan origination.\nLoans that no longer share similar risk characteristics with any pools of assets are subject to individual assessment and are removed from the collectively assessed pools to avoid double counting. For the loans that will be individually assessed, the Company will use either a discounted cash flow (\"DCF\") approach or a fair value of collateral approach. The latter approach will be used for loans deemed to be collateral dependent or when foreclosure is probable.\nUpon the adoption of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) (\"ASU 2016-13\") on January 1, 2020, management's processes for the Allowance for loan losses has changed. The updates in this standard replace the incurred loss impairment methodology, previously accounted for in accordance with Receivables ( ASC 310\u201d) while maintaining SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 102 (July 2001), with the Current Expected Credit Losses model methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates.\nNet income. The Company recorded Net income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $45.2 million, compared to Net income from continuing operations of $80.4 million and $81.9 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net income attributable to the Company, which includes income from both continuing and discontinued operations, if any, less Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $45.2 million, compared to income of $80.0 million and $80.4 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nChanges to the required level in the Allowance for loan losses result in either a Provision for loan losses, if an increase is required, or a Provision credit for loan losses, if a decrease is required. Loan losses are charged to the Allowance for loan losses when available information confirms that specific loans, or portions thereof, are uncollectible. Recoveries on loans previously charged-off are credited to the Allowance for loan losses when received in cash or when the Bank takes possession of other assets.\nInterest income on Other consumer loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $3.2 million, a decrease of $2.3 million, or 42%, compared to 2019, after also decreasing $1.1 million, or 17%, in 2019 from 2018. The 2020 decrease was primarily the result of a 162 basis point decrease in the average yield and a 6% decrease in the average balance. The 2019 decrease was primarily the result of a 22% decrease in the average balance, partially offset by a 28 basis point increase in the average yield. The 2020 decrease in the average yield was primarily the result of decreases to the interest rate benchmarks to which the variable rate loans are tied. The 2019 increase in the average yield was primarily driven by the impact of the timing of benchmark interest rate increases in 2018 compared to the timing of benchmark interest rate cuts in 2019. The 2020 decrease in the average balance was primarily driven by a strategic decision to slow new consumer loan growth. The 2019 decrease in average balance was primarily due to changes in client demand.\nPaycheck Protection Program. PPP loans are loans made under the PPP as stipulated through the CARES Act.\nLoan Portfolio and Credit Quality\nAdditional information regarding the effects and potential effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's business, operating results and financial condition is described in this Management Discussion and Analysis. See also Part I. Item 1. \"Business - Supervision and Regulation\" and Part I. Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" for further details.\nThe following table summarizes the average balances and interest rates paid on the Bank's deposits:\n\n\u2022The Company recorded a Provision for loan losses of $32.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a credit of $3.6 million in 2019. The 2020 Provision for loan losses was primarily driven by the change in Allowance for loan losses methodology from the incurred loss model to the current expected credit loss model, the current reasonable and supportable economic forecast deterioration as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the net change in qualitative factors to account for risks and assumptions related to our loan portfolio not incorporated in the forecasts.\nOther assets. Other assets consisting of Premises and equipment, net; Fees receivable; Accrued interest receivable; Deferred income taxes, net; Right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets; and Other assets, increased $63.4

"summary": " Here are the key points from the MD&A report:\n\n- Net income attributable to the Company for 2020 was $45.2 million, compared to $80.0 million in 2019 and $80.4 million in 2018. Earnings per share was $0.55 in 2020 versus $0.97 in 2019 and $0.92 in 2018.\n\n- Total revenue was $327.8 million in 2020, down from $346.6 million in 2019 and $384.6 million in 2018. The decrease was driven by lower net interest income and fees/other income.\n\n- Net interest income increased 2% to $233.4 million in 2020 due to lower funding costs and income from PPP loans, offset somewhat by lower interest rates. \n\n- Provision for loan losses was $32.0 million in 2020 compared to credits of $3.6 million in 2019 and $2.2 million in 2018. The increase reflects the new CECL methodology, deterioration in economic forecasts due to COVID-19, and changes in qualitative factors.\n\n- Total loans increased 2% to $7.1 billion while total deposits grew 19% to $8.6 billion in 2020. The growth was driven by increased liquidity from clients.\n\n- Operating expenses increased 5% to $241.3 million in 2020, primarily due to higher technology costs, salaries/benefits, and loan loss reserves. This was offset partly by lower restructuring and professional services expenses.\n\n- The allowance for loan losses was $81.2 million or 1.14% of total loans at December 31, 2020 compared to $72.0 million or 1.03% at December 31, 2019.\n\nIn summary, lower revenue and higher loan loss provisions along with increased operating expenses led to a 44% decrease in net income in 2020 versus 2019. Loan and deposit growth was strong during the year."}
