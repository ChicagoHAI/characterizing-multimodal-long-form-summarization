Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled Risk Factors,\u201d Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Business\u201d and our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCompany Overview\nRexford Industrial Realty, Inc. is a self-administered and self-managed full-service REIT focused on owning and operating industrial properties in Southern California infill markets. We were formed as a Maryland corporation on January 18,\n2013 and Rexford Industrial Realty, L.P. (the Operating Partnership\u201d), of which we are the sole general partner, was formed as a Maryland limited partnership on January 18, 2013. Through our controlling interest in our Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, we own, manage, lease, acquire and develop industrial real estate primarily located in Southern California infill markets, and from time to time, acquire or provide mortgage debt secured by industrial property. We are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a REIT under the Code, and generally are not subject to federal taxes on our income to the extent we distribute our income to our shareholders and maintain our qualification as a REIT.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our consolidated portfolio consisted of 213 properties with approximately 26.6 million rentable square feet. In addition, we currently manage an additional 19 properties with approximately 1.0 million rentable square feet.\nOur goal is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders by providing superior access to industrial property investments and mortgage debt secured by industrial property in high barrier Southern California infill markets. Our target markets provide us with opportunities to acquire both stabilized properties generating favorable cash flow, as well as properties or land parcels where we can enhance returns through value-add renovations and redevelopment or the development of new industrial buildings. Scarcity of available space and high barriers limiting new construction of for-lease product all contribute to create superior long-term supply/demand fundamentals within our target infill Southern California industrial property markets. With our vertically integrated operating platform and extensive value-add investment and management capabilities, we believe we are positioned to capitalize upon the opportunities in our markets to achieve our objectives.\nHighlights\nAcquisitions\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>During 2019, we acquired 40 properties, with a combined 5.4 million rentable square feet, for an aggregate cost of $970.7 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Repositioning\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>During 2019 we completed the lease-up and stabilized five of our repositioning properties located at 1998 Surveyor Avenue, 14748-14750 Nelson Avenue, 15401 Figueroa Street, 1332-1340 Rocky Point and 1580 Carson Street with a combined 0.4 million square feet, as well as 109,129 rentable square feet of space at 3233 Mission Oaks Boulevard.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2019, we have leased 42,504 rentable square feet at 2455 Conejo Spectrum Street, 51,925 rentable square feet at 16121 Carmenita Road and our 72,250 rentable square foot building located at 635 8th Street, of which 47,048 rentable square feet is pre-leased with lease commencement expected to occur in March 2020.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Dispositions\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>During 2019, we sold three properties and one industrial condominium unit with a combined 0.2 million rentable square feet, for a total gross sales price of $33.6 million, and total net cash proceeds of $32.3 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Equity\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>During 2019, we sold 16,817,930 shares of common stock under our various at-the-market equity offering programs, for gross proceeds of $649.3 million, or approximately $38.61 per share, and net proceeds of $639.6 million after deducting the sales agents' fee.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In April 2019, in connection with the acquisition of the property located at 1515 East 15th Street, we issued to the seller 593,960 newly issued 4.43937% Cumulative Redeemable Convertible Preferred Units of partnership interest in the Operating Partnership ( Series 1 CPOP Units\u201d) valued at $27.4 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In September 2019, we completed a public offering of 3,450,000 shares of our 5.625% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at a price of $25.00 per share, for net proceeds of approximately $83.2 million after deducting the underwriters' discount and offering costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Financing\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In July 2019, we completed a private placement of $100.0 million of senior notes comprised of $25.0 million of 10-year senior notes at a fixed rate of 3.88% and $75.0 million of 15-year senior notes at a fixed rate of 4.03%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In February 2020, we amended our senior unsecured credit facility to, among other changes, increase the aggregate commitment for our unsecured revolving credit facility to $500 million from $350 million and to extend the maturity date of the unsecured revolving credit facility to February 2024 from February 2021.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFactors That May Influence Future Results of Operations\nMarket Fundamentals\nOur operating results depend upon the infill Southern California industrial real estate market.\nThe infill Southern California industrial real estate sector has continued to exhibit strong fundamentals. These high-barrier infill markets are characterized by a relative scarcity of available product, generally operating at near full occupancy, coupled with limited ability to introduce new supply due to high land and development costs and a dearth of developable land in markets experiencing a net reduction in supply as more industrial property is converted to non-industrial uses than can be delivered. Consequently, available industrial supply continues to decrease in many of our target infill submarkets, landlord concessions are at cyclically low levels and construction deliveries are falling short of demand. Meanwhile, underlying tenant demand within our infill target markets continues to demonstrate growth, illustrated or driven by strong re-leasing spreads, strong renewal activity, an expanding regional economy, substantial growth in e-commerce transaction and delivery volumes, as well as further compression of delivery time-frames to consumers and to businesses, increasing the significance of last-mile facilities for timely fulfillment. Despite potential concerns related to global growth, tax reform and changes to trade and tariff policies, we continue to observe a number of positive trends within our target infill markets. Based on current observations within the infill Southern California industrial property market and within our property portfolio, we expect these positive trends may continue into the upcoming year.\nIn Los Angeles County, positive market trends continued through 2019, as high tenant demand kept vacancy at historically low levels and average asking lease rates increased significantly during 2019. Current market conditions indicate rents are likely to continue their upward trend with potential increases through 2020, as occupancy still remains at near capacity levels and new development is limited by a lack of land availability and an increase in land and development costs.\nIn Orange County, market fundamentals remained favorable throughout 2019. With steady tenant demand and a continued low availability of industrial product in this region, average asking lease rates continued their upward trend during 2019 and vacancy remained at historically low levels. Current regional market conditions indicate the potential for continued rental growth through 2020.\nIn San Diego, although there was an increase in vacancy year-over-year, net absorption was positive during 2019 and average asking lease rates increased year-over-year.\nIn Ventura County, there was a slight increase in vacancy year-over-year and a slight increase in asking lease rates year-over year.\nLastly, in the Inland Empire, new industrial product continues to be absorbed well in the market. In the Inland Empire West, which contains infill markets in which we operate, vacancy remained at historically low levels and asking lease rates increased year-over-year. We expect the outlook for the Inland Empire West to remain positive over the upcoming year. We generally do not focus on properties located within the non-infill Inland Empire East sub-market where available land and the development and construction pipeline for new supply is substantial.\nAcquisitions and Value-Add Repositioning and Development of Properties\nThe Company's growth strategy comprises acquiring leased, stabilized properties as well as properties with value-add opportunities to improve functionality and to deploy our value-driven asset management programs in order to increase cash flow and value. Additionally, from time to time, we may acquire land parcels or properties with excess land where we may construct new buildings. Acquisitions may comprise single property investments as well as the purchase of portfolios of properties, with transaction values typically ranging from a $10 million minimum property investment to portfolios potentially valued in the billions of dollars. The Company's geographic focus remains infill Southern California. However, from time-to-time, portfolios could be acquired comprising a critical mass of infill Southern California industrial property that could include some assets located in markets outside of infill Southern California. In general, to the extent non-infill-Southern California assets were to be acquired as part of a larger portfolio, the Company may underwrite such investments with the potential to dispose such assets over a certain period of time in order to maximize its core focus on infill Southern California, while endeavoring to take appropriate steps to satisfy REIT safe harbor requirements to avoid prohibited transactions under REIT tax laws.\nA key component of our growth strategy is to acquire properties through off-market and lightly marketed transactions that are often operating at below-market occupancy or below-market rent at the time of acquisition or that have near-term lease roll-over or that provide opportunities to add value through functional or physical repositioning and improvements. Through various redevelopment, repositioning, and professional leasing and marketing strategies, we seek to increase the properties' functionality and attractiveness to prospective tenants and, over time, to stabilize the properties at occupancy rates that meet or exceed market rates.\nA repositioning can consist of a range of improvements to a property. This may include a complete structural renovation of a property whereby we convert large underutilized spaces into a series of smaller and more functional spaces, or it may include the creation of additional square footage, the modernization of the building and property site, the elimination of functional obsolescence, the addition or enhancement of loading areas and truck access, the enhancement of fire-life-safety systems or other accretive improvements. Because each repositioning effort is unique and determined based on the property, targeted tenants and overall trends in the general market and specific submarket, the timing and effect of the repositioning on our rental revenue and occupancy levels will vary, and, as a result, will affect the comparison of our results of operations from period to period with limited predictability.\nAs of December 31, 2019, eight of our properties were in various stages of repositioning or development and three of our properties were in the lease-up stage. In addition, we anticipate beginning repositioning/redevelopment work on three additional properties in the near future. The table below sets forth a summary of these properties, as well as the seven projects that were stabilized during 2019 and the four properties that were stabilized during 2018, as the timing of these stabilizations have a direct impact on our current and comparative results of operations. In addition to the properties in the table below, we also have a range of smaller spaces in value-add repositioning or renovation, that due to their smaller size and relatively nominal amount of down-time, are not presented below, however, in the aggregate, may be substantial.\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated Construction Period(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property (Submarket)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Market\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Same Properties Portfolio(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Property Rentable Square Feet\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Vacant Rentable Square Feet Under Repositioning\n/Lease-up\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated New Development Rentable Square Feet\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Start\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Completion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Property Leased % at 12/31/19\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current Repositioning:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>28901-28903 Avenue Paine -

An increase in our repositioning and development activities resulting from value-add acquisitions could cause an increase in the asset balances qualifying for interest, insurance and tax capitalization in future periods. We capitalized $3.9 million of interest expense and $1.3\nmillion of insurance and real estate tax expense during the year ended December 31, 2019, related to our repositioning and redevelopment projects.\nRental Revenue\nOur operating results depend primarily upon generating rental revenue from the properties in our consolidated portfolio. The amount of rental revenue generated by these properties is affected by our ability to maintain or increase occupancy levels and rental rates at our properties, which will depend upon our ability to lease vacant space and re-lease expiring space at favorable rates.\nOccupancy Rates\nAs of December 31, 2019, our consolidated portfolio, inclusive of space in repositioning as described in the subsequent paragraph, was approximately 96.1% occupied, while our stabilized consolidated portfolio exclusive of such space was approximately 97.9% occupied. We believe the opportunity to increase occupancy at our properties will be an important driver of future revenue growth. An opportunity to drive this growth will derive from the lease-up of recently completed repositioning projects and the completion and lease-up of repositioning and development projects that are currently under construction and planned for near-term construction.\nAs summarized in the table under Acquisitions and Value-Add Repositioning and Development of Properties\u201d above, as of December 31, 2019, eight of our properties that will have a combined 1.1 million rentable square feet at completion are in current repositioning or development, and three properties with 0.2 million rentable square feet are in lease-up. Vacant repositioning space and lease-up space at these 11 properties are concentrated in our Los Angeles, Orange County, Ventura and San Diego markets, and represent 1.9% of our total consolidated portfolio square footage as of December 31, 2019. Including vacant repositioning and lease-up space at these 11 properties, our weighted average occupancy rate as of December 31, 2019, in Los Angeles, Orange County, Ventura and San Diego was 96.9%, 96.3%, 94.6% and 91.4%, respectively. Excluding vacant repositioning and lease-up space at these 11 properties, our weighted average occupancy rate as of December 31, 2019, in these markets was 98.8%, 96.9%, 98.9% and 94.8%, respectively. We believe that an important portion of our long-term future growth will come from the completion of these projects currently under or scheduled for repositioning, as well as through the identification or acquisition of new opportunities for redevelopment and repositioning, whether in our existing portfolio or through new investments, which may vary from period to period subject to market conditions.\nThe occupancy rate of properties not undergoing repositioning is affected by regional and local economic conditions in our Southern California infill markets. Throughout 2019, the Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego county markets continued to show historically low vacancy and positive absorption, resulting from high tenant demand combined with low product availability. Accordingly, our properties in these markets have exhibited a similar trend. We expect general market conditions to remain positive in 2020, and we believe the opportunity to increase occupancy and rental rates at our properties will be an important driver of future revenue growth.\nLeasing Activity and Rental Rates\nThe following tables set forth our leasing activity for new and renewal leases on a quarterly basis for the year ended December 31, 2019:\nTable 194:

While we reposition a property, its space may become unavailable for leasing until completion of our repositioning efforts. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we stabilized 14748-14750 Nelson Avenue, 1998 Surveyor Avenue, 15401 Figueroa Street, 1332-1340 Rocky Point Drive, 1580 Carson Street and 3233 Mission Oaks Boulevard - Unit 3233 with a combined 524,050 rentable square feet. As of December 31, 2019, we have six current repositioning projects and two development projects with estimated construction completion periods ranging from the first quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021. Additionally, we have three properties in the lease-up stage. We expect these properties to have positive impacts on our leasing activity and revenue generation as we complete our value-add repositioning plans and place these properties in service.\nScheduled Lease Expirations\nOur ability to re-lease space subject to expiring leases is affected by economic and competitive conditions in our markets and by the desirability of our individual properties, which may impact our results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, 0.7 million rentable square feet of our portfolio was available for lease, 0.3 million rentable square feet of vacant space was under repositioning and leases representing 0.1 million rentable square feet of our portfolio expired on December 31, 2019. Additionally, leases representing 14.7% and 19.8% of the aggregate rentable square footage of our portfolio are scheduled to expire during the years ending December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we renewed 225 leases for 3.3 million rentable square feet, resulting in a 72.8% retention rate. Our retention rate during the period was impacted by the combination of low vacancy and high demand in many of our key markets. New and renewal leases signed during the current year had a weighted average term of 5.2 and 4.6 years, respectively, and we expect future new and renewal leases to have similar terms.\nThe leases scheduled to expire during the years ending December 31, 2020 and 2021, represent 14.9% and 19.4%, respectively, of the total annualized base rent for our portfolio as of December 31, 2019. We estimate that, on a weighted average basis, in-place rents of leases scheduled to expire in 2020 and 2021 are currently below current market asking rates, although individual units or properties within any particular submarket may currently be leased either above, below, or at the current market asking rates within that submarket. As described in the above Market Fundamentals section, we expect market dynamics to remain strong heading into 2020 and that these positive trends will provide a favorable environment for additional increases in lease renewal rates. Accordingly, we expect 2020 will show positive renewal rates and leasing spreads. We also currently do not see any reason not to expect that 2021 lease expirations will show positive growth upon renewal; however, it is difficult to predict market conditions that far into the future.\nConditions in Our Markets\nThe properties in our portfolio are located primarily in Southern California infill markets. Positive or negative changes in economic or other conditions, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters in this market may affect our overall performance.\nProperty Expenses\nOur property expenses generally consist of utilities, real estate taxes, insurance, site repair and maintenance costs, and the allocation of overhead costs. For the majority of our properties, our property expenses are recovered, in part, by either the triple net provisions or modified gross expense reimbursements in tenant leases. The majority of our leases also comprise contractual three percent annual rental rate increases meant, in part, to help mitigate potential increases in property expenses over time. However, the terms of our leases vary and, in some instances, we may absorb property expenses. Our overall financial results will be impacted by the extent to which we are able to pass-through property expenses to our tenants.\nTaxable REIT Subsidiary\nAs of December 31, 2019, our Operating Partnership indirectly and wholly owns Rexford Industrial Realty and Management, Inc., which we refer to as the services company. We have elected, together with our services company, to treat our services company as a taxable REIT subsidiary for federal income tax purposes. A taxable REIT subsidiary generally may provide non-customary and other services to our tenants and engage in activities that we may not engage in directly without adversely affecting our qualification as a REIT, provided a taxable REIT subsidiary may not operate or manage a lodging facility or health care facility or provide rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility or health care facility is operated. We may form additional taxable REIT subsidiaries in the future, and our Operating Partnership may contribute some or all of its interests in certain wholly owned subsidiaries or their assets to our services company. Any income earned by our taxable REIT subsidiaries will not be included in our taxable income for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests, except to the extent such income is distributed to us as a dividend, in which case such dividend income will qualify under the 95%, but not the 75%, gross income test. Because a taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to federal income tax, and state and local income tax (where applicable) as a regular corporation, the income earned by our taxable REIT subsidiaries generally will be subject to an additional level of tax as compared to the income earned by our other subsidiaries. Our taxable REIT subsidiary is a C-corporation subject to federal and state income tax. However it has a cumulative unrecognized net operation loss carryforward and therefore there is no income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for the reporting periods. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates and assumptions. We have summarized below those accounting policies that require material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on financial condition and results of operations. Management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis, based upon information currently available and on various assumptions that it believes are reasonable as of the date hereof. In addition, other companies in similar businesses may use different estimation policies and methodologies, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations and financial condition to those of other companies.\nA critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity's financial condition and results of operations and requires judgment on the part of management. Generally, the judgment requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates are prepared using management's best judgment, after considering past and current economic conditions and expectations for the future. Changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by the users of our financial statements in their evaluation of our performance.\nThe following critical accounting policies discussion reflects what we believe are the most significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. For further discussion of our significant accounting policies and discussion of new accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 of this report on Form 10-K.\nInvestment in Real Estate\nAcquisitions\nWe account for acquisitions of properties under Accounting Standards Update 2017-01, Business Combinations - Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which provides a framework for determining whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or businesses and further revises the definition of a business.\nWe evaluated the acquisitions that we completed during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, and determined that under this framework these transactions should be accounted for as asset acquisitions. Our acquisitions of properties generally no longer meet the revised definition of a business and accordingly are accounted for as asset acquisitions.\nFor asset acquisitions, we allocate the cost of the acquisition, which includes the purchase price and associated acquisition transaction costs, to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis. These individual assets and liabilities typically include land, building and improvements, tenant improvements, intangible assets and liabilities related to above- and below-market leases, intangible assets related to in-place leases, and from time to time, assumed debt. As there is no measurement period concept for an asset acquisition, the allocated cost of the acquired assets is finalized in the period in which the acquisition occurs.\nWe determine the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property by valuing the property as if it were vacant. This as-if vacant\u201d value is estimated using an income, or discounted cash flow, approach that relies upon Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable inputs based on the Company's assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use. These Level 3 inputs include discount rates, capitalization rates, market rents and comparable sales data for similar properties. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. In calculating the as-if-vacant\u201d value for acquisitions completed during the year ended December 31, 2019, we used discount rates ranging from 5.75% and 7.75% and capitalization rates ranging from 4.50% to 7.25%.\nIn determining the fair value of intangible lease assets or liabilities, we also consider Level 3 inputs. Acquired above- and below-market leases are valued based on the present value of the difference between prevailing market rates and the in-place rates measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases, if applicable. The estimated fair value of acquired in-place at-market tenant leases are the costs that would have been incurred to lease the property to the occupancy level of the property at the date of acquisition. Such estimates include the value associated with leasing commissions, legal and other costs, as well as the estimated period necessary to lease such property to its occupancy level at the time of its acquisition. In determining the fair value of acquisitions completed during the year ended December 31, 2019, we used an estimated average lease-up period ranging from six to twelve months.\nThe difference between the fair value and the face value of debt assumed in connection with an acquisition is recorded as a premium or discount and amortized to interest expense\u201d over the life of the debt assumed. The valuation of assumed liabilities is based on our estimate of the current market rates for similar liabilities in effect at the acquisition date.\nCapitalization of Costs\nWe capitalize direct costs incurred in developing, renovating, rehabilitating and improving real estate assets as part of the investment basis. This includes certain general and administrative costs, including payroll, bonus, and non-cash equity compensation of the personnel performing development, renovations and rehabilitation if such costs are identifiable to a specific activity to get the real estate asset ready for its intended use. During the development and construction periods of a project, we also capitalize interest, real estate taxes and insurance costs. We cease capitalization of costs upon substantial completion of the project, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. If some portions of a project are substantially complete and ready for use and other portions have not yet reached that stage, we cease capitalizing costs on the completed portion of the project but continue to capitalize for the incomplete portion of the project. Costs incurred in making repairs and maintaining real estate assets are expensed as incurred.\nWe capitalized interest costs of $3.9 million, $2.1 million and $1.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We capitalized real estate taxes and insurance aggregating $1.3 million, $0.9 million and $1.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We capitalized compensation costs for employees who provide construction services of $2.7 million, $2.2 million and $1.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nIn accordance with the provisions of the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets Subsections of ASC Topic 360: Property, Plant, and Equipment, we assess the carrying values of our respective long-lived assets, including goodwill, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable.\nRecoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. To review real estate assets for recoverability, we consider current market conditions as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. The intent with regard to the underlying assets might change as market conditions and other factors change. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, applying a capitalization rate to estimated net operating income of a property, quoted market values and third party appraisals, where considered necessary. The use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan used to manage our underlying business. If our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we will recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the real estate property.\nAssumptions and estimates used in the recoverability analyses for future cash flows, discount rates and capitalization rates are complex and subjective. Changes in economic and operating conditions or our intent with respect to our investment that occur subsequent to our impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment of our real estate properties.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur primary sources of revenue are rental income, management, leasing and development services and gains on sale of real estate.\nRental Income\nMinimum annual lease payments are recognized in rental income on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease, regardless of when payments are contractually due. Rental revenue recognition commences when the tenant takes possession or controls the physical use of the leased space. Lease termination fees, which are included in rental income, are recognized when the related leases are canceled and we have no continuing obligation to provide services to such former tenants.\nOur lease agreements with tenants generally contain provisions that require tenants to reimburse us for certain property expenses. Estimated reimbursements from tenants for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and other recoverable operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period that the expenses are incurred. Subsequent to year-end, we perform final reconciliations on a lease-by-lease basis and bill or credit each tenant for any cumulative annual adjustments.\nManagement, leasing and development services\nWe provide property management services and leasing services to related party and third-party property owners (the customer\u201d) in exchange for fees and commissions.\nProperty management services include performing property inspections, monitoring repairs and maintenance, negotiating vendor contracts, maintaining tenant relations and providing financial and accounting oversight. For these services, we earn monthly management fees, which are based on a fixed percentage of each managed property's monthly tenant cash receipts. We have determined that control over the services is passed to the customer simultaneously as performance occurs. Accordingly, management fee revenue is earned as services are provided to the customer.\nLeasing commissions are earned when we provide leasing services to the customer that result in an executed lease with a tenant. We have determined that control over the services is transferred to the customer upon execution of each lease agreement. We earn leasing commissions based on a fixed percentage of rental income generated for each executed lease agreement and there is no variable income component.\nGain or Loss on Sale of Real Estate\nWe account for dispositions of real estate properties, which are considered nonfinancial assets, in accordance with ASC 610-20: Other Income-Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets and recognize a gain or loss on sale of real estate upon transferring control of the nonfinancial asset to the purchaser, which is generally satisfied at the time of sale. If we were to conduct a partial sale of real estate by transferring a controlling interest in a nonfinancial asset, while retaining a noncontrolling ownership interest, we would measure any noncontrolling interest received or retained at fair value, and recognize a full gain or loss. If we receive consideration before transferring control of a nonfinancial asset, we recognize a contract liability. If we transfer control of the asset before consideration is received, we recognize a contract asset.\nValuation of Receivables\nWe may be subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that could affect the collection of outstanding receivables related to our operating leases. In order to mitigate these risks, we perform credit reviews and analyses on prospective tenants before significant leases are executed and on existing tenants before properties are acquired. On a quarterly basis, we perform an assessment of the collectability of operating lease receivables on a tenant-by-tenant basis, which includes reviewing the age and nature of our receivables, the payment history and financial condition of the tenant, our assessment of the tenant's ability to meet its lease obligations and the status of negotiations of any disputes with the tenant. Any changes in the collectability assessment for an operating lease is recognized as an adjustment, which can be a reduction or increase, to rental income in the consolidated statements of operations. As a result of our quarterly collectability assessments, we recognized $0.7 million and $1.2 million, $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively, as a reduction of rental income in the consolidated statements of operations.\nResults of Operations\nOur consolidated results of operations are often not comparable from period to period due to the effect of property acquisitions and dispositions completed during the comparative reporting periods. Our Total Portfolio\u201d represents all of the properties owned during the reported periods. To eliminate the effect of changes in our Total Portfolio due to acquisitions and dispositions and to highlight the operating results of our on-going business, we have separately presented the results of our Same Properties Portfolio.\u201d\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2019 to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nFor the comparison of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our Same Properties Portfolio includes all properties in our industrial portfolio that were wholly-owned by us as of January 1, 2018, and still owned by us as of December 31, 2019, which consisted of 144 properties aggregating approximately 18.1 million rentable square feet. Results for our Same Properties Portfolio exclude any properties that were acquired or sold during 2019 and 2018, interest income, interest expense and corporate general and administrative expenses. For the comparison of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our Total Portfolio includes the properties in our Same Properties Portfolio, the 70 properties aggregating approximately 8.4 million rentable square feet that were acquired during 2019 and 2018, and the nine properties aggregating approximately 0.5 million rentable square feet that were sold during 2019 and 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our Same Properties Portfolio occupancy was approximately 97.4% and 96.0%, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our Same Properties Portfolio weighted average occupancy was approximately 96.8% and 95.6%, respectively. These occupancy changes were partially driven by the completion of repositioning and development work and subsequent lease-up of space at the following six properties in our Same Properties Portfolio during the period from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019: (i) 14748-14750 Nelson Avenue, (ii) 3233 Mission Oaks Boulevard,\n(iii) 301-445 Figueroa Street, (iv) 28903 Avenue Paine, (v) 15401 Figueroa Street and (vi) 1601 Alton Parkway (collectively, the SPP Stabilized Properties\u201d).\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

</tr>\n</table>\nRental Income\nOn January 1, 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases ( ASC 842\u201d) using the modified retrospective approach and elected the non-separation practical expedient\u201d in ASC 842 that alleviates the requirement to separately present lease and non-lease components of lease contracts if certain criteria are met. As a result, we account for and present all rental income earned pursuant to tenant leases, including tenant reimbursements, as a single component in one line, Rental income,\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations. Prior to the adoption ASC 842, we presented rental revenue, tenant reimbursements and other income related to leases separately in our consolidated statements of operations. However, to facilitate comparability, we have reclassified 2018 amounts to conform with 2019 presentation. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 of this Report on Form 10-K for disclosure related to the adoption of ASC 842.\nThe following table reports the breakdown of 2019 rental income, as reported prior to the adoption of ASC 842, and compares this breakdown with 2018 amounts for the comparable period (dollars in thousands). We believe that the below presentation of rental income is not, and is not intended to be, a presentation in accordance with GAAP. We are presenting this information because we believe it is frequently used by management, investors, securities analysts and other interested parties to evaluate the Company's performance.\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Same Properties Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Portfolio\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase/(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase/(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Category\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental revenue(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>171,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>222,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>177,568\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant reimbursements (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>203,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>192,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>264,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>210,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur Same Properties Portfolio and Total Portfolio rental income increased by $10.9 million, or 5.7%, and $53.6 million, or 25.5%, respectively, during the year ended months ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended months ended December 31, 2018, for the reasons described below:\n(1) Rental Revenue\nOur Same Properties Portfolio and Total Portfolio rental revenue increased by $9.7 million, or 6.0%, and $44.9 million, or 25.3%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in our Same Properties Portfolio rental revenue is primarily due to the increase in the weighted average occupancy of the portfolio for comparable periods, which was partially driven by the lease-up of the six SPP Stabilized Properties, and the increase in average rental rates on new and renewal leases. Our Total Portfolio rental income was also positively impacted by the incremental revenues from the 70 properties we acquired during 2018 and 2019, partially offset by the decrease in revenues from the nine properties that were sold during 2018 and 2019.\n(2) Tenant Reimbursements\nOur Same Properties Portfolio and Total Portfolio tenant reimbursements revenue increased by $0.8 million, or 2.9%, and $8.2 million or 25.5%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in our Same Properties Portfolio tenant reimbursements is primarily due to an increase in the weighted average occupancy for comparable periods, which was partially driven by the lease-up of the six SPP Stabilized Properties, and an increase in reimbursable property expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in tenant reimbursements revenue due to the adoption of ASC 842 and the related change in reporting for real estate taxes that are paid directly by a lessee to a third party, from a gross basis to a net basis, at three of our properties. Our Total Portfolio tenant reimbursements revenue was also impacted by the incremental reimbursements from the 70 properties we acquired during 2018 and 2019, partially offset by the decrease in reimbursements from the nine properties that were sold during 2018 and 2019.\n(3) Other Income\nOur Same Properties Portfolio and Total Portfolio other income increased by $0.4 million, or 45.9%, and $0.5 million, or 58.8%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase in miscellaneous income.\nManagement, Leasing and Development Services\nOur Total Portfolio management, leasing and development services revenue decreased by $0.1 million, or 14.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nInterest Income\nOur Total Portfolio interest income increased by $1.2 million, or 85.4%, during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase in the average cash balance invested in money market accounts.\nProperty Expenses\nOur Same Properties Portfolio and Total Portfolio property expenses increased by $1.8 million, or 3.9%, and $11.6 million, or 22.5%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in our Same Properties Portfolio property expenses is primarily due to an increase in real estate tax expense relating to\nCalifornia Proposition 13 annual increases and property reassessments, lower capitalized real estate tax expense due to completed repositioning activity, as well as increases in allocated overhead costs and insurance expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in real estate tax expense due to the adoption of ASC 842 and the change in reporting for real estate taxes that are paid directly by a lessee to a third party from a gross basis to a net basis at three of our properties. Our Total Portfolio property expenses were also impacted by incremental expenses from the 70 properties we acquired during 2018 and 2019, partially offset by the decrease in property expenses from the nine properties that were sold during 2018 and 2019.\nGeneral and Administrative\nOur Total Portfolio general and administrative expenses increased by $5.1 million, or 20.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase is primarily due to increases in payroll related expenses due to a higher headcount, non-cash equity compensation expense, accrued bonus expense and other various corporate expenses, partially offset by a decrease in legal expense.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nOur Same Properties Portfolio depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $0.5 million, or 0.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to acquisition-related tenant improvements and in-place lease intangibles becoming fully depreciated during 2018 and 2019, partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense related to capital improvements placed into service during 2018 and 2019. Our Total Portfolio depreciation and amortization expense increased by $18.8 million, or 23.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to incremental expense from the 70 properties we acquired during 2018 and 2019, and an increase in depreciation expense related to capital improvements, partially offset by the decrease in our Same Properties Portfolio depreciation and amortization expense noted above.\nAcquisition Expenses\nOur Total Portfolio acquisition expenses decreased by $0.1 million, or 46.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nInterest Expense\nOur Total Portfolio interest expense increased by $1.5 million, or 5.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in interest expense is primarily comprised of the following: (i) a $2.3 million increase related to the $150.0 million term loan facility borrowing that we completed in May 2018, (ii) a $1.8 million increase related to the private placement of $100.0 million of senior notes that we completed in July 2019 and (iii) a $0.5 million increase related to the $150 million swap that became effective in July 2019. These increases were partially offset by (i) a $1.8 million increase in capitalized interest related to our repositioning and redevelopment properties and (ii) a $1.1 million decrease in interest related to lower average outstanding borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nGain on Sale of Real Estate\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized a total gain on sale of real estate of $16.3 million from the disposition of three properties and one industrial condominium unit that were sold for an aggregate gross sales price of $33.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized a total gain on sale of real estate of $17.2 million from the disposition of six properties that were sold for an aggregate gross sales price of $48.0 million.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2018 to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nRefer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations\u201d in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on February 19, 2019, for a discussion of the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNon-GAAP Supplemental Measure: Funds From Operations\nWe calculate funds from operations ( FFO\u201d) attributable to common stockholders in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d). FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, impairment\nlosses, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures.\nManagement uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions, and asset impairments, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of performance used by other REITs, FFO may be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs.\nHowever, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. Other equity REITs may not calculate or interpret FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as we do, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity and is not indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to FFO (in thousands):\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>98,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deduct:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of real estate\n</td> <td>(16,297\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17,222\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29,573\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on acquisition of unconsolidated joint venture property (1)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds from operations (FFO)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>146,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: preferred stock dividends\n</td> <td>(11,055\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,694\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,875\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: FFO attributable to noncontrolling interest (2)\n</td> <td>(3,897\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,295\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,914\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: FFO attributable to participating securities (3)\n</td> <td>(733\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(642\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(546\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Amount relates to the Company's acquisition of the remaining 85% ownership interest in the property located at 3233 Mission Oaks Boulevard from a prior unconsolidated joint venture.

NOI is calculated as rental income less property expenses (before interest expense, depreciation and amortization).\nWe use NOI as a supplemental performance measure because, in excluding real estate depreciation and amortization expense, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, gains (or losses) on sale of real estate and other non-operating items, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that NOI will be useful to investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because NOI excludes depreciation and amortization expense and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties (all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our results from operations), the utility of NOI as a measure of our performance is limited. Other equity REITs may not calculate NOI in a similar manner and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to such other REITs' NOI. Accordingly, NOI should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of our performance. NOI should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. NOI should not be used as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities in accordance with GAAP.\nNOI on a cash-basis ( Cash NOI\u201d) is a non-GAAP measure, which we calculate by adding or subtracting the following items from NOI: i) fair value lease revenue and ii) straight-line rental revenue adjustments. We use Cash NOI, together with NOI, as a supplemental performance measure. Cash NOI should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. Cash NOI should not be used as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table sets forth the revenue and expense items comprising NOI and the adjustments to calculate Cash NOI (in thousands):\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

</tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Supplemental Measure: EBITDAre\nWe calculate earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization for real estate ( EBITDAre\u201d) in accordance with the standards established by NAREIT. EBITDAre is calculated as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, impairment losses and adjustments to reflect our proportionate share of EBITDAre from our prior unconsolidated joint venture.\nWe believe that EBITDAre is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of our operating performance as a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of our properties. We also use this measure in ratios to compare our performance to that of our industry peers. In addition, we believe EBITDAre is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of equity REITs. However, our industry peers may not calculate EBITDAre in accordance with the NAREIT definition as we do and, accordingly, our EBITDAre may not be comparable to our peers' EBITDAre. Accordingly, EBITDAre should be considered only as a supplement to net income (loss) as a measure of our performance.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to EBITDAre (in thousands):\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>26,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>98,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of real estate\n</td> <td>(16,297\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17,222\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29,573\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on acquisition of unconsolidated joint venture property (1)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDAre\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>173,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>135,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Amount relates to the Company's acquisition of the remaining 85% ownership interest in the property located at 3233 Mission Oaks Boulevard from a prior unconsolidated joint venture.

We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through available cash on hand, cash flow from operations, by drawing on our unsecured revolving credit facility and by issuing shares of common stock pursuant to the at-the-market equity offering program described below.\nOur long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for acquisitions, recurring and non-recurring capital expenditures and scheduled debt maturities. We intend to satisfy our long-term liquidity needs through net cash flow from operations, proceeds from long-term secured and unsecured financings, borrowings available under our unsecured revolving credit facility, the issuance of equity securities, including preferred stock, and proceeds from selective real estate dispositions as we identify capital recycling opportunities.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our cash and cash equivalents were $78.9 million, and we did not have any borrowings outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility, leaving $350.0 million available for future borrowings.\nSources of Liquidity\nCash Flow from Operations\nCash flow from operations is one of our key sources of liquidity and is primarily dependent upon: (i) the occupancy levels and lease rates at our properties, (ii) our ability to collect rent, (iii) the level of operating costs we incur and (iv) our ability to pass through operating expenses to our tenants. We are subject to a number of risks related to general economic and other unpredictable conditions, which have the potential to affect our overall performance and resulting cash flows from operations. However, based on our current portfolio mix and business strategy, we anticipate that we will be able to generate positive cash flows from operations.\nATM Program\nOn June 13, 2019, we established a new at-the-market equity offering program (the $550 Million ATM Program\u201d) pursuant to which we may sell from time to time up to an aggregate of $550.0 million of our common stock through sales agents. The $550 Million ATM Program replaces our previous $450.0 million at-the-market equity offering program which was established on February 19, 2019 (the Prior ATM Program\u201d). Substantially all $450.0 million of shares of our common stock available under the Prior ATM Program were sold prior to establishing the $550 Million ATM Program.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold a total of 16,817,930 shares of our common stock under the $550 Million ATM Program and the Prior ATM Program at a weighted average price of $38.61 per share, for gross proceeds of $649.3 million, and net proceeds of $639.6 million, after deducting the sales agents' fee. As of December 31, 2019, we had the capacity to issue up to an additional $350.7 million of common stock under the $550 Million ATM Program.\nFuture sales, if any, will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including among others, market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and capital needs. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering of shares under the $550 Million ATM Program, if any, to fund potential acquisition opportunities, repay amounts outstanding from time to time under our unsecured revolving credit facility or other debt financing obligations, to fund our development or redevelopment activities and/or for general corporate purposes.\nEquity Offerings\nOn September 20, 2019, we completed an underwritten public offering of 3,450,000 shares of our 5.625% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the Series C Preferred Stock\u201d), including 450,000 additional shares of Series C Preferred Stock pursuant to an option to purchase additional shares solely to cover over-allotments, at a price of $25.00 per share. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $83.2 million after deducting the underwriters' discount and offering costs totaling $3.0 million. We used the net proceeds from the offering to fund various acquisitions and for general corporate purposes.\nWe evaluate the capital markets on an ongoing basis for opportunities to raise capital, and as circumstances warrant, we may issue additional securities, from time to time, to fund acquisitions, for the repayment of long-term debt upon maturity and for other general corporate purposes. Any future issuance, however, is dependent upon market conditions, available pricing and capital needs and there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such offerings of securities.\nCapital Recycling\nWe continuously evaluate opportunities for the potential disposition of properties in our portfolio when we believe such disposition is appropriate in view of our business objectives. In evaluating these opportunities, we consider a variety of criteria including, but not limited to, local market conditions and lease rates, asset type and location, as well as potential uses of proceeds and tax considerations. Tax considerations include entering into tax-deferred like-kind exchanges under Section 1031 of the Code ( 1031 Exchange\u201d), when possible, to defer some or all of the taxable gains, if any, on dispositions.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we completed the sale of three properties and one industrial condominium unit for a total gross sales price of $33.6 million and total net cash proceeds of $32.3 million. The net cash proceeds were used to partially fund the acquisition of three properties during the year ended December 31, 2019, through 1031 Exchange transactions.\nWe anticipate continuing to selectively and opportunistically dispose of properties, however, the timing of any potential future dispositions will depend on market conditions, asset-specific circumstances or opportunities, and our capital needs. Our ability to dispose of selective properties on advantageous terms, or at all, is dependent upon a number of factors including the availability of credit to potential buyers to purchase properties at prices that we consider acceptable.\nAmended Credit Agreement\nOn February 13, 2020, we amended our $450 million credit facility (the Prior Credit Agreement\u201d) by entering into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Amended Credit Agreement\u201d), which provides for a $600.0 million senior unsecured credit facility, comprised of a $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the \"Amended Revolver\") and a $100.0 million unsecured term loan facility (the \"Amended Term Loan Facility\"). The Amended Revolver is scheduled to mature on February 13, 2024, and has two six-month extension options available for a maximum maturity date of February 13, 2025, subject to certain conditions and the payment of an additional fee. The Amended Term Loan Facility is scheduled to mature on February 14, 2022. Subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement, we may request additional lender commitments up to an additional aggregate $900.0 million, which may be comprised of additional revolving commitments under the Amended Revolver, an increase to the Amended Term Loan Facility, additional term loan tranches or any combination of the foregoing.\nInterest on the Amended Credit Agreement is generally to be paid based upon, at our option, either (i) LIBOR plus an applicable margin that is based upon our leverage ratio or (ii) the Base Rate (which is defined as the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the administrative agent's prime rate or (c) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.00%) plus an applicable margin that is based on our leverage ratio. The margins for the Amended Revolver range in amount from 1.05% to 1.50% per annum for LIBOR-based loans and 0.05% to 0.50% per annum for Base Rate-based loans, depending on our leverage ratio. The margins for the Amended Term Loan Facility range in amount from 1.20% to 1.70% per annum for LIBOR-based loans and 0.20% to 0.70% per annum for Base Rate-based loans, depending on our leverage ratio.\nIf we attain one additional investment grade rating by one or more of Standard & Poor's ( S&P\u201d) or Moody's Investor Services ( Moody's\u201d) to complement our current investment grade Fitch rating, we may elect to convert the pricing structure under the Amended Credit Agreement to be based on such rating. In that event, the margins for the Amended Revolver will range in amount from 0.725% to 1.40% per annum for LIBOR-based loans and 0.00% to 0.45% per annum for Base Rate-based loans, depending on such rating, and the margins for the Amended Term Loan Facility will range in amount from 0.85% to 1.65% per annum for LIBOR-based loans and 0.00% to 0.65% per annum for Base Rate-based loans, depending on such rating.\nIn addition to the interest payable on amounts outstanding under the Amended Revolver, we are required to pay an applicable facility fee, based upon our leverage ratio, on the aggregate amount of each lender's Revolving Credit Commitment (whether or not such Revolving Credit Commitment is drawn), as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement. The applicable facility fee will range in amount from 0.15% to 0.30% per annum, depending on our leverage ratio. In the event that we convert the pricing structure to be based on an investment-grade rating, the applicable facility fee will range in amount from 0.125% to 0.30% per annum, depending on such rating.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement is guaranteed by the Company and by substantially all of the current and to-be-formed subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership that own an unencumbered property. The Amended Credit Agreement is not secured by the Company's properties or by equity interests in the subsidiaries that hold such properties.\nThe Amended Revolver and the Amended Term Loan Facility may be voluntarily prepaid in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty. Amounts borrowed under the Amended Term Loan Facility and repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement contains usual and customary events of default including defaults in the payment of principal, interest or fees, defaults in compliance with the covenants set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement and other loan documentation, cross-defaults to certain other indebtedness, and bankruptcy and other insolvency defaults. If an event of default occurs and is continuing under the Amended Credit Agreement, the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding loans, together\nwith all accrued unpaid interest and other amounts owing in respect thereof, may be declared immediately due and payable.\nAs of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the Amended Revolver, leaving $500.0 million available for future borrowings.\nNote Purchase and Guarantee Agreement\nOn July 16, 2019, we entered into a Note Purchase and Guarantee Agreement (the NPGA\u201d) which provides for the private placement of $100.0 million of guaranteed senior notes, of which (i) $25.0 million are designated as 3.88% Series 2019A Guaranteed Senior Notes due July 16, 2029 (the \"Series 2019A Notes\") and (ii) $75.0 million are designated as 4.03% Series 2019B Guaranteed Senior Notes due July 16, 2034 (the \"Series 2019 B Notes\" and, together with the Series 2019A Notes, the \"Series 2019A and 2019B Notes\"). Interest on the Series 2019A and 2019B Notes will be payable semiannually on the sixteenth day of January and July in each year, beginning on January 16, 2020, until maturity. On July 16, 2019, we completed the issuance of the Series 2019A and 2019B Notes. We used the net proceeds from this issuance to fund the acquisition of industrial properties and for general corporate purposes.\nInvestment Grade Rating\nIn November 2019, Fitch Ratings affirmed our investment grade credit rating of BBB with a stable outlook on the Prior Credit Agreement, our $225 million unsecured term loan facility (the $225 Million Term Loan Facility\u201d), our $150 million unsecured term loan facility (the $150 Million Term Loan Facility\u201d), our $100 million unsecured guaranteed senior notes (the $100 Million Notes\u201d), our $125 million unsecured guaranteed senior notes (the $125 Million Notes\u201d) and the Series 2019A and 2019B Notes. They also affirmed our investment grade credit rating of BB+ on our 5.875% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, our 5.875% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and our Series C Preferred Stock. Our credit ratings are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analysis of us, and, although it is our intent to maintain our investment grade credit rating, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings. In the event our current credit ratings are downgraded, it may become difficult or more expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing indebtedness as maturities become due.\nUses of Liquidity\nAcquisitions\nOne of our most significant liquidity needs has historically been for the acquisition of real estate properties. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we acquired 40 properties with a combined 5.4 million rentable square feet for a total gross purchase price of $970.7 million, and we are actively monitoring a volume of properties in our markets that we believe represent attractive potential investment opportunities to continue to grow our business. As of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have approximately $268.4 million of acquisitions under contract or letter of intent. There can be no assurance we will complete any such acquisitions. While the actual number of acquisitions that we complete will be dependent upon a number of factors, in the short term, we expect to fund our acquisitions through available cash on hand, cash flows from operations, borrowings available under the Amended Revolver, recycling capital through property dispositions and, in the long term, through the issuance of equity securities or proceeds from long-term secured and unsecured financings.\nRecurring and Nonrecurring Capital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures are considered part of both our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred $6.8 million of recurring capital expenditures, which was an increase of $1.2 million over the prior year. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred $34.1 million of non-recurring capital expenditures, which was a decrease of $11.3 million over the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to the decrease in non-recurring capital expenditures related to redevelopment activity during 2019 compared to 2018. As discussed above under -Factors that May Influence Future Results -Acquisitions and Value-Add Repositioning and Development of Properties, as of December 31, 2019, 11 of our properties were in various stages of redevelopment and repositioning or lease-up, and we anticipate beginning repositioning work on three additional properties during 2020 and 2021. We currently estimate that approximately $110.6 million of capital will be required over the next eight quarters (1Q-2020 through 4Q-2021) to complete the redevelopment and repositioning of these properties. However, this estimate is based on our current construction plan and budgets, both of which are subject to change as a result of a number of factors. If we are unable to complete construction on schedule or within budget, we could incur increased construction costs and experience potential delays in leasing the properties. We expect to fund these projects through a combination of cash flow from operations, the issuance of common stock under the $550 Million ATM Program and borrowings available under the Amended Revolver.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth our principal obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2019, including (i) scheduled principal payments and debt maturities, (ii) periodic interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness and interest rate swaps, (iii) office lease payments and (iv) other contractual obligations (in thousands):\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 Year (2020)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years (2021-2022)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 Years (2023-2024)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 Years\n(After 2024)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments and debt maturities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>282,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>476,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>860,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments - fixed rate debt(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments - variable rate debt(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office lease payments(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual obligations(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>163,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>326,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>531,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,085,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Reflects scheduled interest payments on our fixed rate debt, including the $100 Million Notes, $125 Million Notes, Series 2019A and 2019B Notes and the Gilbert/La Palma mortgage loan.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Reflects an estimate of interest payments due on variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps.

To satisfy the requirements to qualify as a REIT and generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax, we intend to distribute a percentage of our cash flow on a quarterly basis to holders of our common stock. In addition, we intend to make distribution payments to holders of OP Units and dividend payments to holders of our preferred stock.\nOn February 10, 2020, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.215 per share of common stock and a quarterly cash distribution of $0.215 per OP Unit, to be paid on April 15, 2020, to holders of record as of March 31, 2020.

The increase was primarily attributable to incremental cash flows from property acquisitions completed subsequent to January 1, 2018, the increase in Cash NOI from our Same Properties Portfolio, changes in working capital and lower cash interest paid during 2019.\nNet cash used in investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities increased by $465.5 million to $972.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $507.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to a $463.7 million increase in cash paid for property acquisitions and acquisition related deposits and a $12.6 million decrease in net proceeds received from the sale of properties, partially offset by a $10.8 million decrease in cash paid for construction and repositioning projects.\nNet cash provided by financing activities.

These increases were partially offset by the following: (i) a decrease of $216.0 million in draws on the Revolver, (ii) a decrease of $150.0 million in borrowings on the $150 Million Term Loan Facility\nand (iii) an increase of $22.4 million in dividends and distributions paid to common stockholders and common unitholders resulting from the increase in the number of common shares outstanding and the increase in our quarterly per share cash dividend.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2018 to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nRefer to Item 7.

We estimate that, on a weighted average basis, in-place rents of leases scheduled to expire in 2020 and 2021 are currently below current market asking rates, although individual units or properties within any particular submarket may currently be leased either above, below, or at the current market asking rates within that submarket. As described in the above Market Fundamentals section, we expect market dynamics to remain strong heading into 2020 and that these positive trends will provide a favorable environment for additional increases in lease renewal rates. Accordingly, we expect 2020 will show positive renewal rates and leasing spreads. We also currently do not see any reason not to expect that 2021 lease expirations will show positive growth upon renewal; however, it is difficult to predict market conditions that far into the future.\n (7) We acquired Conejo Spectrum Business Park, a nine-building property during the first quarter of 2019.

expedient\u201d in ASC 842 that alleviates the requirement to separately present lease and non-lease components of lease contracts if certain criteria are met. As a result, we account for and present all rental income earned pursuant to tenant leases, including tenant reimbursements, as a single component in one line, Rental income,\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations. Prior to the adoption ASC 842, we presented rental revenue, tenant reimbursements and other income related to leases separately in our consolidated statements of operations. However, to facilitate comparability, we have reclassified 2018 amounts to conform with 2019 presentation. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 of this Report on Form 10-K for disclosure related to the adoption of ASC 842.\nAs of December 31, 2019, eight of our properties were in various stages of repositioning or development and three of our properties were in the lease-up stage. In addition, we anticipate beginning repositioning/redevelopment work on three additional properties in the near future. The table below sets forth a summary of these properties, as well as the seven projects that were stabilized during 2019 and the four properties that were stabilized during 2018, as the timing of these stabilizations have a direct impact on our current and comparative results of operations. In addition to the properties in the table below, we also have a range of smaller spaces in value-add repositioning or renovation, that due to their smaller size and relatively nominal amount of down-time, are not presented below, however, in the aggregate, may be substantial.\n (5) The Merge is a fully entitled industrial development site on which we plan to build six industrial buildings totaling 333,491 rentable square feet. \nTable 243: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>139,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>102,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(972,742\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(507,213\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(465,529\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>731,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>578,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 For the Senior Notes, maintaining a minimum tangible net worth of at least the sum of (i) $760,740,750, and (ii) an amount equal to at least 75% of the net equity proceeds received by the Company after September 30, 2016; \nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2018 to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nAcquisitions\n \u2022 Maintaining a minimum Fair Market Net Worth (as defined in the term loan agreement) of at least $75 million, to be tested annually as of December 31 of each year.

In order to mitigate these risks, we perform credit reviews and analyses on prospective tenants before significant leases are executed and on existing tenants before properties are acquired. On a quarterly basis, we perform an assessment of the collectability of operating lease receivables on a tenant-by-tenant basis, which includes reviewing the age and nature of our receivables, the payment history and financial condition of the tenant, our assessment of the tenant's ability to meet its lease obligations and the status of negotiations of any disputes with the tenant. Any changes in the collectability assessment for an operating lease is recognized as an adjustment, which can be a reduction or increase, to rental income in the consolidated statements of operations. As a result of our quarterly collectability assessments, we recognized $0.7 million and $1.2 million, $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively, as a reduction of rental income in the consolidated statements of operations.\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 Year (2020)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years (2021-2022)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 Years (2023-2024)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 Years\n(After 2024)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments and debt maturities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>282,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>476,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>860,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments - fixed rate debt(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments - variable rate debt(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office lease payments(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual obligations(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>163,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>326,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>531,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,085,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Amended Revolver and the Amended Term Loan Facility may be voluntarily prepaid in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty.

At December 31, 2019, we had total indebtedness of $861.0 million, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discounts, with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.54% and an average term-to-maturity of 5.5 years. As of December 31, 2019, $802.5 million, or 93%, of our outstanding indebtedness had an interest rate that was effectively fixed under either the terms of the loan ($327.5 million) or an interest rate swap ($475.0 million).\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for the reporting periods. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates and assumptions. We have summarized below those accounting policies that require material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on financial condition and results of operations. Management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis, based upon information currently available and on various assumptions that it believes are reasonable as of the date hereof. In addition, other companies in similar businesses may use different estimation policies and methodologies, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations and financial condition to those of other companies.\nIn addition to the interest payable on amounts outstanding under the Amended Revolver, we are required to pay an applicable facility fee, based upon our leverage ratio, on the aggregate amount of each lender's Revolving Credit Commitment (whether or not such Revolving Credit Commitment is drawn), as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement. The applicable facility fee will range in amount from 0.15% to 0.30% per annum, depending on our leverage ratio. In the event that we convert the pricing structure to be based on an investment-grade rating, the applicable facility fee will range in amount from 0.125% to 0.30% per annum, depending on such rating.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to NOI and Cash NOI (in thousands):\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2019 to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nOn February 10, 2020, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.215 per share of common stock and a quarterly cash distribution of $0.215 per OP Unit, to be paid on April 15, 2020, to holders of record as of March 31, 2020. Also, on February 10, 2020, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.367188 per share of our 5.875% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, a quarterly cash dividend of $0.367188 per share of our 5.875% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, a quarterly cash dividend of $0.351563 per share of our Series C Preferred Stock and a quarterly cash distribution of $0.505085 per Series 1 CPOP Unit to be paid on March 31, 2020, to holders of record as of March 13, 2020.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2019 to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nThe Amended Credit Agreement is guaranteed by the Company and by substantially all of the current and to-be-formed subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership that own an unencumbered property. The Amended Credit Agreement is not secured by the Company's properties or by equity interests in the subsidiaries that hold such properties.\nFactors That May Influence Future Results of Operations\n (1) Amount relates to the Company's acquisition of the remaining 85% ownership interest in the property located at 3233 Mission Oaks Boulevard from a prior unconsolidated joint venture. For additional information, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Report on Form 10-K. \n \u2022 Maintaining a ratio of total unsecured debt to total unencumbered asset value of not more than 60%; \n (7) As of December 31, 2019, the $100 Million Term Loan Facility has been effectively fixed at 1.764% plus an applicable LIBOR margin through the use of an interest rate swap with a notional value of $100.0 million and an effective date of December 14, 2018. \nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nRexford Industrial Realty, Inc. is a self-administered and self-managed full-service REIT focused on owning and operating industrial properties in Southern California infill markets. We were formed as a Maryland corporation on January 18,\nIf we attain one additional investment grade rating by one or more of Standard & Poor's ( S&P\u201d) or Moody's Investor Services ( Moody's\u201d) to complement our current investment grade Fitch rating, we may elect to convert the pricing structure under the Amended Credit Agreement to be based on such rating. In that event, the margins for the Amended Revolver will range in amount from 0.725% to 1.40% per annum for LIBOR-based loans and 0.00% to 0.45% per annum for Base Rate-based loans, depending on such rating, and the margins for the Amended Term Loan Facility will range in amount from 0.85% to 1.65% per annum for LIBOR-based loans and 0.00% to 0.65% per annum for Base Rate-based loans, depending on such rating.\n (3) Participating securities include unvested shares of restricted stock, unvested LTIP units of partnership interest in our Operating Partnership and unvested performance units in our Operating Partnership. \n (8) 9615 Norwalk Boulevard is a 10.26 acre storage-yard with three buildings totaling 38,362 rentable square feet. In January 2019, we converted the tenant's month to month land lease to a term lease with an expiration date of June 30, 2020. We will demolish the existing buildings and construct a new 201,808 rentable square foot building upon termination of the land lease. \nAs of December 31, 2019, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nOur operating results depend upon the infill Southern California industrial real estate market.\nCalifornia Proposition 13 annual increases and property reassessments, lower capitalized real estate tax expense due to completed repositioning activity, as well as increases in allocated overhead costs and insurance expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in real estate tax expense due to the adoption of ASC 842 and the change in reporting for real estate taxes that are paid directly by a lessee to a third party from a gross basis to a net basis at three of our properties. Our Total Portfolio property expenses were also impacted by incremental expenses from the 70 properties we acquired during 2018 and 2019, partially offset by the decrease in property expenses from the nine properties that were sold during 2018 and 2019.\nOur Same Properties Portfolio and Total Portfolio other income increased by $0.4 million, or 45.9%, and $0.5 million, or 58.8%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase in miscellaneous income.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold a total of 16,817,930 shares of our common stock under the $550 Million ATM Program and the Prior ATM Program at a weighted average price of $38.61 per share, for gross proceeds of $649.3 million, and net proceeds of $639.6 million, after deducting the sales agents' fee. As of December 31, 2019, we had the capacity to issue up to an additional $350.7 million of common stock under the $550 Million ATM Program.\nCash Flows\n\nValuation of Receivables\nRevenue Recognition\nOn February 13, 2020, we amended our $450 million credit facility (the Prior Credit Agreement\u201d) by entering into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Amended Credit Agreement\u201d), which provides for a $600.0 million senior unsecured credit facility, comprised of a $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the \"Amended Revolver\") and a $100.0 million unsecured term loan facility (the \"Amended Term Loan Facility\"). The Amended Revolver is scheduled to mature on February 13, 2024, and has two six-month extension options available for a maximum maturity date of February 13, 2025, subject to certain conditions and the payment of an additional fee. The Amended Term Loan Facility is scheduled to mature on February 14, 2022. Subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement, we may request additional lender commitments up to an additional aggregate $900.0 million, which may be comprised of additional revolving commitments under the Amended Revolver, an increase to the Amended Term Loan Facility, additional term loan tranches or any combination of the foregoing.\nOur Total Portfolio interest expense increased by $1.5 million, or 5.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in interest expense is primarily comprised of the following: (i) a $2.3 million increase related to the $150.0 million term loan facility borrowing that we completed in May 2018, (ii) a $1.8 million increase related to the private placement of $100.0 million of senior notes that we completed in July 2019 and (iii) a $0.5 million increase related to the $150 million swap that became effective in July 2019. These increases were partially offset by (i) a $1.8 million increase in capitalized interest related to our repositioning and redevelopment properties and (ii) a $1.1 million decrease in interest related to lower average outstanding borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility.\n\nOur ability to re-lease space subject to expiring leases is affected by economic and competitive conditions in our markets and by the desirability of our individual properties, which may impact our results of operations.\n \u2022 For the Amended Credit Agreement, $225 Million Term Loan Facility and $150 Million Term Loan Facility, maintaining a ratio of secured debt to total asset value of not more than 45%; \n(1) Rental Revenue\n \u2022 In September 2019, we completed a public offering of 3,450,000 shares of our 5.625% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at a price of $25.00 per share, for net proceeds of approximately $83.2 million after deducting the underwriters' discount and offering costs.  Financing\nDebt Covenants\nand (iii) an increase of $22.4 million in dividends and distributions paid to common stockholders and common unitholders resulting from the increase in the number of common shares outstanding and the increase in our quarterly per share cash dividend.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement, $225 Million Term Loan Facility, $150 Million Term Loan Facility, $100 Million Notes, $125 Million Notes and Series 2019A and 2019B Notes all include a series of financial and other covenants that we must comply with, including the following covenants which are tested on a quarterly basis:\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nAssumptions and estimates used in the recoverability analyses for future cash flows, discount rates and capitalization rates are complex and subjective. Changes in economic and operating conditions or our intent with respect to our investment that occur subsequent to our impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment of our real estate properties.\nManagement, Leasing and Development Services\nThe following tables set forth our leasing activity for new and renewal leases on a quarterly basis for the year ended December 31, 2019:\nCapital expenditures are considered part of both our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred $6.8 million of recurring capital expenditures, which was an increase of $1.2 million over the prior year. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred $34.1 million of non-recurring capital expenditures, which was a decrease of $11.3 million over the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to the decrease in non-recurring capital expenditures related to redevelopment activity during 2019 compared to 2018. As discussed above under -Factors that May Influence Future Results -Acquisitions and Value-Add Repositioning and Development of Properties, as of December 31, 2019, 11 of our properties were in various stages of redevelopment and repositioning or lease-up, and we anticipate beginning repositioning work on three additional properties during 2020 and 2021. We currently estimate that approximately $110.6 million of capital will be required over the next eight quarters (1Q-2020 through 4Q-2021) to complete the redevelopment and repositioning of these properties. However, this estimate is based on our current construction plan and budgets, both of which are subject to change as a result of a number of factors. If we are unable to complete construction on schedule or within budget, we could incur increased construction costs and experience potential delays in leasing the properties. We expect to fund these projects through a combination of cash flow from operations, the issuance of common stock under the $550 Million ATM Program and borrowings available under the Amended Revolver.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had total indebtedness of $861.0 million, reflecting a net debt to total combined market capitalization of approximately 12.3%. Our total market capitalization is defined as the sum of the liquidation preference of our outstanding preferred stock and preferred units plus the market value of our common stock excluding shares of nonvested restricted stock, plus the aggregate value of common units not owned by us, plus the value of our net debt. Our net debt is defined as our consolidated indebtedness less cash and cash equivalents.\nRental Income\nATM Program\n (6) Includes two leases totaling 132,650 rentable square feet that expired during the year ended December 31, 2019, for which the space was placed into repositioning after each tenant vacated. \nThe following critical accounting policies discussion reflects what we believe are the most significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. For further discussion of our significant accounting policies and discussion of new accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 of this report on Form 10-K.\nIn determining the fair value of intangible lease assets or liabilities, we also consider Level 3 inputs. Acquired above- and below-market leases are valued based on the present value of the difference between prevailing market rates and the in-place rates measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases, if applicable. The estimated fair value of acquired in-place at-market tenant leases are the costs that would have been incurred to lease the property to the occupancy level of the property at the date of acquisition. Such estimates include the value associated with leasing commissions, legal and other costs, as well as the estimated period necessary to lease such property to its occupancy level at the time of its acquisition. In determining the fair value of acquisitions completed during the year ended December 31, 2019, we used an estimated average lease-up period ranging from six to twelve months.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2019, our consolidated portfolio, inclusive of space in repositioning as described in the subsequent paragraph, was approximately 96.1% occupied, while our stabilized consolidated portfolio exclusive of such space was approximately 97.9% occupied. We believe the opportunity to increase occupancy at our properties will be an important driver of future revenue growth. An opportunity to drive this growth will derive from the lease-up of recently completed repositioning projects and the completion and lease-up of repositioning and development projects that are currently under construction and planned for near-term construction.\nOne of our most significant liquidity needs has historically been for the acquisition of real estate properties. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we acquired 40 properties with a combined 5.4 million rentable square feet for a total gross purchase price of $970.7 million, and we are actively monitoring a volume of properties in our markets that we believe represent attractive potential investment opportunities to continue to grow our business. As of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have approximately $268.4 million of acquisitions under contract or letter of intent. There can be no assurance we will complete any such acquisitions. While the actual number of acquisitions that we complete will be dependent upon a number of factors, in the short term, we expect to fund our acquisitions through available cash on hand, cash flows from operations, borrowings available under the Amended Revolver, recycling capital through property dispositions and, in the long term, through the issuance of equity securities or proceeds from long-term secured and unsecured financings.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur primary sources of revenue are rental income, management, leasing and development services and gains on sale of real estate.\nOn September 20, 2019, we completed an underwritten public offering of 3,450,000 shares of our 5.625% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the Series C Preferred Stock\u201d), including 450,000 additional shares of Series C Preferred Stock pursuant to an option to purchase additional shares solely to cover over-allotments, at a price of $25.00 per share. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $83.2 million after deducting the underwriters' discount and offering costs totaling $3.0 million. We used the net proceeds from the offering to fund various acquisitions and for general corporate purposes.\nNon-GAAP Supplemental Measure: EBITDAre\nRefer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Cash Flows\u201d in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on February 19, 2019, for a discussion of the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\nOur property expenses generally consist of utilities, real estate taxes, insurance, site repair and maintenance costs, and the allocation of overhead costs. For the majority of our properties, our property expenses are recovered, in part, by either the triple net provisions or modified gross expense reimbursements in tenant leases. The majority of our leases also comprise contractual three percent annual rental rate increases meant, in part, to help mitigate potential increases in property expenses over time. However, the terms of our leases vary and, in some instances, we may absorb property expenses. Our overall financial results will be impacted by the extent to which we are able to pass-through property expenses to our tenants.\n \u2022 Maintaining a ratio of unencumbered NOI (as defined in each of the loan agreements) to unsecured interest expense of at least 1.75 to 1.0.  The Amended Credit Agreement, $225 Million Term Loan Facility, $150 Million Term Loan Facility and Senior Notes also contain limitations on our ability to pay distributions on our common stock. Specifically, our cash dividends may not exceed the greater of (1) 95% of our FFO (as defined in the credit agreement) and (2) the amount required for us to qualify and maintain our REIT status. If an event of default exists, we may only make distributions sufficient to qualify and maintain our REIT status.\nAcquisitions and Value-Add Repositioning and Development of Properties\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe believe that EBITDAre is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of our operating performance as a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of our properties. We also use this measure in ratios to compare our performance to that of our industry peers. In addition, we believe EBITDAre is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of equity REITs. However, our industry peers may not calculate EBITDAre in accordance with the NAREIT definition as we do and, accordingly, our EBITDAre may not be comparable to our peers' EBITDAre. Accordingly, EBITDAre should be considered only as a supplement to net income (loss) as a measure of our performance.\nGeneral and Administrative\n \u2022 During 2019, we sold three properties and one industrial condominium unit with a combined 0.2 million rentable square feet, for a total gross sales price of $33.6 million, and total net cash proceeds of $32.3 million.  Equity\n (3) We expect to demolish the existing 49,976 rentable square foot building and construct a new 90,856 rentable square foot multi-unit building. \n(3) Other Income\nNet cash provided by financing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities increased by $153.3 million to $731.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $578.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to the following: (i) a decrease of $276.0 million in paydowns on the Revolver, (ii) an increase of $100.0 million in cash proceeds from the issuance of the Series 2019A and 2019B Notes in July 2019, (iii) an increase of $83.2 million in net cash proceeds from the issuance of the Series C Preferred Stock and (iv) an increase of $82.4 million in net cash proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock. These increases were partially offset by the following: (i) a decrease of $216.0 million in draws on the Revolver, (ii) a decrease of $150.0 million in borrowings on the $150 Million Term Loan Facility\nOur Total Portfolio management, leasing and development services revenue decreased by $0.1 million, or 14.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\n (9) We expect to demolish the existing 70,510 rentable square foot building and construct a new 128,350 rentable square foot building. \n (10) We consider a repositioning property to be stabilized upon the earlier of (i) reaching 90% occupancy or (ii) one year from the date construction work is completed. \nThe following table reports the breakdown of 2019 rental income, as reported prior to the adoption of ASC 842, and compares this breakdown with 2018 amounts for the comparable period (dollars in thousands). We believe that the below presentation of rental income is not, and is not intended to be, a presentation in accordance with GAAP. We are presenting this information because we believe it is frequently used by management, investors, securities analysts and other interested parties to evaluate the Company's performance.\nWe evaluated the acquisitions that we completed during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, and determined that under this framework these transactions should be accounted for as asset acquisitions. Our acquisitions of properties generally no longer meet the revised definition of a business and accordingly are accounted for as asset acquisitions.\nwith all accrued unpaid interest and other amounts owing in respect thereof, may be declared immediately due and payable.\n (8) As of December 31, 2019, the $225 Million Term Loan Facility has been effectively fixed at 1.374% plus the applicable LIBOR margin through the use of two interest rate swaps as follows: (i) $125 million with a strike rate of 1.349% and an effective date of February 14, 2018, and (ii) $100 million with a strike rate of 1.406% and an effective date of August 14, 2018, plus the applicable LIBOR margin. \nOn July 16, 2019, we entered into a Note Purchase and Guarantee Agreement (the NPGA\u201d) which provides for the private placement of $100.0 million of guaranteed senior notes, of which (i) $25.0 million are designated as 3.88% Series 2019A Guaranteed Senior Notes due July 16, 2029 (the \"Series 2019A Notes\") and (ii) $75.0 million are designated as 4.03% Series 2019B Guaranteed Senior Notes due July 16, 2034 (the \"Series 2019 B Notes\" and, together with the Series 2019A Notes, the \"Series 2019A and 2019B Notes\"). Interest on the Series 2019A and 2019B Notes will be payable semiannually on the sixteenth day of January and July in each year, beginning on January 16, 2020, until maturity. On July 16, 2019, we completed the issuance of the Series 2019A and 2019B Notes. We used the net proceeds from this issuance to fund the acquisition of industrial properties and for general corporate purposes.\nCompany Overview\nInterest on the Amended Credit Agreement is generally to be paid based upon, at our option, either (i) LIBOR plus an applicable margin that is based upon our leverage ratio or (ii) the Base Rate (which is defined as the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the administrative agent's prime rate or (c) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.00%) plus an applicable margin that is based on our leverage ratio. The margins for the Amended Revolver range in amount from 1.05% to 1.50% per annum for LIBOR-based loans and 0.05% to 0.50% per annum for Base Rate-based loans, depending on our leverage ratio. The margins for the Amended Term Loan Facility range in amount from 1.20% to 1.70% per annum for LIBOR-based loans and 0.20% to 0.70% per annum for Base Rate-based loans, depending on our leverage ratio.\n (6) The LIBOR margin will range from 1.10% to 1.50% per annum for the Revolver, 1.20% to 1.70% per annum for our $100 million term loan facility (the $100 Million Term Loan Facility\u201d), 1.20% to 1.70% per annum for the $225 Million Term Loan Facility and 1.50% to 2.20% per annum for the $150 Million Term Loan Facility, depending on our leverage ratio, which is the ratio of our outstanding consolidated indebtedness to the value of our consolidated gross asset value. This leverage ratio is measured on a quarterly basis, and as a result, the effective interest rate will fluctuate from period to period. \nIn Ventura County, there was a slight increase in vacancy year-over-year and a slight increase in asking lease rates year-over year.\n (6) We expect to demolish the existing 63,900 rentable square foot building and construct a new 96,950 rentable square foot building. \n (2) Excludes unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts totaling $3.1 million as of December 31, 2019. \nA critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity's financial condition and results of operations and requires judgment on the part of management. Generally, the judgment requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates are prepared using management's best judgment, after considering past and current economic conditions and expectations for the future. Changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by the users of our financial statements in their evaluation of our performance.\n (1) Reflects scheduled interest payments on our fixed rate debt, including the $100 Million Notes, $125 Million Notes, Series 2019A and 2019B Notes and the Gilbert/La Palma mortgage loan. \nWe provide property management services and leasing services to related party and third-party property owners (the customer\u201d) in exchange for fees and commissions.\n\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2018 to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nAcquisitions\nIn November 2019, Fitch Ratings affirmed our investment grade credit rating of BBB with a stable outlook on the Prior Credit Agreement, our $225 million unsecured term loan facility (the $225 Million Term Loan Facility\u201d), our $150 million unsecured term loan facility (the $150 Million Term Loan Facility\u201d), our $100 million unsecured guaranteed senior notes (the $100 Million Notes\u201d), our $125 million unsecured guaranteed senior notes (the $125 Million Notes\u201d) and the Series 2019A and 2019B Notes. They also affirmed our investment grade credit rating of BB+ on our 5.875% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, our 5.875% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and our Series C Preferred Stock. Our credit ratings are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analysis of us, and, although it is our intent to maintain our investment grade credit rating, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings. In the event our current credit ratings are downgraded, it may become difficult or more expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing indebtedness as maturities become due.\nRecurring and Nonrecurring Capital Expenditures\nWe calculate earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization for real estate ( EBITDAre\u201d) in accordance with the standards established by NAREIT. EBITDAre is calculated as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, impairment losses and adjustments to reflect our proportionate share of EBITDAre from our prior unconsolidated joint venture.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement contains usual and customary events of default including defaults in the payment of principal, interest or fees, defaults in compliance with the covenants set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement and other loan documentation, cross-defaults to certain other indebtedness, and bankruptcy and other insolvency defaults. If an event of default occurs and is continuing under the Amended Credit Agreement, the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding loans, together\nInvestment in Real Estate\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized a total gain on sale of real estate of $16.3 million from the disposition of three properties and one industrial condominium unit that were sold for an aggregate gross sales price of $33.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized a total gain on sale of real estate of $17.2 million from the disposition of six properties that were sold for an aggregate gross sales price of $48.0 million.\n\n (4) Includes total commitments for tenant improvement and construction work related to obligations under certain tenant leases and vendor contracts. We anticipate these obligations to be paid as incurred in 2020 and 2021, however, as the timing of these obligations is subject to a number of factors, for purposes of this table, we have included the full amount under Less than 1 Year (2020).\u201d  Dividends and Distributions\nLeasing Activity and Rental Rates\n (7) Retention is calculated as renewal lease square footage plus relocation/expansion square footage, divided by the square footage of leases expiring during the period. Retention excludes expiring leases associated with space that is placed into repositioning after the tenant vacates.  Our leasing activity is impacted both by our redevelopment and repositioning efforts, as well as by market conditions. While we reposition a property, its space may become unavailable for leasing until completion of our repositioning efforts. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we stabilized 14748-14750 Nelson Avenue, 1998 Surveyor Avenue, 15401 Figueroa Street, 1332-1340 Rocky Point Drive, 1580 Carson Street and 3233 Mission Oaks Boulevard - Unit 3233 with a combined 524,050 rentable square feet. As of December 31, 2019, we have six current repositioning projects and two development projects with estimated construction completion periods ranging from the first quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021. Additionally, we have three properties in the lease-up stage. We expect these properties to have positive impacts on our leasing activity and revenue generation as we complete our value-add repositioning plans and place these properties in service.\n (1) Includes the effect of interest rate swaps that were effective as of December 31, 2019. Assumes a 1-month LIBOR rate of 1.7625% as of December 31, 2019, as applicable. Excludes the effect of amortization of debt issuance costs, discounts and the facility fee on the Revolver. \nManagement uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions, and asset impairments, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of performance used by other REITs, FFO may be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs.\nWe capitalized interest costs of $3.9 million, $2.1 million and $1.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We capitalized real estate taxes and insurance aggregating $1.3 million, $0.9 million and $1.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We capitalized compensation costs for employees who provide construction services of $2.7 million, $2.2 million and $1.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n (4) The Revolver is subject to an applicable facility fee which is calculated as a percentage of the total lenders' commitment amount, regardless of usage. The applicable facility fee will range from 0.15% to 0.30% depending upon our leverage ratio. \nRental Income\nWe use NOI as a supplemental performance measure because, in excluding real estate depreciation and amortization expense, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, gains (or losses) on sale of real estate and other non-operating items, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that NOI will be useful to investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because NOI excludes depreciation and amortization expense and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties (all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our results from operations), the utility of NOI as a measure of our performance is limited. Other equity REITs may not calculate NOI in a similar manner and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to such other REITs' NOI. Accordingly, NOI should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of our performance. NOI should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. NOI should not be used as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities in accordance with GAAP.\nRental Revenue\nWe continuously evaluate opportunities for the potential disposition of properties in our portfolio when we believe such disposition is appropriate in view of our business objectives. In evaluating these opportunities, we consider a variety of criteria including, but not limited to, local market conditions and lease rates, asset type and location, as well as potential uses of proceeds and tax considerations. Tax considerations include entering into tax-deferred like-kind exchanges under Section 1031 of the Code ( 1031 Exchange\u201d), when possible, to defer some or all of the taxable gains, if any, on dispositions.\n\nOur lease agreements with tenants generally contain provisions that require tenants to reimburse us for certain property expenses. Estimated reimbursements from tenants for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and other recoverable operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period that the expenses are incurred. Subsequent to year-end, we perform final reconciliations on a lease-by-lease basis and bill or credit each tenant for any cumulative annual adjustments.\nA key component of our growth strategy is to acquire properties through off-market and lightly marketed transactions that are often operating at below-market occupancy or below-market rent at the time of acquisition or that have near-term lease roll-over or that provide opportunities to add value through functional or physical repositioning and improvements. Through various redevelopment, repositioning, and professional leasing and marketing strategies, we seek to increase the properties' functionality and attractiveness to prospective tenants and, over time, to stabilize the properties at occupancy rates that meet or exceed market rates.\nThe following table summarizes the composition of our consolidated debt between fixed-rate and variable-rate and secured and unsecured debt as of December 31, 2019:\nIn accordance with the provisions of the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets Subsections of ASC Topic 360: Property, Plant, and Equipment, we assess the carrying values of our respective long-lived assets, including goodwill, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable.\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds to pay for operating expenses, interest expense, general and administrative expenses, capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing commissions, and distributions to our common and preferred stockholders and holders of common units of partnership interests in our Operating Partnership ( OP Units\u201d). We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through available cash on hand, cash flow from operations, by drawing on our unsecured revolving credit facility and by issuing shares of common stock pursuant to the at-the-market equity offering program described below.\nAcquisition Expenses\nIn Los Angeles County, positive market trends continued through 2019, as high tenant demand kept vacancy at historically low levels and average asking lease rates increased significantly during 2019. Current market conditions indicate rents are likely to continue their upward trend with potential increases through 2020, as occupancy still remains at near capacity levels and new development is limited by a lack of land availability and an increase in land and development costs.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our Operating Partnership indirectly and wholly owns Rexford Industrial Realty and Management, Inc., which we refer to as the services company. We have elected, together with our services company, to treat our services company as a taxable REIT subsidiary for federal income tax purposes. A taxable REIT subsidiary generally may provide non-customary and other services to our tenants and engage in activities that we may not engage in directly without adversely affecting our qualification as a REIT, provided a taxable REIT subsidiary may not operate or manage a lodging facility or health care facility or provide rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility or health care facility is operated. We may form additional taxable REIT subsidiaries in the future, and our Operating Partnership may contribute some or all of its interests in certain wholly owned subsidiaries or their assets to our services company. Any income earned by our taxable REIT subsidiaries will not be included in our taxable income for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests, except to the extent such income is distributed to us as a dividend, in which case such dividend income will qualify under the 95%, but not the 75%, gross income test. Because a taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to federal income tax, and state and local income tax (where applicable) as a regular corporation, the income earned by our taxable REIT subsidiaries generally will be subject to an additional level of tax as compared to the income earned by our other subsidiaries. Our taxable REIT subsidiary is a C-corporation subject to federal and state income tax. However it has a cumulative unrecognized net operation loss carryforward and therefore there is no income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nProperty management services include performing property inspections, monitoring repairs and maintenance, negotiating vendor contracts, maintaining tenant relations and providing financial and accounting oversight. For these services, we earn monthly management fees, which are based on a fixed percentage of each managed property's monthly tenant cash receipts. We have determined that control over the services is passed to the customer simultaneously as performance occurs. Accordingly, management fee revenue is earned as services are provided to the customer.\nThe occupancy rate of properties not undergoing repositioning is affected by regional and local economic conditions in our Southern California infill markets. Throughout 2019, the Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego county markets continued to show historically low vacancy and positive absorption, resulting from high tenant demand combined with low product availability. Accordingly, our properties in these markets have exhibited a similar trend. We expect general market conditions to remain positive in 2020, and we believe the opportunity to increase occupancy and rental rates at our properties will be an important driver of future revenue growth.\n \u2022 Maintaining Unencumbered Liquid Assets (as defined in the term loan agreement) of not less than (i) $5 million, or (ii) $8 million if we elect to have Line of Credit Availability (as defined in the term loan agreement) included in the calculation, of which $2 million must be cash or cash equivalents, to be tested annually as of December 31 of each year; \nOur Total Portfolio interest income increased by $1.2 million, or 85.4%, during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase in the average cash balance invested in money market accounts.\nEquity Offerings\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our Same Properties Portfolio occupancy was approximately 97.4% and 96.0%, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our Same Properties Portfolio weighted average occupancy was approximately 96.8% and 95.6%, respectively. These occupancy changes were partially driven by the completion of repositioning and development work and subsequent lease-up of space at the following six properties in our Same Properties Portfolio during the period from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019: (i) 14748-14750 Nelson Avenue, (ii) 3233 Mission Oaks Boulevard,\nAs summarized in the table under Acquisitions and Value-Add Repositioning and Development of Properties\u201d above, as of December 31, 2019, eight of our properties that will have a combined 1.1 million rentable square feet at completion are in current repositioning or development, and three properties with 0.2 million rentable square feet are in lease-up. Vacant repositioning space and lease-up space at these 11 properties are concentrated in our Los Angeles, Orange County, Ventura and San Diego markets, and represent 1.9% of our total consolidated portfolio square footage as of December 31, 2019. Including vacant repositioning and lease-up space at these 11 properties, our weighted average occupancy rate as of December 31, 2019, in Los Angeles, Orange County, Ventura and San Diego was 96.9%, 96.3%, 94.6% and 91.4%, respectively. Excluding vacant repositioning and lease-up space at these 11 properties, our weighted average occupancy rate as of December 31, 2019, in these markets was 98.8%, 96.9%, 98.9% and 94.8%, respectively. We believe that an important portion of our long-term future growth will come from the completion of these projects currently under or scheduled for repositioning, as well as through the identification or acquisition of new opportunities for redevelopment and repositioning, whether in our existing portfolio or through new investments, which may vary from period to period subject to market conditions.\nOur Total Portfolio general and administrative expenses increased by $5.1 million, or 20.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase is primarily due to increases in payroll related expenses due to a higher headcount, non-cash equity compensation expense, accrued bonus expense and other various corporate expenses, partially offset by a decrease in legal expense.\nAcquisitions\nTaxable REIT Subsidiary\n\nNon-GAAP Supplemental Measure: Funds From Operations\nOur Same Properties Portfolio depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $0.5 million, or 0.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to acquisition-related tenant improvements and in-place lease intangibles becoming fully depreciated during 2018 and 2019, partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense related to capital improvements placed into service during 2018 and 2019. Our Total Portfolio depreciation and amortization expense increased by $18.8 million, or 23.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to incremental expense from the 70 properties we acquired during 2018 and 2019, and an increase in depreciation expense related to capital improvements, partially offset by the decrease in our Same Properties Portfolio depreciation and amortization expense noted above.\nIn Orange County, market fundamentals remained favorable throughout 2019. With steady tenant demand and a continued low availability of industrial product in this region, average asking lease rates continued their upward trend during 2019 and vacancy remained at historically low levels. Current regional market conditions indicate the potential for continued rental growth through 2020.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nCash flow from operations is one of our key sources of liquidity and is primarily dependent upon: (i) the occupancy levels and lease rates at our properties, (ii) our ability to collect rent, (iii) the level of operating costs we incur and (iv) our ability to pass through operating expenses to our tenants. We are subject to a number of risks related to general economic and other unpredictable conditions, which have the potential to affect our overall performance and resulting cash flows from operations. However, based on our current portfolio mix and business strategy, we anticipate that we will be able to generate positive cash flows from operations.\n (3) One 24-month extension is available at the borrower's option, subject to certain terms and conditions. \n (1) Effective rent per square foot is the average base rent calculated in accordance with GAAP, over the term of the lease, expressed in dollars per square foot per year. Includes all new and renewal leases that were executed during each respective quarter. \nOur Same Properties Portfolio and Total Portfolio tenant reimbursements revenue increased by $0.8 million, or 2.9%, and $8.2 million or 25.5%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in our Same Properties Portfolio tenant reimbursements is primarily due to an increase in the weighted average occupancy for comparable periods, which was partially driven by the lease-up of the six SPP Stabilized Properties, and an increase in reimbursable property expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in tenant reimbursements revenue due to the adoption of ASC 842 and the related change in reporting for real estate taxes that are paid directly by a lessee to a third party, from a gross basis to a net basis, at three of our properties. Our Total Portfolio tenant reimbursements revenue was also impacted by the incremental reimbursements from the 70 properties we acquired during 2018 and 2019, partially offset by the decrease in reimbursements from the nine properties that were sold during 2018 and 2019.\nCapitalization of Costs\nProperty Expenses\n(iii) 301-445 Figueroa Street, (iv) 28903 Avenue Paine, (v) 15401 Figueroa Street and (vi) 1601 Alton Parkway (collectively, the SPP Stabilized Properties\u201d).\nNet cash used in investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities increased by $465.5 million to $972.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $507.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to a $463.7 million increase in cash paid for property acquisitions and acquisition related deposits and a $12.6 million decrease in net proceeds received from the sale of properties, partially offset by a $10.8 million decrease in cash paid for construction and repositioning projects.\nThe majority of our leases are either triple net or provide for tenant reimbursement for costs related to real estate taxes and operating expenses. In addition, most of the leases provide for fixed rent increases. We believe that inflationary increases to real estate taxes, utility expenses and other operating expenses may be partially offset by the contractual rent increases and tenant payment of taxes and expenses described above. We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our historical financial position or results of operations.\n\nWe account for dispositions of real estate properties, which are considered nonfinancial assets, in accordance with ASC 610-20: Other Income-Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets and recognize a gain or loss on sale of real estate upon transferring control of the nonfinancial asset to the purchaser, which is generally satisfied at the time of sale. If we were to conduct a partial sale of real estate by transferring a controlling interest in a nonfinancial asset, while retaining a noncontrolling ownership interest, we would measure any noncontrolling interest received or retained at fair value, and recognize a full gain or loss. If we receive consideration before transferring control of a nonfinancial asset, we recognize a contract liability. If we transfer control of the asset before consideration is received, we recognize a contract asset.\nMarket Fundamentals\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to FFO (in thousands):\n \u2022 During 2019, we acquired 40 properties, with a combined 5.4 million rentable square feet, for an aggregate cost of $970.7 million.  Repositioning\nSources of Liquidity\nCapital Recycling\nConsolidated Indebtedness\n (2) Noncontrolling interests represent (i) holders of outstanding common units of the Company's Operating Partnership that are owned by unit holders other than the Company and (ii) holders of Series 1 CPOP Units. \n\nOur Total Portfolio acquisition expenses decreased by $0.1 million, or 46.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\n \u2022 Maintaining a ratio of total indebtedness to total asset value of not more than 60%; \nAdditionally, subject to the terms of the Senior Notes, upon certain events of default, including, but not limited to, (i) a default in the payment of any principal, make-whole payment amount, or interest under the Senior Notes, (ii) a default in the payment of certain of our other indebtedness, (iii) a default in compliance with the covenants set forth in the Senior Notes agreement and (iv) bankruptcy and other insolvency defaults, the principal and accrued and unpaid interest and the make-whole payment amount on the outstanding Senior Notes will become due and payable at the option of the purchasers. In addition, we are required to maintain at all times a credit rating on the Senior Notes from either S&P, Moody's or Fitch. As noted above, most recently in November 2019, Fitch affirmed the investment grade rating of the Senior Notes at BBB with a stable outlook.\nmillion of insurance and real estate tax expense during the year ended December 31, 2019, related to our repositioning and redevelopment projects.\n \u2022 In February 2020, we amended our senior unsecured credit facility to, among other changes, increase the aggregate commitment for our unsecured revolving credit facility to $500 million from $350 million and to extend the maturity date of the unsecured revolving credit facility to February 2024 from February 2021. \n(2) Tenant Reimbursements\nOur consolidated results of operations are often not comparable from period to period due to the effect of property acquisitions and dispositions completed during the comparative reporting periods. Our Total Portfolio\u201d represents all of the properties owned during the reported periods. To eliminate the effect of changes in our Total Portfolio due to acquisitions and dispositions and to highlight the operating results of our on-going business, we have separately presented the results of our Same Properties Portfolio.\u201d\nOur operating results depend primarily upon generating rental revenue from the properties in our consolidated portfolio. The amount of rental revenue generated by these properties is affected by our ability to maintain or increase occupancy levels and rental rates at our properties, which will depend upon our ability to lease vacant space and re-lease expiring space at favorable rates.\n (1) Amount relates to the Company's acquisition of the remaining 85% ownership interest in the property located at 3233 Mission Oaks Boulevard from a prior unconsolidated joint venture. For additional information, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Report on Form 10-K. \nFor the comparison of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our Same Properties Portfolio includes all properties in our industrial portfolio that were wholly-owned by us as of January 1, 2018, and still owned by us as of December 31, 2019, which consisted of 144 properties aggregating approximately 18.1 million rentable square feet. Results for our Same Properties Portfolio exclude any properties that were acquired or sold during 2019 and 2018, interest income, interest expense and corporate general and administrative expenses. For the comparison of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our Total Portfolio includes the properties in our Same Properties Portfolio, the 70 properties aggregating approximately 8.4 million rentable square feet that were acquired during 2019 and 2018, and the nine properties aggregating approximately 0.5 million rentable square feet that were sold during 2019 and 2018.\n \u2022 During 2019, we sold 16,817,930 shares of common stock under our various at-the-market equity offering programs, for gross proceeds of $649.3 million, or approximately $38.61 per share, and net proceeds of $639.6 million after deducting the sales agents' fee. \nIn San Diego, although there was an increase in vacancy year-over-year, net absorption was positive during 2019 and average asking lease rates increased year-over-year.\nNOI on a cash-basis ( Cash NOI\u201d) is a non-GAAP measure, which we calculate by adding or subtracting the following items from NOI: i) fair value lease revenue and ii) straight-line rental revenue adjustments. We use Cash NOI, together with NOI, as a supplemental performance measure. Cash NOI should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. Cash NOI should not be used as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP.\nLastly, in the Inland Empire, new industrial product continues to be absorbed well in the market. In the Inland Empire West, which contains infill markets in which we operate, vacancy remained at historically low levels and asking lease rates increased year-over-year. We expect the outlook for the Inland Empire West to remain positive over the upcoming year. We generally do not focus on properties located within the non-infill Inland Empire East sub-market where available land and the development and construction pipeline for new supply is substantial.\nThe following table sets forth the revenue and expense items comprising NOI and the adjustments to calculate Cash NOI (in thousands):\nAs of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the Amended Revolver, leaving $500.0 million available for future borrowings.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in net cash flows associated with our operating, investing, and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):\nInflation\n (5) The GAAP and cash re-leasing rent spreads for renewal leases executed during the year ended December 31, 2019, exclude five leases aggregating 33,404 rentable square feet for which there was no comparable lease data due to either (i) space with different lease structures or (ii) space with lease terms shorter than six months. \nFuture sales, if any, will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including among others, market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and capital needs. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering of shares under the $550 Million ATM Program, if any, to fund potential acquisition opportunities, repay amounts outstanding from time to time under our unsecured revolving credit facility or other debt financing obligations, to fund our development or redevelopment activities and/or for general corporate purposes.\nWe capitalize direct costs incurred in developing, renovating, rehabilitating and improving real estate assets as part of the investment basis. This includes certain general and administrative costs, including payroll, bonus, and non-cash equity compensation of the personnel performing development, renovations and rehabilitation if such costs are identifiable to a specific activity to get the real estate asset ready for its intended use. During the development and construction periods of a project, we also capitalize interest, real estate taxes and insurance costs. We cease capitalization of costs upon substantial completion of the project, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. If some portions of a project are substantially complete and ready for use and other portions have not yet reached that stage, we cease capitalizing costs on the completed portion of the project but continue to capitalize for the incomplete portion of the project. Costs incurred in making repairs and maintaining real estate assets are expensed as incurred.\nOur Same Properties Portfolio and Total Portfolio rental income increased by $10.9 million, or 5.7%, and $53.6 million, or 25.5%, respectively, during the year ended months ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended months ended December 31, 2018, for the reasons described below:\n (9) As of December 31, 2019, the $150 Million Term Loan Facility has been effectively fixed at 2.7625% plus an applicable LIBOR margin through the use of an interest rate swap with a notional value of $150.0 million and an effective date of July 22, 2019. \nOccupancy Rates\nThe Company's growth strategy comprises acquiring leased, stabilized properties as well as properties with value-add opportunities to improve functionality and to deploy our value-driven asset management programs in order to increase cash flow and value. Additionally, from time to time, we may acquire land parcels or properties with excess land where we may construct new buildings. Acquisitions may comprise single property investments as well as the purchase of portfolios of properties, with transaction values typically ranging from a $10 million minimum property investment to portfolios potentially valued in the billions of dollars. The Company's geographic focus remains infill Southern California. However, from time-to-time, portfolios could be acquired comprising a critical mass of infill Southern California industrial property that could include some assets located in markets outside of infill Southern California. In general, to the extent non-infill-Southern California assets were to be acquired as part of a larger portfolio, the Company may underwrite such investments with the potential to dispose such assets over a certain period of time in order to maximize its core focus on infill Southern California, while endeavoring to take appropriate steps to satisfy REIT safe harbor requirements to avoid prohibited transactions under REIT tax laws.\n\nRefer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations\u201d in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on February 19, 2019, for a discussion of the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOur long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for acquisitions, recurring and non-recurring capital expenditures and scheduled debt maturities. We intend to satisfy our long-term liquidity needs through net cash flow from operations, proceeds from long-term secured and unsecured financings, borrowings available under our unsecured revolving credit facility, the issuance of equity securities, including preferred stock, and proceeds from selective real estate dispositions as we identify capital recycling opportunities.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our consolidated portfolio consisted of 213 properties with approximately 26.6 million rentable square feet. In addition, we currently manage an additional 19 properties with approximately 1.0 million rentable square feet.\nWe determine the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property by valuing the property as if it were vacant. This as-if vacant\u201d value is estimated using an income, or discounted cash flow, approach that relies upon Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable inputs based on the Company's assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use. These Level 3 inputs include discount rates, capitalization rates, market rents and comparable sales data for similar properties. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. In calculating the as-if-vacant\u201d value for acquisitions completed during the year ended December 31, 2019, we used discount rates ranging from 5.75% and 7.75% and capitalization rates ranging from 4.50% to 7.25%.\nThe properties in our portfolio are located primarily in Southern California infill markets. Positive or negative changes in economic or other conditions, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters in this market may affect our overall performance.\nOur Same Properties Portfolio and Total Portfolio rental revenue increased by $9.7 million, or 6.0%, and $44.9 million, or 25.3%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in our Same Properties Portfolio rental revenue is primarily due to the increase in the weighted average occupancy of the portfolio for comparable periods, which was partially driven by the lease-up of the six SPP Stabilized Properties, and the increase in average rental rates on new and renewal leases. Our Total Portfolio rental income was also positively impacted by the incremental revenues from the 70 properties we acquired during 2018 and 2019, partially offset by the decrease in revenues from the nine properties that were sold during 2018 and 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2019, 0.7 million rentable square feet of our portfolio was available for lease, 0.3 million rentable square feet of vacant space was under repositioning and leases representing 0.1 million rentable square feet of our portfolio expired on December 31, 2019. Additionally, leases representing 14.7% and 19.8% of the aggregate rentable square footage of our portfolio are scheduled to expire during the years ending December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we renewed 225 leases for 3.3 million rentable square feet, resulting in a 72.8% retention rate. Our retention rate during the period was impacted by the combination of low vacancy and high demand in many of our key markets. New and renewal leases signed during the current year had a weighted average term of 5.2 and 4.6 years, respectively, and we expect future new and renewal leases to have similar terms.\nThe infill Southern California industrial real estate sector has continued to exhibit strong fundamentals. These high-barrier infill markets are characterized by a relative scarcity of available product, generally operating at near full occupancy, coupled with limited ability to introduce new supply due to high land and development costs and a dearth of developable land in markets experiencing a net reduction in supply as more industrial property is converted to non-industrial uses than can be delivered. Consequently, available industrial supply continues to decrease in many of our target infill submarkets, landlord concessions are at cyclically low levels and construction deliveries are falling short of demand. Meanwhile, underlying tenant demand within our infill target markets continues to demonstrate growth, illustrated or driven by strong re-leasing spreads, strong renewal activity, an expanding regional economy, substantial growth in e-commerce transaction and delivery volumes, as well as further compression of delivery time-frames to consumers and to businesses, increasing the significance of last-mile facilities for timely fulfillment. Despite potential concerns related to global growth, tax reform and changes to trade and tariff policies, we continue to observe a number of positive trends within our target infill markets. Based on current observations within the infill Southern California industrial property market and within our property portfolio, we expect these positive trends may continue into the upcoming year.\nMinimum annual lease payments are recognized in rental income on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease, regardless of when payments are contractually due. Rental revenue recognition commences when the tenant takes possession or controls the physical use of the leased space. Lease termination fees, which are included in rental income, are recognized when the related leases are canceled and we have no continuing obligation to provide services to such former tenants.\nFor asset acquisitions, we allocate the cost of the acquisition, which includes the purchase price and associated acquisition transaction costs, to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis. These individual assets and liabilities typically include land, building and improvements, tenant improvements, intangible assets and liabilities related to above- and below-market leases, intangible assets related to in-place leases, and from time to time, assumed debt. As there is no measurement period concept for an asset acquisition, the allocated cost of the acquired assets is finalized in the period in which the acquisition occurs.\n (5) Two additional six-month extensions are available at the borrower's option, subject to certain terms and conditions. \n \u2022 Maintaining a Debt Service Coverage Ratio (as defined in the term loan agreement) of at least 1.10 to 1.00, to be tested quarterly; \nGain or Loss on Sale of Real Estate\nAs of December 31, 2019, our cash and cash equivalents were $78.9 million, and we did not have any borrowings outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility, leaving $350.0 million available for future borrowings.\n (4) The GAAP and cash re-leasing spreads for new leases executed during the year ended December 31, 2019, exclude 56 leases aggregating 1,115,451 rentable square feet for which there was no comparable lease data. Of these 56 excluded leases, 19 leases aggregating 429,087 rentable square feet are leases of recently repositioned space. Comparable leases generally exclude: (i) space that has never been occupied under our ownership, (ii) recently repositioned/redeveloped space, (iii) space that has been vacant for over one year or (iv) space with lease terms shorter than six months. \n (2) Our Same Properties Portfolio\u201d is a subset of our consolidated portfolio and includes all properties that were wholly-owned by us as of January 1, 2018, and still owned by us as of December 31, 2019. A property with a Y\u201d indicates its inclusion in the Same Properties Portfolio and a property with a N\u201d indicates its exclusion from the Same Properties Portfolio. \nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to EBITDAre (in thousands):\nNet operating income ( NOI\u201d) is a non-GAAP measure which includes the revenue and expense directly attributable to our real estate properties. NOI is calculated as rental income less property expenses (before interest expense, depreciation and amortization).\nWe anticipate continuing to selectively and opportunistically dispose of properties, however, the timing of any potential future dispositions will depend on market conditions, asset-specific circumstances or opportunities, and our capital needs. Our ability to dispose of selective properties on advantageous terms, or at all, is dependent upon a number of factors including the availability of credit to potential buyers to purchase properties at prices that we consider acceptable.\n\nScheduled Lease Expirations\nWe account for acquisitions of properties under Accounting Standards Update 2017-01, Business Combinations - Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which provides a framework for determining whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or businesses and further revises the definition of a business.\n (11) Repositioning construction work for 2722 Fairview Street was completed in 4Q-2018. Although the renovated space is still vacant, based on our definition of stabilized in footnote (10) above, 2722 Fairview Street is considered stabilized as of 4Q-2019, one year after the completion of repositioning construction work.  Properties that are nonoperational as a result of repositioning or redevelopment activity may qualify for varying levels of interest, insurance and real estate tax capitalization during the development and construction period. An increase in our repositioning and development activities resulting from value-add acquisitions could cause an increase in the asset balances qualifying for interest, insurance and tax capitalization in future periods. We capitalized $3.9 million of interest expense and $1.3\nThe $60 Million Term Loan contains the following financial covenants:\n\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we completed the sale of three properties and one industrial condominium unit for a total gross sales price of $33.6 million and total net cash proceeds of $32.3 million. The net cash proceeds were used to partially fund the acquisition of three properties during the year ended December 31, 2019, through 1031 Exchange transactions.\nHowever, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. Other equity REITs may not calculate or interpret FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as we do, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity and is not indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends.\nManagement, leasing and development services\n \u2022 As of December 31, 2019, we have leased 42,504 rentable square feet at 2455 Conejo Spectrum Street, 51,925 rentable square feet at 16121 Carmenita Road and our 72,250 rentable square foot building located at 635 8th Street, of which 47,048 rentable square feet is pre-leased with lease commencement expected to occur in March 2020.  Dispositions\nRecoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. To review real estate assets for recoverability, we consider current market conditions as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. The intent with regard to the underlying assets might change as market conditions and other factors change. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, applying a capitalization rate to estimated net operating income of a property, quoted market values and third party appraisals, where considered necessary. The use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan used to manage our underlying business. If our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we will recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the real estate property.\n (4) As of December 31, 2019, one unit with 25,202 rentable square foot unit is occupied and the remaining two units with a combined 47,048 rentable square feet have been pre-leased with lease commencement expected to occur in March 2020. \n \u2022 For the Amended Credit Agreement, $225 Million Term Loan Facility and $150 Million Term Loan Facility, maintaining a minimum tangible net worth of at least the sum of (i) $2,061,865,500, and (ii) an amount equal to at least 75% of the net equity proceeds received by the Company after September 30, 2019; \n \u2022 During 2019 we completed the lease-up and stabilized five of our repositioning properties located at 1998 Surveyor Avenue, 14748-14750 Nelson Avenue, 15401 Figueroa Street, 1332-1340 Rocky Point and 1580 Carson Street with a combined 0.4 million square feet, as well as 109,129 rentable square feet of space at 3233 Mission Oaks Boulevard. \n (1) The estimated construction period is subject to change as a result of a number of factors including but not limited to permit requirements, delays in construction, changes in scope, and other unforeseen circumstances. \n (2) Reflects an estimate of interest payments due on variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps. For variable rate debt where interest is paid based on LIBOR plus an applicable LIBOR margin, we used the applicable LIBOR margin in effect as of December 31, 2019, and the one-month LIBOR rate of 1.7625%, as of December 31, 2019. Furthermore, it is assumed that any maturity extension options available are not exercised. \nConditions in Our Markets\n \u2022 In July 2019, we completed a private placement of $100.0 million of senior notes comprised of $25.0 million of 10-year senior notes at a fixed rate of 3.88% and $75.0 million of 15-year senior notes at a fixed rate of 4.03%. \nlosses, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures.\nInterest Income\nIn order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we are required to distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains. To satisfy the requirements to qualify as a REIT and generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax, we intend to distribute a percentage of our cash flow on a quarterly basis to holders of our common stock. In addition, we intend to make distribution payments to holders of OP Units and dividend payments to holders of our preferred stock.\nUses of Liquidity\n2013 and Rexford Industrial Realty, L.P. (the Operating Partnership\u201d), of which we are the sole general partner, was formed as a Maryland limited partnership on January 18, 2013. Through our controlling interest in our Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, we own, manage, lease, acquire and develop industrial real estate primarily located in Southern California infill markets, and from time to time, acquire or provide mortgage debt secured by industrial property. We are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a REIT under the Code, and generally are not subject to federal taxes on our income to the extent we distribute our income to our shareholders and maintain our qualification as a REIT.\nCash Flow from Operations\nAmended Credit Agreement\nOur Same Properties Portfolio and Total Portfolio property expenses increased by $1.8 million, or 3.9%, and $11.6 million, or 22.5%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in our Same Properties Portfolio property expenses is primarily due to an increase in real estate tax expense relating to\n \u2022 In April 2019, in connection with the acquisition of the property located at 1515 East 15th Street, we issued to the seller 593,960 newly issued 4.43937% Cumulative Redeemable Convertible Preferred Units of partnership interest in the Operating Partnership ( Series 1 CPOP Units\u201d) valued at $27.4 million. \nOn June 13, 2019, we established a new at-the-market equity offering program (the $550 Million ATM Program\u201d) pursuant to which we may sell from time to time up to an aggregate of $550.0 million of our common stock through sales agents. The $550 Million ATM Program replaces our previous $450.0 million at-the-market equity offering program which was established on February 19, 2019 (the Prior ATM Program\u201d). Substantially all $450.0 million of shares of our common stock available under the Prior ATM Program were sold prior to establishing the $550 Million ATM Program.\nResults of Operations\nNote Purchase and Guarantee Agreement\nThe following table sets forth our principal obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2019, including (i) scheduled principal payments and debt maturities, (ii) periodic interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness and interest rate swaps, (iii) office lease payments and (iv) other contractual obligations (in thousands):\nGain on Sale of Real Estate\n (3) See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding leases. As of December 31, 2019, we have additional operating leases for office space that have not yet commenced of $3.4 million which has been included above. \nA repositioning can consist of a range of improvements to a property. This may include a complete structural renovation of a property whereby we convert large underutilized spaces into a series of smaller and more functional spaces, or it may include the creation of additional square footage, the modernization of the building and property site, the elimination of functional obsolescence, the addition or enhancement of loading areas and truck access, the enhancement of fire-life-safety systems or other accretive improvements. Because each repositioning effort is unique and determined based on the property, targeted tenants and overall trends in the general market and specific submarket, the timing and effect of the repositioning on our rental revenue and occupancy levels will vary, and, as a result, will affect the comparison of our results of operations from period to period with limited predictability.\nOur goal is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders by providing superior access to industrial property investments and mortgage debt secured by industrial property in high barrier Southern California infill markets. Our target markets provide us with opportunities to acquire both stabilized properties generating favorable cash flow, as well as properties or land parcels where we can enhance returns through value-add renovations and redevelopment or the development of new industrial buildings. Scarcity of available space and high barriers limiting new construction of for-lease product all contribute to create superior long-term supply/demand fundamentals within our target infill Southern California industrial property markets. With our vertically integrated operating platform and extensive value-add investment and management capabilities, we believe we are positioned to capitalize upon the opportunities in our markets to achieve our objectives.\nInvestment Grade Rating\nProperty Expenses\n\nWe calculate funds from operations ( FFO\u201d) attributable to common stockholders in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d). FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, impairment\nThe following table sets forth certain information with respect to our consolidated indebtedness outstanding as of December 31, 2019:", "item_7_text": " \u2022 For the $100 Million Notes, $125 Million Notes and Series 2019A and 2019B Notes (together the Senior Notes\u201d), maintaining a ratio of secured debt to total asset value of not more than 40%; \n \u2022 Maintaining a ratio of adjusted EBITDA (as defined in each of the loan agreements) to fixed charges of at least 1.50 to 1.0; \n (3) Calculated as the change between starting cash rents, excluding any abatements, for new or renewal leases and the expiring cash rents on the expiring leases for the same space. \nNon-GAAP Supplemental Measures: NOI and Cash NOI\nHighlights\nWe evaluate the capital markets on an ongoing basis for opportunities to raise capital, and as circumstances warrant, we may issue additional securities, from time to time, to fund acquisitions, for the repayment of long-term debt upon maturity and for other general corporate purposes. Any future issuance, however, is dependent upon market conditions, available pricing and capital needs and there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such offerings of securities.\nNet cash provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $36.7 million to $139.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $102.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to incremental cash flows from property acquisitions completed subsequent to January 1, 2018, the increase in Cash NOI from our Same Properties Portfolio, changes in working capital and lower cash interest paid during 2019.\n \u2022 For the Senior Notes, maintaining a ratio of total secured recourse debt to total asset value of not more than 15%; \n (2) Calculated as the change between GAAP rents, which straightlines rental rate increases and abatements, for new or renewal leases and the expiring GAAP rents on the expiring leases for the same space. \nInterest Expense\nLeasing commissions are earned when we provide leasing services to the customer that result in an executed lease with a tenant. We have determined that control over the services is transferred to the customer upon execution of each lease agreement. We earn leasing commissions based on a fixed percentage of rental income generated for each executed lease agreement and there is no variable income component.\nThe leases scheduled to expire during the years ending December 31, 2020 and 2021, represent 14.9% and 19.4%, respectively, of the total annualized base rent for our portfolio as of December 31, 2019. We estimate that, on a weighted average basis, in-place rents of leases scheduled to expire in 2020 and 2021 are currently below current market asking rates, although individual units or properties within any particular submarket may currently be leased either above, below, or at the current market asking rates within that submarket. As described in the above Market Fundamentals section, we expect market dynamics to remain strong heading into 2020 and that these positive trends will provide a favorable environment for additional increases in lease renewal rates. Accordingly, we expect 2020 will show positive renewal rates and leasing spreads. We also currently do not see any reason not to expect that 2021 lease expirations will show positive growth upon renewal; however, it is difficult to predict market conditions that far into the future.\n (7) We acquired Conejo Spectrum Business Park, a nine-building property during the first quarter of 2019. Information presented in this table relates to one of the nine buildings, located at 2455 Conejo Spectrum Street. \n (1) Includes the effect of interest rate swaps that were effective as of December 31, 2019. Excludes the effect of amortization of debt issuance costs, discounts and the facility fee on the Revolver. Assumes a one-month LIBOR rate of 1.7625% as of December 31, 2019, as applicable. \nOn January 1, 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases ( ASC 842\u201d) using the modified retrospective approach and elected the non-separation practical expedient\u201d in ASC 842 that alleviates the requirement to separately present lease and non-lease components of lease contracts if certain criteria are met. As a result, we account for and present all rental income earned pursuant to tenant leases, including tenant reimbursements, as a single component in one line, Rental income,\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations. Prior to the adoption ASC 842, we presented rental revenue, tenant reimbursements and other income related to leases separately in our consolidated statements of operations. However, to facilitate comparability, we have reclassified 2018 amounts to conform with 2019 presentation. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 of this Report on Form 10-K for disclosure related to the adoption of ASC 842.\nAs of December 31, 2019, eight of our properties were in various stages of repositioning or development and three of our properties were in the lease-up stage. In addition, we anticipate beginning repositioning/redevelopment work on three additional properties in the near future. The table below sets forth a summary of these properties, as well as the seven projects that were stabilized during 2019 and the four properties that were stabilized during 2018, as the timing of these stabilizations have a direct impact on our current and comparative results of operations. In addition to the properties in the table below, we also have a range of smaller spaces in value-add repositioning or renovation, that due to their smaller size and relatively nominal amount of down-time, are not presented below, however, in the aggregate, may be substantial.\n (5) The Merge is a fully entitled industrial development site on which we plan to build six industrial buildings totaling 333,491 rentable square feet. \n \u2022 For the Senior Notes, maintaining a minimum tangible net worth of at least the sum of (i) $760,740,750, and (ii) an amount equal to at least 75% of the net equity proceeds received by the Company after September 30, 2016; \nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2018 to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nAcquisitions\n \u2022 Maintaining a minimum Fair Market Net Worth (as defined in the term loan agreement) of at least $75 million, to be tested annually as of December 31 of each year.  We were in compliance with all of our quarterly and annual debt covenants as of December 31, 2019.\nThe difference between the fair value and the face value of debt assumed in connection with an acquisition is recorded as a premium or discount and amortized to interest expense\u201d over the life of the debt assumed. The valuation of assumed liabilities is based on our estimate of the current market rates for similar liabilities in effect at the acquisition date.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled Risk Factors,\u201d Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Business\u201d and our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe may be subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that could affect the collection of outstanding receivables related to our operating leases. In order to mitigate these risks, we perform credit reviews and analyses on prospective tenants before significant leases are executed and on existing tenants before properties are acquired. On a quarterly basis, we perform an assessment of the collectability of operating lease receivables on a tenant-by-tenant basis, which includes reviewing the age and nature of our receivables, the payment history and financial condition of the tenant, our assessment of the tenant's ability to meet its lease obligations and the status of negotiations of any disputes with the tenant. Any changes in the collectability assessment for an operating lease is recognized as an adjustment, which can be a reduction or increase, to rental income in the consolidated statements of operations. As a result of our quarterly collectability assessments, we recognized $0.7 million and $1.2 million, $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively, as a reduction of rental income in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Amended Revolver and the Amended Term Loan Facility may be voluntarily prepaid in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty. Amounts borrowed under the Amended Term Loan Facility and repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed.\n (2) Excludes unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discounts totaling $3.1 million as of December 31, 2019.  At December 31, 2019, we had total indebtedness of $861.0 million, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discounts, with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.54% and an average term-to-maturity of 5.5 years. As of December 31, 2019, $802.5 million, or 93%, of our outstanding indebtedness had an interest rate that was effectively fixed under either the terms of the loan ($327.5 million) or an interest rate swap ($475.0 million).\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for the reporting periods. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates and assumptions. We have summarized below those accounting policies that require material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on financial condition and results of operations. Management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis, based upon information currently available and on various assumptions that it believes are reasonable as of the date hereof. In addition, other companies in similar businesses may use different estimation policies and methodologies, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations and financial condition to those of other companies.\nIn addition to the interest payable on amounts outstanding under the Amended Revolver, we are required to pay an applicable facility fee, based upon our leverage ratio, on the aggregate amount of each lender's Revolving Credit Commitment (whether or not such Revolving Credit Commitment is drawn), as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement. The applicable facility fee will range in amount from 0.15% to 0.30% per annum, depending on our leverage ratio. In the event that we convert the pricing structure to be based on an investment-grade rating, the applicable facility fee will range in amount from 0.125% to 0.30% per annum, depending on such rating.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to NOI and Cash NOI (in thousands):\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2019 to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nOn February 10, 2020, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.215 per share of common stock and a quarterly cash distribution of $0.215 per OP Unit, to be paid on April 15, 2020, to holders of record as of March 31, 2020. Also, on February 10, 2020, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.367188 per share of our 5.875% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, a quarterly cash dividend of $0.367188 per share of our 5.875% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, a quarterly cash dividend of $0.351563 per share of our Series C Preferred Stock and a quarterly cash distribution of $0.505085 per Series 1 CPOP Unit to be paid on March 31, 2020, to holders of record as of March 13, 2020.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2019 to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nThe Amended Credit Agreement is guaranteed by the Company and by substantially all of the current and to-be-formed subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership that own an unencumbered property. The Amended Credit Agreement is not secured by the Company's properties or by equity interests in the subsidiaries that hold such properties.\nFactors That May Influence Future Results of Operations\n (1) Amount relates to the Company's acquisition of the remaining 85% ownership interest in the property located at 3233 Mission Oaks Boulevard from a prior unconsolidated joint venture. For additional information, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Report on Form 10-K. \n \u2022 Maintaining a ratio of total unsecured debt to total unencumbered asset value of not more than 60%; \n (7) As of December 31, 2019, the $100 Million Term Loan Facility has been effectively fixed at 1.764% plus an applicable LIBOR margin through the use of an interest rate swap with a notional value of $100.0 million and an effective date of December 14, 2018. \nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nRexford Industrial Realty, Inc. is a self-administered and self-managed full-service REIT focused on owning and operating industrial properties in Southern California infill markets. We were formed as a Maryland corporation on January 18,\nIf we attain one additional investment grade rating by one or more of Standard & Poor's ( S&P\u201d) or Moody's Investor Services ( Moody's\u201d) to complement our current investment grade Fitch rating, we may elect to convert the pricing structure under the Amended Credit Agreement to be based on such rating. In that event, the margins for the Amended Revolver will range in amount from 0.725% to 1.40% per annum for LIBOR-based loans and 0.00% to 0.45% per annum for Base Rate-based loans, depending on such rating, and the margins for the Amended Term Loan Facility will range in amount from 0.85% to 1.65% per annum for LIBOR-based loans and 0.00% to 0.65% per annum for Base Rate-based loans, depending on such rating.\n (3) Participating securities include unvested shares of restricted stock, unvested LTIP units of partnership interest in our Operating Partnership and unvested performance units in our Operating Partnership. \n (8) 9615 Norwalk Boulevard is a 10.26 acre storage-yard with three buildings totaling 38,362 rentable square feet. In January 2019, we converted the tenant's month to month land lease to a term lease with an expiration date of June 30, 2020. We will demolish the existing buildings and construct a new 201,808 rentable square foot building upon termination of the land lease. \nAs of December 31, 2019, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nOur operating results depend upon the infill Southern California industrial real estate market.\nCalifornia Proposition 13 annual increases and property reassessments, lower capitalized real estate tax expense due to completed repositioning activity, as well as increases in allocated overhead costs and insurance expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in real estate tax expense due to the adoption of ASC 842 and the change in reporting for real estate taxes that are paid directly by a lessee to a third party from a gross basis to a net basis at three of our properties. Our Total Portfolio property expenses were also impacted by incremental expenses from the 70 properties we acquired during 2018 and 2019, partially offset by the decrease in property expenses from the nine properties that were sold during 2018 and 2019.\nOur Same Properties Portfolio and Total Portfolio other income increased by $0.4 million, or 45.9%, and $0.5 million, or 58.8%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase in miscellaneous income.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold a total of 16,817,930 shares of our common stock under the $550 Million ATM Program and the Prior ATM Program at a weighted average price of $38.61 per share, for gross proceeds of $649.3 million, and net proceeds of $639.6 million, after deducting the sales agents' fee. As of December 31, 2019, we had the capacity to issue up to an additional $350.7 million of common stock under the $550 Million ATM Program.\nCash Flows\n\nValuation of Receivables\nRevenue Recognition\nOn February 13, 2020, we amended our $450 million credit facility (the Prior Credit Agreement\u201d) by entering into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Amended Credit Agreement\u201d), which provides for a $600.0 million senior unsecured credit facility, comprised of a $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the \"Amended Revolver\") and a $100.0 million unsecured term loan facility (the \"Amended Term Loan Facility\"). The Amended Revolver is scheduled to mature on February 13, 2024, and has two six-month extension options available for a maximum maturity date of February 13, 2025, subject to certain conditions and the payment of an additional fee. The Amended Term Loan Facility is scheduled to mature on February 14, 2022. Subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement, we may request additional lender commitments up to an additional aggregate $900.0 million, which may be comprised of additional revolving commitments under the Amended Revolver, an increase to the Amended Term Loan Facility, additional term loan tranches or any combination of the foregoing.\nOur Total Portfolio interest expense increased by $1.5 million, or 5.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in interest expense is primarily comprised of the following: (i) a $2.3 million increase related to the $150.0 million term loan facility borrowing that we completed in May 2018, (ii) a $1.8 million increase related to the private placement of $100.0 million of senior notes that we completed in July 2019 and (iii) a $0.5 million increase related to the $150 million swap that became effective in July 2019. These increases were partially offset by (i) a $1.8 million increase in capitalized interest related to our repositioning and redevelopment properties and (ii) a $1.1 million decrease in interest related to lower average outstanding borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility.\n\nOur ability to re-lease space subject to expiring leases is affected by economic and competitive conditions in our markets and by the desirability of our individual properties, which may impact our results of operations.\n \u2022 For the Amended Credit Agreement, $225 Million Term Loan Facility and $150 Million Term Loan Facility, maintaining a ratio of secured debt to total asset value of not more than 45%; \n(1) Rental Revenue\n \u2022 In September 2019, we completed a public offering of 3,450,000 shares of our 5.625% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at a price of $25.00 per share, for net proceeds of approximately $83.2 million after deducting the underwriters' discount and offering costs.  Financing\nDebt Covenants\nand (iii) an increase of $22.4 million in dividends and distributions paid to common stockholders and common unitholders resulting from the increase in the number of common shares outstanding and the increase in our quarterly per share cash dividend.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement, $225 Million Term Loan Facility, $150 Million Term Loan Facility, $100 Million Notes, $125 Million Notes and Series 2019A and 2019B Notes all include a series of financial and other covenants that we must comply with, including the following covenants which are tested on a quarterly basis:\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nAssumptions and estimates used in the recoverability analyses for future cash flows, discount rates and capitalization rates are complex and subjective. Changes in economic and operating conditions or our intent with respect to our investment that occur subsequent to our impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment of our real estate properties.\nManagement, Leasing and Development Services\nThe following tables set forth our leasing activity for new and renewal leases on a quarterly basis for the year ended December 31, 2019:\nCapital expenditures are considered part of both our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred $6.8 million of recurring capital expenditures, which was an increase of $1.2 million over the prior year. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred $34.1 million of non-recurring capital expenditures, which was a decrease of $11.3 million over the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to the decrease in non-recurring capital expenditures related to redevelopment activity during 2019 compared to 2018. As discussed above under -Factors that May Influence Future Results -Acquisitions and Value-Add Repositioning and Development of Properties, as of December 31, 2019, 11 of our properties were in various stages of redevelopment and repositioning or lease-up, and we anticipate beginning repositioning work on three additional properties during 2020 and 2021. We currently estimate that approximately $110.6 million of capital will be required over the next eight quarters (1Q-2020 through 4Q-2021) to complete the redevelopment and repositioning of these properties. However, this estimate is based on our current construction plan and budgets, both of which are subject to change as a result of a number of factors. If we are unable to complete construction on schedule or within budget, we could incur increased construction costs and experience potential delays in leasing the properties. We expect to fund these projects through a combination of cash flow from operations, the issuance of common stock under the $550 Million ATM Program and borrowings available under the Amended Revolver.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had total indebtedness of $861.0 million, reflecting a net debt to total combined market capitalization of approximately 12.3%. Our total market capitalization is defined as the sum of the liquidation preference of our outstanding preferred stock and preferred units plus the market value of our common stock excluding shares of nonvested restricted stock, plus the aggregate value of common units not owned by us, plus the value of our net debt. Our net debt is defined as our consolidated indebtedness less cash and cash equivalents.\nRental Income\nATM Program\n (6) Includes two leases totaling 132,650 rentable square feet that expired during the year ended December 31, 2019, for which the space was placed into repositioning after each tenant vacated. \nThe following critical accounting policies discussion reflects what we believe are the most significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. For further discussion of our significant accounting policies and discussion of new accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 of this report on Form 10-K.\nIn determining the fair value of intangible lease assets or liabilities, we also consider Level 3 inputs. Acquired above- and below-market leases are valued based on the present value of the difference between prevailing market rates and the in-place rates measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases, if applicable. The estimated fair value of acquired in-place at-market tenant leases are the costs that would have been incurred to lease the property to the occupancy level of the property at the date of acquisition. Such estimates include the value associated with leasing commissions, legal and other costs, as well as the estimated period necessary to lease such property to its occupancy level at the time of its acquisition. In determining the fair value of acquisitions completed during the year ended December 31, 2019, we used an estimated average lease-up period ranging from six to twelve months.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2019, our consolidated portfolio, inclusive of space in repositioning as described in the subsequent paragraph, was approximately 96.1% occupied, while our stabilized consolidated portfolio exclusive of such space was approximately 97.9% occupied. We believe the opportunity to increase occupancy at our properties will be an important driver of future revenue growth. An opportunity to drive this growth will derive from the lease-up of recently completed repositioning projects and the completion and lease-up of repositioning and development projects that are currently under construction and planned for near-term construction.\nOne of our most significant liquidity needs has historically been for the acquisition of real estate properties. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we acquired 40 properties with a combined 5.4 million rentable square feet for a total gross purchase price of $970.7 million, and we are actively monitoring a volume of properties in our markets that we believe represent attractive potential investment opportunities to continue to grow our business. As of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have approximately $268.4 million of acquisitions under contract or letter of intent. There can be no assurance we will complete any such acquisitions. While the actual number of acquisitions that we complete will be dependent upon a number of factors, in the short term, we expect to fund our acquisitions through available cash on hand, cash flows from operations, borrowings available under the Amended Revolver, recycling capital through property dispositions and, in the long term, through the issuance of equity securities or proceeds from long-term secured and unsecured financings.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur primary sources of revenue are rental income, management, leasing and development services and gains on sale of real estate.\nOn September 20, 2019, we completed an underwritten public offering of 3,450,000 shares of our 5.625% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the Series C Preferred Stock\u201d), including 450,000 additional shares of Series C Preferred Stock pursuant to an option to purchase additional shares solely to cover over-allotments, at a price of $25.00 per share. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $83.2 million after deducting the underwriters' discount and offering costs totaling $3.0 million. We used the net proceeds from the offering to fund various acquisitions and for general corporate purposes.\nNon-GAAP Supplemental Measure: EBITDAre\nRefer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Cash Flows\u201d in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on February 19, 2019, for a discussion of the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\nOur property expenses generally consist of utilities, real estate taxes, insurance, site repair and maintenance costs, and the allocation of overhead costs. For the majority of our properties, our property expenses are recovered, in part, by either the triple net provisions or modified gross expense reimbursements in tenant leases. The majority of our leases also comprise contractual three percent annual rental rate increases meant, in part, to help mitigate potential increases in property expenses over time. However, the terms of our leases vary and, in some instances, we may absorb property expenses. Our overall financial results will be impacted by the extent to which we are able to pass-through property expenses to our tenants.\n \u2022 Maintaining a ratio of unencumbered NOI (as defined in each of the loan agreements) to unsecured interest expense of at least 1.75 to 1.0.  The Amended Credit Agreement, $225 Million Term Loan Facility, $150 Million Term Loan Facility and Senior Notes also contain limitations on our ability to pay distributions on our common stock. Specifically, our cash dividends may not exceed the greater of (1) 95% of our FFO (as defined in the credit agreement) and (2) the amount required for us to qualify and maintain our REIT status. If an event of default exists, we may only make distributions sufficient to qualify and maintain our REIT status.\nAcquisitions and Value-Add Repositioning and Development of Properties\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe believe that EBITDAre is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of our operating performance as a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of our properties. We also use this measure in ratios to compare our performance to that of our industry peers. In addition, we believe EBITDAre is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of equity REITs. However, our industry peers may not calculate EBITDAre in accordance with the NAREIT definition as we do and, accordingly, our EBITDAre may not be comparable to our peers' EBITDAre. Accordingly, EBITDAre should be considered only as a supplement to net income (loss) as a measure of our performance.\nGeneral and Administrative\n \u2022 During 2019, we sold three properties and one industrial condominium unit with a combined 0.2 million rentable square feet, for a total gross sales price of $33.6 million, and total net cash proceeds of $32.3 million.  Equity\n (3) We expect to demolish the existing 49,976 rentable square foot building and construct a new 90,856 rentable square foot multi-unit building. \n(3) Other Income\nNet cash provided by financing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities increased by $153.3 million to $731.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $578.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to the following: (i) a decrease of $276.0 million in paydowns on the Revolver, (ii) an increase of $100.0 million in cash proceeds from the issuance of the Series 2019A and 2019B Notes in July 2019, (iii) an increase of $83.2 million in net cash proceeds from the issuance of the Series C Preferred Stock and (iv) an increase of $82.4 million in net cash proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock. These increases were partially offset by the following: (i) a decrease of $216.0 million in draws on the Revolver, (ii) a decrease of $150.0 million in borrowings on the $150 Million Term Loan Facility\nOur Total Portfolio management, leasing and development services revenue decreased by $0.1 million, or 14.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\n (9) We expect to demolish the existing 70,510 rentable square foot building and construct a new 128,350 rentable square foot building. \n (10) We consider a repositioning property to be stabilized upon the earlier of (i) reaching 90% occupancy or (ii) one year from the date construction work is completed. \nThe following table reports the breakdown of 2019 rental income, as reported prior to the adoption of ASC 842, and compares this breakdown with 2018 amounts for the comparable period (dollars in thousands). We believe that the below presentation of rental income is not, and is not intended to be, a presentation in accordance with GAAP. We are presenting this information because we believe it is frequently used by management, investors, securities analysts and other interested parties to evaluate the Company's performance.\nWe evaluated the acquisitions that we completed during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, and determined that under this framework these transactions should be accounted for as asset acquisitions. Our acquisitions of properties generally no longer meet the revised definition of a business and accordingly are accounted for as asset acquisitions.\nwith all accrued unpaid interest and other amounts owing in respect thereof, may be declared immediately due and payable.\n (8) As of December 31, 2019, the $225 Million Term Loan Facility has been effectively fixed at 1.374% plus the applicable LIBOR margin through the use of two interest rate swaps as follows: (i) $125 million with a strike rate of 1.349% and an effective date of February 14, 2018, and (ii) $100 million with a strike rate of 1.406% and an effective date of August 14, 2018, plus the applicable LIBOR margin. \nOn July 16, 2019, we entered into a Note Purchase and Guarantee Agreement (the NPGA\u201d) which provides for the private placement of $100.0 million of guaranteed senior notes, of which (i) $25.0 million are designated as 3.88% Series 2019A Guaranteed Senior Notes due July 16, 2029 (the \"Series 2019A Notes\") and (ii) $75.0 million are designated as 4.03% Series 2019B Guaranteed Senior Notes due July 16, 2034 (the \"Series 2019 B Notes\" and, together with the Series 2019A Notes, the \"Series 2019A and 2019B Notes\"). Interest on the Series 2019A and 2019B Notes will be payable semiannually on the sixteenth day of January and July in each year, beginning on January 16, 2020, until maturity. On July 16, 2019, we completed the issuance of the Series 2019A and 2019B Notes. We used the net proceeds from this issuance to fund the acquisition of industrial properties and for general corporate purposes.\nCompany Overview\nInterest on the Amended Credit Agreement is generally to be paid based upon, at our option, either (i) LIBOR plus an applicable margin that is based upon our leverage ratio or (ii) the Base Rate (which is defined as the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the administrative agent's prime rate or (c) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.00%) plus an applicable margin that is based on our leverage ratio. The margins for the Amended Revolver range in amount from 1.05% to 1.50% per annum for LIBOR-based loans and 0.05% to 0.50% per annum for Base Rate-based loans, depending on our leverage ratio. The margins for the Amended Term Loan Facility range in amount from 1.20% to 1.70% per annum for LIBOR-based loans and 0.20% to 0.70% per annum for Base Rate-based loans, depending on our leverage ratio.\n (6) The LIBOR margin will range from 1.10% to 1.50% per annum for the Revolver, 1.20% to 1.70% per annum for our $100 million term loan facility (the $100 Million Term Loan Facility\u201d), 1.20% to 1.70% per annum for the $225 Million Term Loan Facility and 1.50% to 2.20% per annum for the $150 Million Term Loan Facility, depending on our leverage ratio, which is the ratio of our outstanding consolidated indebtedness to the value of our consolidated gross asset value. This leverage ratio is measured on a quarterly basis, and as a result, the effective interest rate will fluctuate from period to period. \nIn Ventura County, there was a slight increase in vacancy year-over-year and a slight increase in asking lease rates year-over year.\n (6) We expect to demolish the existing 63,900 rentable square foot building and construct a new 96,950 rentable square foot building. \n (2) Excludes unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts totaling $3.1 million as of December 31, 2019. \nA critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity's financial condition and results of operations and requires judgment on the part of management. Generally, the judgment requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates are prepared using management's best judgment, after considering past and current economic conditions and expectations for the future. Changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by the users of our financial statements in their evaluation of our performance.\n (1) Reflects scheduled interest payments on our fixed rate debt, including the $100 Million Notes, $125 Million Notes, Series 2019A and 2019B Notes and the Gilbert/La Palma mortgage loan. \nWe provide property management services and leasing services to related party and third-party property owners (the customer\u201d) in exchange for fees and commissions.\n\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2018 to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nAcquisitions\nIn November 2019, Fitch Ratings affirmed our investment grade credit rating of BBB with a stable outlook on the Prior Credit Agreement, our $225 million unsecured term loan facility (the $225 Million Term Loan Facility\u201d), our $150 million unsecured term loan facility (the $150 Million Term Loan Facility\u201d), our $100 million unsecured guaranteed senior notes (the $100 Million Notes\u201d), our $125 million unsecured guaranteed senior notes (the $125 Million Notes\u201d) and the Series 2019A and 2019B Notes. They also affirmed our investment grade credit rating of BB+ on our 5.875% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, our 5.875% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and our Series C Preferred Stock. Our credit ratings are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analysis of us, and, although it is our intent to maintain our investment grade credit rating, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings. In the event our current credit ratings are downgraded, it may become difficult or more expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing indebtedness as maturities become due.\nRecurring and Nonrecurring Capital Expenditures\nWe calculate earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization for real estate ( EBITDAre\u201d) in accordance with the standards established by NAREIT. EBITDAre is calculated as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, impairment losses and adjustments to reflect our proportionate share of EBITDAre from our prior unconsolidated joint venture.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement contains usual and customary events of default including defaults in the payment of principal, interest or fees, defaults in compliance with the covenants set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement and other loan documentation, cross-defaults to certain other indebtedness, and bankruptcy and other insolvency defaults. If an event of default occurs and is continuing under the Amended Credit Agreement, the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding loans, together\nInvestment in Real Estate\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized a total gain on sale of real estate of $16.3 million from the disposition of three properties and one industrial condominium unit that were sold for an aggregate gross sales price of $33.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized a total gain on sale of real estate of $17.2 million from the disposition of six properties that were sold for an aggregate gross sales price of $48.0 million.\n\n (4) Includes total commitments for tenant improvement and construction work related to obligations under certain tenant leases and vendor contracts. We anticipate these obligations to be paid as incurred in 2020 and 2021, however, as the timing of these obligations is subject to a number of factors, for purposes of this table, we have included the full amount under Less than 1 Year (2020).\u201d  Dividends and Distributions\nLeasing Activity and Rental Rates\n (7) Retention is calculated as renewal lease square footage plus relocation/expansion square footage, divided by the square footage of leases expiring during the period. Retention excludes expiring leases associated with space that is placed into repositioning after the tenant vacates.  Our leasing activity is impacted both by our redevelopment and repositioning efforts, as well as by market conditions. While we reposition a property, its space may become unavailable for leasing until completion of our repositioning efforts. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we stabilized 14748-14750 Nelson Avenue, 1998 Surveyor Avenue, 15401 Figueroa Street, 1332-1340 Rocky Point Drive, 1580 Carson Street and 3233 Mission Oaks Boulevard - Unit 3233 with a combined 524,050 rentable square feet. As of December 31, 2019, we have six current repositioning projects and two development projects with estimated construction completion periods ranging from the first quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021. Additionally, we have three properties in the lease-up stage. We expect these properties to have positive impacts on our leasing activity and revenue generation as we complete our value-add repositioning plans and place these properties in service.\n (1) Includes the effect of interest rate swaps that were effective as of December 31, 2019. Assumes a 1-month LIBOR rate of 1.7625% as of December 31, 2019, as applicable. Excludes the effect of amortization of debt issuance costs, discounts and the facility fee on the Revolver. \nManagement uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions, and asset impairments, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of performance used by other REITs, FFO may be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs.\nWe capitalized interest costs of $3.9 million, $2.1 million and $1.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We capitalized real estate taxes and insurance aggregating $1.3 million, $0.9 million and $1.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We capitalized compensation costs for employees who provide construction services of $2.7 million, $2.2 million and $1.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n (4) The Revolver is subject to an applicable facility fee which is calculated as a percentage of the total lenders' commitment amount, regardless of usage. The applicable facility fee will range from 0.15% to 0.30% depending upon our leverage ratio. \nRental Income\nWe use NOI as a supplemental performance measure because, in excluding real estate depreciation and amortization expense, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, gains (or losses) on sale of real estate and other non-operating items, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that NOI will be useful to investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because NOI excludes depreciation and amortization expense and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties (all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our results from operations), the utility of NOI as a measure of our performance is limited. Other equity REITs may not calculate NOI in a similar manner and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to such other REITs' NOI. Accordingly, NOI should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of our performance. NOI should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. NOI should not be used as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities in accordance with GAAP.\nRental Revenue\nWe continuously evaluate opportunities for the potential disposition of properties in our portfolio when we believe such disposition is appropriate in view of our business objectives. In evaluating these opportunities, we consider a variety of criteria including, but not limited to, local market conditions and lease rates, asset type and location, as well as potential uses of proceeds and tax considerations. Tax considerations include entering into tax-deferred like-kind exchanges under Section 1031 of the Code ( 1031 Exchange\u201d), when possible, to defer some or all of the taxable gains, if any, on dispositions.\n\nOur lease agreements with tenants generally contain provisions that require tenants to reimburse us for certain property expenses. Estimated reimbursements from tenants for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and other recoverable operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period that the expenses are incurred. Subsequent to year-end, we perform final reconciliations on a lease-by-lease basis and bill or credit each tenant for any cumulative annual adjustments.\nA key component of our growth strategy is to acquire properties through off-market and lightly marketed transactions that are often operating at below-market occupancy or below-market rent at the time of acquisition or that have near-term lease roll-over or that provide opportunities to add value through functional or physical repositioning and improvements. Through various redevelopment, repositioning, and professional leasing and marketing strategies, we seek to increase the properties' functionality and attractiveness to prospective tenants and, over time, to stabilize the properties at occupancy rates that meet or exceed market rates.\nThe following table summarizes the composition of our consolidated debt between fixed-rate and variable-rate and secured and unsecured debt as of December 31, 2019:\nIn accordance with the provisions of the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets Subsections of ASC Topic 360: Property, Plant, and Equipment, we assess the carrying values of our respective long-lived assets, including goodwill, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable.\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds to pay for operating expenses, interest expense, general and administrative expenses, capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing commissions, and distributions to our common and preferred stockholders and holders of common units of partnership interests in our Operating Partnership ( OP Units\u201d). We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through available cash on hand, cash flow from operations, by drawing on our unsecured revolving credit facility and by issuing shares of common stock pursuant to the at-the-market equity offering program described below.\nAcquisition Expenses\nIn Los Angeles County, positive market trends continued through 2019, as high tenant demand kept vacancy at historically low levels and average asking lease rates increased significantly during 2019. Current market conditions indicate rents are likely to continue their upward trend with potential increases through 2020, as occupancy still remains at near capacity levels and new development is limited by a lack of land availability and an increase in land and development costs.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our Operating Partnership indirectly and wholly owns Rexford Industrial Realty and Management, Inc., which we refer to as the services company. We have elected, together with our services company, to treat our services company as a taxable REIT subsidiary for federal income tax purposes. A taxable REIT subsidiary generally may provide non-customary and other services to our tenants and engage in activities that we may not engage in directly without adversely affecting our qualification as a REIT, provided a taxable REIT subsidiary may not operate or manage a lodging facility or health care facility or provide rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility or health care facility is operated. We may form additional taxable REIT subsidiaries in the future, and our Operating Partnership may contribute some or all of its interests in certain wholly owned subsidiaries or their assets to our services company. Any income earned by our taxable REIT subsidiaries will not be included in our taxable income for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests, except to the extent such income is distributed to us as a dividend, in which case such dividend income will qualify under the 95%, but not the 75%, gross income test. Because a taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to federal income tax, and state and local income tax (where applicable) as a regular corporation, the income earned by our taxable REIT subsidiaries generally will be subject to an additional level of tax as compared to the income earned by our other subsidiaries. Our taxable REIT subsidiary is a C-corporation subject to federal and state income tax. However it has a cumulative unrecognized net operation loss carryforward and therefore there is no income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nProperty management services include performing property inspections, monitoring repairs and maintenance, negotiating vendor contracts, maintaining tenant relations and providing financial and accounting oversight. For these services, we earn monthly management fees, which are based on a fixed percentage of each managed property's monthly tenant cash receipts. We have determined that control over the services is passed to the customer simultaneously as performance occurs. Accordingly, management fee revenue is earned as services are provided to the customer.\nThe occupancy rate of properties not undergoing repositioning is affected by regional and local economic conditions in our Southern California infill markets. Throughout 2019, the Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego county markets continued to show historically low vacancy and positive absorption, resulting from high tenant demand combined with low product availability. Accordingly, our properties in these markets have exhibited a similar trend. We expect general market conditions to remain positive in 2020, and we believe the opportunity to increase occupancy and rental rates at our properties will be an important driver of future revenue growth.\n \u2022 Maintaining Unencumbered Liquid Assets (as defined in the term loan agreement) of not less than (i) $5 million, or (ii) $8 million if we elect to have Line of Credit Availability (as defined in the term loan agreement) included in the calculation, of which $2 million must be cash or cash equivalents, to be tested annually as of December 31 of each year; \nOur Total Portfolio interest income increased by $1.2 million, or 85.4%, during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase in the average cash balance invested in money market accounts.\nEquity Offerings\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our Same Properties Portfolio occupancy was approximately 97.4% and 96.0%, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our Same Properties Portfolio weighted average occupancy was approximately 96.8% and 95.6%, respectively. These occupancy changes were partially driven by the completion of repositioning and development work and subsequent lease-up of space at the following six properties in our Same Properties Portfolio during the period from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019: (i) 14748-14750 Nelson Avenue, (ii) 3233 Mission Oaks Boulevard,\nAs summarized in the table under Acquisitions and Value-Add Repositioning and Development of Properties\u201d above, as of December 31, 2019, eight of our properties that will have a combined 1.1 million rentable square feet at completion are in current repositioning or development, and three properties with 0.2 million rentable square feet are in lease-up. Vacant repositioning space and lease-up space at these 11 properties are concentrated in our Los Angeles, Orange County, Ventura and San Diego markets, and represent 1.9% of our total consolidated portfolio square footage as of December 31, 2019. Including vacant repositioning and lease-up space at these 11 properties, our weighted average occupancy rate as of December 31, 2019, in Los Angeles, Orange County, Ventura and San Diego was 96.9%, 96.3%, 94.6% and 91.4%, respectively. Excluding vacant repositioning and lease-up space at these 11 properties, our weighted average occupancy rate as of December 31, 2019, in these markets was 98.8%, 96.9%, 98.9% and 94.8%, respectively. We believe that an important portion of our long-term future growth will come from the completion of these projects currently under or scheduled for repositioning, as well as through the identification or acquisition of new opportunities for redevelopment and repositioning, whether in our existing portfolio or through new investments, which may vary from period to period subject to market conditions.\nOur Total Portfolio general and administrative expenses increased by $5.1 million, or 20.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase is primarily due to increases in payroll related expenses due to a higher headcount, non-cash equity compensation expense, accrued bonus expense and other various corporate expenses, partially offset by a decrease in legal expense.\nAcquisitions\nTaxable REIT Subsidiary\n\nNon-GAAP Supplemental Measure: Funds From Operations\nOur Same Properties Portfolio depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $0.5 million, or 0.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to acquisition-related tenant improvements and in-place lease intangibles becoming fully depreciated during 2018 and 2019, partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense related to capital improvements placed into service during 2018 and 2019. Our Total Portfolio depreciation and amortization expense increased by $18.8 million, or 23.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to incremental expense from the 70 properties we acquired during 2018 and 2019, and an increase in depreciation expense related to capital improvements, partially offset by the decrease in our Same Properties Portfolio depreciation and amortization expense noted above.\nIn Orange County, market fundamentals remained favorable throughout 2019. With steady tenant demand and a continued low availability of industrial product in this region, average asking lease rates continued their upward trend during 2019 and vacancy remained at historically low levels. Current regional market conditions indicate the potential for continued rental growth through 2020.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nCash flow from operations is one of our key sources of liquidity and is primarily dependent upon: (i) the occupancy levels and lease rates at our properties, (ii) our ability to collect rent, (iii) the level of operating costs we incur and (iv) our ability to pass through operating expenses to our tenants. We are subject to a number of risks related to general economic and other unpredictable conditions, which have the potential to affect our overall performance and resulting cash flows from operations. However, based on our current portfolio mix and business strategy, we anticipate that we will be able to generate positive cash flows from operations.\n (3) One 24-month extension is available at the borrower's option, subject to certain terms and conditions. \n (1) Effective rent per square foot is the average base rent calculated in accordance with GAAP, over the term of the lease, expressed in dollars per square foot per year. Includes all new and renewal leases that were executed during each respective quarter. \nOur Same Properties Portfolio and Total Portfolio tenant reimbursements revenue increased by $0.8 million, or 2.9%, and $8.2 million or 25.5%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in our Same Properties Portfolio tenant reimbursements is primarily due to an increase in the weighted average occupancy for comparable periods, which was partially driven by the lease-up of the six SPP Stabilized Properties, and an increase in reimbursable property expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in tenant reimbursements revenue due to the adoption of ASC 842 and the related change in reporting for real estate taxes that are paid directly by a lessee to a third party, from a gross basis to a net basis, at three of our properties. Our Total Portfolio tenant reimbursements revenue was also impacted by the incremental reimbursements from the 70 properties we acquired during 2018 and 2019, partially offset by the decrease in reimbursements from the nine properties that were sold during 2018 and 2019.\nCapitalization of Costs\nProperty Expenses\n(iii) 301-445 Figueroa Street, (iv) 28903 Avenue Paine, (v) 15401 Figueroa Street and (vi) 1601 Alton Parkway (collectively, the SPP Stabilized Properties\u201d).\nNet cash used in investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities increased by $465.5 million to $972.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $507.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to a $463.7 million increase in cash paid for property acquisitions and acquisition related deposits and a $12.6 million decrease in net proceeds received from the sale of properties, partially offset by a $10.8 million decrease in cash paid for construction and repositioning projects.\nThe majority of our leases are either triple net or provide for tenant reimbursement for costs related to real estate taxes and operating expenses. In addition, most of the leases provide for fixed rent increases. We believe that inflationary increases to real estate taxes, utility expenses and other operating expenses may be partially offset by the contractual rent increases and tenant payment of taxes and expenses described above. We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our historical financial position or results of operations.\n\nWe account for dispositions of real estate properties, which are considered nonfinancial assets, in accordance with ASC 610-20: Other Income-Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets and recognize a gain or loss on sale of real estate upon transferring control of the nonfinancial asset to the purchaser, which is generally satisfied at the time of sale. If we were to conduct a partial sale of real estate by transferring a controlling interest in a nonfinancial asset, while retaining a noncontrolling ownership interest, we would measure any noncontrolling interest received or retained at fair value, and recognize a full gain or loss. If we receive consideration before transferring control of a nonfinancial asset, we recognize a contract liability. If we transfer control of the asset before consideration is received, we recognize a contract asset.\nMarket Fundamentals\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to FFO (in thousands):\n \u2022 During 2019, we acquired 40 properties, with a combined 5.4 million rentable square feet, for an aggregate cost of $970.7 million.  Repositioning\nSources of Liquidity\nCapital Recycling\nConsolidated Indebtedness\n (2) Noncontrolling interests represent (i) holders of outstanding common units of the Company's Operating Partnership that are owned by unit holders other than the Company and (ii) holders of Series 1 CPOP Units. \n\nOur Total Portfolio acquisition expenses decreased by $0.1 million, or 46.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\n \u2022 Maintaining a ratio of total indebtedness to total asset value of not more than 60%; \nAdditionally, subject to the terms of the Senior Notes, upon certain events of default, including, but not limited to, (i) a default in the payment of any principal, make-whole payment amount, or interest under the Senior Notes, (ii) a default in the payment of certain of our other indebtedness, (iii) a default in compliance with the covenants set forth in the Senior Notes agreement and (iv) bankruptcy and other insolvency defaults, the principal and accrued and unpaid interest and the make-whole payment amount on the outstanding Senior Notes will become due and payable at the option of the purchasers. In addition, we are required to maintain at all times a credit rating on the Senior Notes from either S&P, Moody's or Fitch. As noted above, most recently in November 2019, Fitch affirmed the investment grade rating of the Senior Notes at BBB with a stable outlook.\nmillion of insurance and real estate tax expense during the year ended December 31, 2019, related to our repositioning and redevelopment projects.\n \u2022 In February 2020, we amended our senior unsecured credit facility to, among other changes, increase the aggregate commitment for our unsecured revolving credit facility to $500 million from $350 million and to extend the maturity date of the unsecured revolving credit facility to February 2024 from February 2021. \n(2) Tenant Reimbursements\nOur consolidated results of operations are often not comparable from period to period due to the effect of property acquisitions and dispositions completed during the comparative reporting periods. Our Total Portfolio\u201d represents all of the properties owned during the reported periods. To eliminate the effect of changes in our Total Portfolio due to acquisitions and dispositions and to highlight the operating results of our on-going business, we have separately presented the results of our Same Properties Portfolio.\u201d\nOur operating results depend primarily upon generating rental revenue from the properties in our consolidated portfolio. The amount of rental revenue generated by these properties is affected by our ability to maintain or increase occupancy levels and rental rates at our properties, which will depend upon our ability to lease vacant space and re-lease expiring space at favorable rates.\n (1) Amount relates to the Company's acquisition of the remaining 85% ownership interest in the property located at 3233 Mission Oaks Boulevard from a prior unconsolidated joint venture. For additional information, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Report on Form 10-K. \nFor the comparison of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our Same Properties Portfolio includes all properties in our industrial portfolio that were wholly-owned by us as of January 1, 2018, and still owned by us as of December 31, 2019, which consisted of 144 properties aggregating approximately 18.1 million rentable square feet. Results for our Same Properties Portfolio exclude any properties that were acquired or sold during 2019 and 2018, interest income, interest expense and corporate general and administrative expenses. For the comparison of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our Total Portfolio includes the properties in our Same Properties Portfolio, the 70 properties aggregating approximately 8.4 million rentable square feet that were acquired during 2019 and 2018, and the nine properties aggregating approximately 0.5 million rentable square feet that were sold during 2019 and 2018.\n \u2022 During 2019, we sold 16,817,930 shares of common stock under our various at-the-market equity offering programs, for gross proceeds of $649.3 million, or approximately $38.61 per share, and net proceeds of $639.6 million after deducting the sales agents' fee. \nIn San Diego, although there was an increase in vacancy year-over-year, net absorption was positive during 2019 and average asking lease rates increased year-over-year.\nNOI on a cash-basis ( Cash NOI\u201d) is a non-GAAP measure, which we calculate by adding or subtracting the following items from NOI: i) fair value lease revenue and ii) straight-line rental revenue adjustments. We use Cash NOI, together with NOI, as a supplemental performance measure. Cash NOI should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. Cash NOI should not be used as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP.\nLastly, in the Inland Empire, new industrial product continues to be absorbed well in the market. In the Inland Empire West, which contains infill markets in which we operate, vacancy remained at historically low levels and asking lease rates increased year-over-year. We expect the outlook for the Inland Empire West to remain positive over the upcoming year. We generally do not focus on properties located within the non-infill Inland Empire East sub-market where available land and the development and construction pipeline for new supply is substantial.\nThe following table sets forth the revenue and expense items comprising NOI and the adjustments to calculate Cash NOI (in thousands):\nAs of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the Amended Revolver, leaving $500.0 million available for future borrowings.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in net cash flows associated with our operating, investing, and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):\nInflation\n (5) The GAAP and cash re-leasing rent spreads for renewal leases executed during the year ended December 31, 2019, exclude five leases aggregating 33,404 rentable square feet for which there was no comparable lease data due to either (i) space with different lease structures or (ii) space with lease terms shorter than six months. \nFuture sales, if any, will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including among others, market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and capital needs. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering of shares under the $550 Million ATM Program, if any, to fund potential acquisition opportunities, repay amounts outstanding from time to time under our unsecured revolving credit facility or other debt financing obligations, to fund our development or redevelopment activities and/or for general corporate purposes.\nWe capitalize direct costs incurred in developing, renovating, rehabilitating and improving real estate assets as part of the investment basis. This includes certain general and administrative costs, including payroll, bonus, and non-cash equity compensation of the personnel performing development, renovations and rehabilitation if such costs are identifiable to a specific activity to get the real estate asset ready for its intended use. During the development and construction periods of a project, we also capitalize interest, real estate taxes and insurance costs. We cease capitalization of costs upon substantial completion of the project, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. If some portions of a project are substantially complete and ready for use and other portions have not yet reached that stage, we cease capitalizing costs on the completed portion of the project but continue to capitalize for the incomplete portion of the project. Costs incurred in making repairs and maintaining real estate assets are expensed as incurred.\nOur Same Properties Portfolio and Total Portfolio rental income increased by $10.9 million, or 5.7%, and $53.6 million, or 25.5%, respectively, during the year ended months ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended months ended December 31, 2018, for the reasons described below:\n (9) As of December 31, 2019, the $150 Million Term Loan Facility has been effectively fixed at 2.7625% plus an applicable LIBOR margin through the use of an interest rate swap with a notional value of $150.0 million and an effective date of July 22, 2019. \nOccupancy Rates\nThe Company's growth strategy comprises acquiring leased, stabilized properties as well as properties with value-add opportunities to improve functionality and to deploy our value-driven asset management programs in order to increase cash flow and value. Additionally, from time to time, we may acquire land parcels or properties with excess land where we may construct new buildings. Acquisitions may comprise single property investments as well as the purchase of portfolios of properties, with transaction values typically ranging from a $10 million minimum property investment to portfolios potentially valued in the billions of dollars. The Company's geographic focus remains infill Southern California. However, from time-to-time, portfolios could be acquired comprising a critical mass of infill Southern California industrial property that could include some assets located in markets outside of infill Southern California. In general, to the extent non-infill-Southern California assets were to be acquired as part of a larger portfolio, the Company may underwrite such investments with the potential to dispose such assets over a certain period of time in order to maximize its core focus on infill Southern California, while endeavoring to take appropriate steps to satisfy REIT safe harbor requirements to avoid prohibited transactions under REIT tax laws.\n\nRefer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations\u201d in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on February 19, 2019, for a discussion of the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOur long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for acquisitions, recurring and non-recurring capital expenditures and scheduled debt maturities. We intend to satisfy our long-term liquidity needs through net cash flow from operations, proceeds from long-term secured and unsecured financings, borrowings available under our unsecured revolving credit facility, the issuance of equity securities, including preferred stock, and proceeds from selective real estate dispositions as we identify capital recycling opportunities.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our consolidated portfolio consisted of 213 properties with approximately 26.6 million rentable square feet. In addition, we currently manage an additional 19 properties with approximately 1.0 million rentable square feet.\nWe determine the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property by valuing the property as if it were vacant. This as-if vacant\u201d value is estimated using an income, or discounted cash flow, approach that relies upon Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable inputs based on the Company's assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use. These Level 3 inputs include discount rates, capitalization rates, market rents and comparable sales data for similar properties. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. In calculating the as-if-vacant\u201d value for acquisitions completed during the year ended December 31, 2019, we used discount rates ranging from 5.75% and 7.75% and capitalization rates ranging from 4.50% to 7.25%.\nThe properties in our portfolio are located primarily in Southern California infill markets. Positive or negative changes in economic or other conditions, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters in this market may affect our overall performance.\nOur Same Properties Portfolio and Total Portfolio rental revenue increased by $9.7 million, or 6.0%, and $44.9 million, or 25.3%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in our Same Properties Portfolio rental revenue is primarily due to the increase in the weighted average occupancy of the portfolio for comparable periods, which was partially driven by the lease-up of the six SPP Stabilized Properties, and the increase in average rental rates on new and renewal leases. Our Total Portfolio rental income was also positively impacted by the incremental revenues from the 70 properties we acquired during 2018 and 2019, partially offset by the decrease in revenues from the nine properties that were sold during 2018 and 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2019, 0.7 million rentable square feet of our portfolio was available for lease, 0.3 million rentable square feet of vacant space was under repositioning and leases representing 0.1 million rentable square feet of our portfolio expired on December 31, 2019. Additionally, leases representing 14.7% and 19.8% of the aggregate rentable square footage of our portfolio are scheduled to expire during the years ending December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we renewed 225 leases for 3.3 million rentable square feet, resulting in a 72.8% retention rate. Our retention rate during the period was impacted by the combination of low vacancy and high demand in many of our key markets. New and renewal leases signed during the current year had a weighted average term of 5.2 and 4.6 years, respectively, and we expect future new and renewal leases to have similar terms.\nThe infill Southern California industrial real estate sector has continued to exhibit strong fundamentals. These high-barrier infill markets are characterized by a relative scarcity of available product, generally operating at near full occupancy, coupled with limited ability to introduce new supply due to high land and development costs and a dearth of developable land in markets experiencing a net reduction in supply as more industrial property is converted to non-industrial uses than can be delivered. Consequently, available industrial supply continues to decrease in many of our target infill submarkets, landlord concessions are at cyclically low levels and construction deliveries are falling short of demand. Meanwhile, underlying tenant demand within our infill target markets continues to demonstrate growth, illustrated or driven by strong re-leasing spreads, strong renewal activity, an expanding regional economy, substantial growth in e-commerce transaction and delivery volumes, as well as further compression of delivery time-frames to consumers and to businesses, increasing the significance of last-mile facilities for timely fulfillment. Despite potential concerns related to global growth, tax reform and changes to trade and tariff policies, we continue to observe a number of positive trends within our target infill markets. Based on current observations within the infill Southern California industrial property market and within our property portfolio, we expect these positive trends may continue into the upcoming year.\nMinimum annual lease payments are recognized in rental income on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease, regardless of when payments are contractually due. Rental revenue recognition commences when the tenant takes possession or controls the physical use of the leased space. Lease termination fees, which are included in rental income, are recognized when the related leases are canceled and we have no continuing obligation to provide services to such former tenants.\nFor asset acquisitions, we allocate the cost of the acquisition, which includes the purchase price and associated acquisition transaction costs, to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis. These individual assets and liabilities typically include land, building and improvements, tenant improvements, intangible assets and liabilities related to above- and below-market leases, intangible assets related to in-place leases, and from time to time, assumed debt. As there is no measurement period concept for an asset acquisition, the allocated cost of the acquired assets is finalized in the period in which the acquisition occurs.\n (5) Two additional six-month extensions are available at the borrower's option, subject to certain terms and conditions. \n \u2022 Maintaining a Debt Service Coverage Ratio (as defined in the term loan agreement) of at least 1.10 to 1.00, to be tested quarterly; \nGain or Loss on Sale of Real Estate\nAs of December 31, 2019, our cash and cash equivalents were $78.9 million, and we did not have any borrowings outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility, leaving $350.0 million available for future borrowings.\n (4) The GAAP and cash re-leasing spreads for new leases executed during the year ended December 31, 2019, exclude 56 leases aggregating 1,115,451 rentable square feet for which there was no comparable lease data. Of these 56 excluded leases, 19 leases aggregating 429,087 rentable square feet are leases of recently repositioned space. Comparable leases generally exclude: (i) space that has never been occupied under our ownership, (ii) recently repositioned/redeveloped space, (iii) space that has been vacant for over one year or (iv) space with lease terms shorter than six months. \n (2) Our Same Properties Portfolio\u201d is a subset of our consolidated portfolio and includes all properties that were wholly-owned by us as of January 1, 2018, and still owned by us as of December 31, 2019. A property with a Y\u201d indicates its inclusion in the Same Properties Portfolio and a property with a N\u201d indicates its exclusion from the Same Properties Portfolio. \nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to EBITDAre (in thousands):\nNet operating income ( NOI\u201d) is a non-GAAP measure which includes the revenue and expense directly attributable to our real estate properties. NOI is calculated as rental income less property expenses (before interest expense, depreciation and amortization).\nWe anticipate continuing to selectively and opportunistically dispose of properties, however, the timing of any potential future dispositions will depend on market conditions, asset-specific circumstances or opportunities, and our capital needs. Our ability to dispose of selective properties on advantageous terms, or at all, is dependent upon a number of factors including the availability of credit to potential buyers to purchase properties at prices that we consider acceptable.\n\nScheduled Lease Expirations\nWe account for acquisitions of properties under Accounting Standards Update 2017-01, Business Combinations - Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which provides a framework for determining whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or businesses and further revises the definition of a business.\n (11) Repositioning construction work for 2722 Fairview Street was completed in 4Q-2018. Although the renovated space is still vacant, based on our definition of stabilized in footnote (10) above, 2722 Fairview Street is considered stabilized as of 4Q-2019, one year after the completion of repositioning construction work.  Properties that are nonoperational as a result of repositioning or redevelopment activity may qualify for varying levels of interest, insurance and real estate tax capitalization during the development and construction period. An increase in our repositioning and development activities resulting from value-add acquisitions could cause an increase in the asset balances qualifying for interest, insurance and tax capitalization in future periods. We capitalized $3.9 million of interest expense and $1.3\nThe $60 Million Term Loan contains the following financial covenants:\n\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we completed the sale of three properties and one industrial condominium unit for a total gross sales price of $33.6 million and total net cash proceeds of $32.3 million. The net cash proceeds were used to partially fund the acquisition of three properties during the year ended December 31, 2019, through 1031 Exchange transactions.\nHowever, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. Other equity REITs may not calculate or interpret FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as we do, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity and is not indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends.\nManagement, leasing and development services\n \u2022 As of December 31, 2019, we have leased 42,504 rentable square feet at 2455 Conejo Spectrum Street, 51,925 rentable square feet at 16121 Carmenita Road and our 72,250 rentable square foot building located at 635 8th Street, of which 47,048 rentable square feet is pre-leased with lease commencement expected to occur in March 2020.  Dispositions\nRecoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. To review real estate assets for recoverability, we consider current market conditions as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. The intent with regard to the underlying assets might change as market conditions and other factors change. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, applying a capitalization rate to estimated net operating income of a property, quoted market values and third party appraisals, where considered necessary. The use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan used to manage our underlying business. If our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we will recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the real estate property.\n (4) As of December 31, 2019, one unit with 25,202 rentable square foot unit is occupied and the remaining two units with a combined 47,048 rentable square feet have been pre-leased with lease commencement expected to occur in March 2020. \n \u2022 For the Amended Credit Agreement, $225 Million Term Loan Facility and $150 Million Term Loan Facility, maintaining a minimum tangible net worth of at least the sum of (i) $2,061,865,500, and (ii) an amount equal to at least 75% of the net equity proceeds received by the Company after September 30, 2019; \n \u2022 During 2019 we completed the lease-up and stabilized five of our repositioning properties located at 1998 Surveyor Avenue, 14748-14750 Nelson Avenue, 15401 Figueroa Street, 1332-1340 Rocky Point and 1580 Carson Street with a combined 0.4 million square feet, as well as 109,129 rentable square feet of space at 3233 Mission Oaks Boulevard. \n (1) The estimated construction period is subject to change as a result of a number of factors including but not limited to permit requirements, delays in construction, changes in scope, and other unforeseen circumstances. \n (2) Reflects an estimate of interest payments due on variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps. For variable rate debt where interest is paid based on LIBOR plus an applicable LIBOR margin, we used the applicable LIBOR margin in effect as of December 31, 2019, and the one-month LIBOR rate of 1.7625%, as of December 31, 2019. Furthermore, it is assumed that any maturity extension options available are not exercised. \nConditions in Our Markets\n \u2022 In July 2019, we completed a private placement of $100.0 million of senior notes comprised of $25.0 million of 10-year senior notes at a fixed rate of 3.88% and $75.0 million of 15-year senior notes at a fixed rate of 4.03%. \nlosses, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures.\nInterest Income\nIn order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we are required to distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains. To satisfy the requirements to qualify as a REIT and generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax, we intend to distribute a percentage of our cash flow on a quarterly basis to holders of our common stock. In addition, we intend to make distribution payments to holders of OP Units and dividend payments to holders of our preferred stock.\nUses of Liquidity\n2013 and Rexford Industrial Realty, L.P. (the Operating Partnership\u201d), of which we are the sole general partner, was formed as a Maryland limited partnership on January 18, 2013. Through our controlling interest in our Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, we own, manage, lease, acquire and develop industrial real estate primarily located in Southern California infill markets, and from time to time, acquire or provide mortgage debt secured by industrial property. We are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a REIT under the Code, and generally are not subject to federal taxes on our income to the extent we distribute our income to our shareholders and maintain our qualification as a REIT.\nCash Flow from Operations\nAmended Credit Agreement\nOur Same Properties Portfolio and Total Portfolio property expenses increased by $1.8 million, or 3.9%, and $11.6 million, or 22.5%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in our Same Properties Portfolio property expenses is primarily due to an increase in real estate tax expense relating to\n \u2022 In April 2019, in connection with the acquisition of the property located at 1515 East 15th Street, we issued to the seller 593,960 newly issued 4.43937% Cumulative Redeemable Convertible Preferred Units of partnership interest in the Operating Partnership ( Series 1 CPOP Units\u201d) valued at $27.4 million. \nOn June 13, 2019, we established a new at-the-market equity offering program (the $550 Million ATM Program\u201d) pursuant to which we may sell from time to time up to an aggregate of $550.0 million of our common stock through sales agents. The $550 Million ATM Program replaces our previous $450.0 million at-the-market equity offering program which was established on February 19, 2019 (the Prior ATM Program\u201d). Substantially all $450.0 million of shares of our common stock available under the Prior ATM Program were sold prior to establishing the $550 Million ATM Program.\nResults of Operations\nNote Purchase and Guarantee Agreement\nThe following table sets forth our principal obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2019, including (i) scheduled principal payments and debt maturities, (ii) periodic interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness and interest rate swaps, (iii) office lease payments and (iv) other contractual obligations (in thousands):\nGain on Sale of Real Estate\n (3) See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding leases. As of December 31, 2019, we have additional operating leases for office space that have not yet commenced of $3.4 million which has been included above. \nA repositioning can consist of a range of improvements to a property. This may include a complete structural renovation of a property whereby we convert large underutilized spaces into a series of smaller and more functional spaces, or it may include the creation of additional square footage, the modernization of the building and property site, the elimination of functional obsolescence, the addition or enhancement of loading areas and truck access, the enhancement of fire-life-safety systems or other accretive improvements. Because each repositioning effort is unique and determined based on the property, targeted tenants and overall trends in the general market and specific submarket, the timing and effect of the repositioning on our rental revenue and occupancy levels will vary, and, as a result, will affect the comparison of our results of operations from period to period with limited predictability.\nOur goal is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders by providing superior access to industrial property investments and mortgage debt secured by industrial property in high barrier Southern California infill markets. Our target markets provide us with opportunities to acquire both stabilized properties generating favorable cash flow, as well as properties or land parcels where we can enhance returns through value-add renovations and redevelopment or the development of new industrial buildings. Scarcity of available space and high barriers limiting new construction of for-lease product all contribute to create superior long-term supply/demand fundamentals within our target infill Southern California industrial property markets. With our vertically integrated operating platform and extensive value-add investment and management capabilities, we believe we are positioned to capitalize upon the opportunities in our markets to achieve our objectives.\nInvestment Grade Rating\nProperty Expenses\n\nWe calculate funds from operations ( FFO\u201d) attributable to common stockholders in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d). FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, impairment\nThe following table sets forth certain
