Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K, including this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A), contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 21E of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and Section 27A of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), and is subject to the safe harbors created by those sections. All statements other than statements of historical facts are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements.\nWhen used in this report, the words anticipates\u201d, expects\u201d, intends\u201d, plans\u201d, believes\u201d, seeks\u201d, estimates\u201d, may\u201d, could\u201d, would\u201d, might\u201d, will\u201d and other similar language, as they relate to Open Text Corporation (OpenText or the Company), are intended to identify forward-looking statements under applicable securities laws.

A number of factors may materially affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. These factors include but are not limited to those set forth in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any one of these factors, and other factors that we are unaware of, or currently deem immaterial, may cause our actual results to differ materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Unless otherwise required by applicable securities laws, the Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nThe following MD&A is intended to help readers understand our results of operations and financial condition, and is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAll dollar and percentage comparisons made herein refer to the year ended June 30, 2022 compared with the year ended June 30, 2021, unless otherwise noted. Please refer to Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2021 for a comparative discussion of our Fiscal 2021 financial results as compared to Fiscal 2020.\nWhere we say we\u201d, us\u201d, our\u201d, OpenText\u201d or the Company\u201d, we mean Open Text Corporation or Open Text Corporation and its subsidiaries, as applicable.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nAt OpenText, we believe information and knowledge make business and people better. We are an Information Management company that provides software and services that empower digital businesses of all sizes to become more intelligent, secure and connected. Our innovations maximize the strategic benefits of data and content for our customers, strengthening their productivity, growth and competitive advantage.\nOur comprehensive Information Management platform and services provide secure and scalable solutions for global companies, SMBs, governments and consumers around the world. We have a complete and integrated portfolio of Information Management solutions delivered at scale in the OpenText Cloud, helping organizations master modern work, power modern experiences and optimize their digital supply chains.

Our ticker symbol on both the NASDAQ and the TSX is OTEX\u201d.\nAs of June 30, 2022, we employed a total of approximately 14,800 individuals, of which 7,150 or 49% are in the Americas, 2,720 or 18% are in EMEA and 4,930 or 33% are in Asia Pacific. Currently, we have employees in 35 countries enabling strong access to multiple talent pools while ensuring reach and proximity to our customers. Please see Results of Operations\u201d below for our definitions of geographic regions.\nFiscal 2022 Summary:\n\u2022Total revenue was $3,493.8 million, up 3.2% compared to the prior fiscal year; up 4.3% after factoring in the unfavorable impact of $39.5 million of foreign exchange rate changes.\n\u2022Total annual recurring revenue, which we define as the sum of cloud services and subscriptions revenue and customer support revenue, was $2,866.0 million, up 4.5% compared to the prior fiscal year; up 5.5% after factoring in the unfavorable impact of $26.0 million of foreign exchange rate changes.\n\u2022Cloud services and subscriptions revenue was $1,535.0 million, up 9.1% compared to the prior fiscal year; up 9.8% after factoring in the unfavorable impact of $9.7 million of foreign exchange rate changes.\n\u2022GAAP-based gross margin was 69.6% compared to 69.4% in the prior fiscal year.\n\u2022Non-GAAP-based gross margin was 75.6% compared to 76.1% in the prior fiscal year.\n\u2022GAAP-based net income attributable to OpenText was $397.1 million compared to $310.7 million in the prior fiscal year.\n\u2022Non-GAAP-based net income attributable to OpenText was $876.2 million compared to $927.2 million in the prior fiscal year.\n\u2022GAAP-based earnings per share (EPS), diluted, was $1.46 compared to $1.14 in the prior fiscal year.\n\u2022Non-GAAP-based EPS, diluted, was $3.22 compared to $3.39 in the prior fiscal year.\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was $1,265.0 million compared to $1,315.0 million in the prior fiscal year.\n\u2022Operating cash flow was $981.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2022 compared to $876.1 million in the prior fiscal year, up 12.1%.\n\u2022Cash and cash equivalents were $1,693.7 million as of June 30, 2022, compared to $1,607.3 million as of June 30, 2021.\n\u2022Enterprise cloud bookings was $465.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2022. We define Enterprise cloud bookings as the total value from cloud services and subscription contracts entered into in the fiscal year that are new, committed and incremental to our existing contracts, excluding the impact of Carbonite and Zix.\nSee Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below for definitions and reconciliations of GAAP-based measures to Non-GAAP-based measures. See Acquisitions\u201d below for the impact of acquisitions on the period-to-period comparability of results.\nAcquisitions\nAs a result of the continually changing marketplace in which we operate, we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities within our market and at any time may be in various stages of discussions with respect to such opportunities.\nAcquisition of Zix Corporation\nOn December 23, 2021, we acquired all of the equity interest in Zix Corporation (Zix), a leader in software as a service (SaaS) based email encryption, threat protection and compliance cloud solutions for SMBs. Total consideration for Zix was $894.5 million paid in cash, inclusive of $38.3 million of cash acquired and $18.6 million relating to the cash settlement of pre-acquisition vested share-based compensation. We believe the acquisition increases our position in the data protection, threat management, email security and compliance solutions spaces. The results of operations of Zix have been consolidated with those of OpenText beginning December 23, 2021.\nAcquisition of Bricata Inc.\nOn November 24, 2021, we acquired all of the equity interest in Bricata Inc. (Bricata) for $17.8 million. We believe the acquisition strengthens our OpenText Security Cloud with Network Detection and Response technologies. The results of operations of Bricata have been consolidated with those of OpenText beginning November 24, 2021.\nWe believe our acquisitions support our long-term strategic direction, strengthen our competitive position, expand our customer base, provide greater scale to accelerate innovation, grow our earnings and provide superior shareholder value. We expect to continue to strategically acquire companies, products, services and technologies to augment our existing business. Our acquisitions, particularly significant ones, can affect the period-to-period comparability of our results. See Note 19 Acquisitions\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.\nImpacts of COVID-19\nIn March 2020, COVID-19 was characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The spread of COVID-19 has significantly impacted the global economy and has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our operational and financial performance. The extent of the adverse impact of the pandemic on the global economy and markets will continue to depend, in part, on the length and severity of the measures taken to limit the spread of the virus, the availability, effectiveness and use of treatments and vaccines and on actual and potential resurgences. We are closely monitoring the potential effects and impact on our operations, businesses and financial performance, including liquidity and capital usage, though the extent is difficult to fully predict due to the evolution of this uncertain situation.\nWe continue to conduct business with modifications to employee travel and work locations and also virtualization of certain events, along with modified interactions with customers and suppliers, among other modifications. In addition, as many local governments and officials have started lifting pandemic restrictions in accordance with the guidance of public health experts, in July 2022, we implemented a Flex-Office program in which a majority of our employees work a portion of their time in the office and a portion remotely. See We have implemented a Flex-Office program, which will subject us to certain operational challenges and risks\u201d in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We will continue to actively monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business and geographies, including customer purchasing decisions, and may take further actions that alter our business operations, including our Flex-Office program, as may be required by governments, or that we determine are in the best interest of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers and shareholders. It is uncertain and difficult to predict what the potential effects any such alterations or\nmodifications may have on our business including the effects on our customers and prospects, or our financial results and our ability to successfully execute our business strategies and initiatives.\nThe ongoing and ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control. For more information, please see Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nImpacts of Russia-Ukraine Conflict\nIn response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, we have ceased all direct business in Russia and Belarus and with known Russian-owned companies. Sanctions and export controls have also been imposed by the United States, Canada and other countries in connection with Russia's military actions in Ukraine including restrictions on selling or exporting goods, services or technology to certain regions, and travel bans and asset freezes impacting political, military, business and financial organizations and individuals in or connected with Russia. To support certain of our cloud customers headquartered in the United States or allied countries that rely on our network to manage their global business (including their business in Russia), we have nonetheless allowed these customers to continue to use our services to the extent that it can be done in strict compliance with all applicable sanctions and export controls. However, we may adjust our business practices as required by applicable rules and regulations. Our compliance with sanctions and export controls could impact the fulfillment of certain contracts with customers and partners doing business in these affected areas and future revenue streams from impacted parties and certain countries. While we do not expect our decision to cease all direct business in Russia and Belarus and with known Russian-owned companies to have a material adverse effect on our overall business, results of operations or financial condition, it is not possible to predict the broader consequences of this conflict, including adverse effects on the global economy, on our business and operations as well as those of our customers, partners and third party service providers. For more information, please see Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOutlook for Fiscal 2023\nAs an organization, we are committed to Total Growth\u201d, meaning we strive towards delivering value through organic initiatives, innovations and acquisitions, as well as financial performance. With an emphasis on increasing recurring revenues and expanding our margins, we believe our Total Growth strategy will ultimately drive overall cash flow generation, thus helping to fuel our disciplined capital allocation approach and further our ability to deepen our account coverage and identify and execute strategic acquisitions. With strategic acquisitions, we are well positioned to expand our product portfolio and improve our ability to innovate and grow organically, which helps us to meet our long-term growth targets. We believe our Total Growth strategy is a durable model, that we believe will create both near and long-term shareholder value through organic and acquired growth, capital efficiency and profitability.\nWe are committed to continuous innovation. Our investments in R&D push product innovation, increasing the value of our offerings to our installed customer base, which includes Global 10,000 companies (G10K), SMB and consumers. The G10K are the world's largest companies, ranked by estimated total revenues, as well as the world's largest governments and organizations. More valuable products, coupled with our established global partner program, lead to greater distribution and cross-selling opportunities which further help us to achieve organic growth. Over the last three fiscal years, we have invested a cumulative total of $1.23 billion in R&D or 12.3% of cumulative revenue for that three-year period. On an annual basis, we target to spend 12% to 14% of revenues for R&D expense.\nLooking ahead, the destination for innovation is indisputably the cloud. Businesses of all sizes rely on a combination of public and private clouds, managed services and off-cloud solutions. As a result, we are committed to continue to modernize our technology infrastructure and leverage our existing investments in the OpenText Cloud. The combination of OpenText cloud-native applications and managed services, together with the scalability and performance of our partner public cloud providers, offer more secure, reliable and compliant solutions to customers wanting to deploy cloud-based Information Management applications. The OpenText Cloud is designed to build additional flexibility and scalability for our customers: becoming cloud-native, connecting anything, and extending capabilities quickly with multi-tenant SaaS applications and services.\nWe will continue to closely monitor the potential impacts of COVID-19, inflation with respect to wages, services and goods, concerns regarding any potential recession, rising interest rates, financial market volatility, and the Russia-Ukraine conflict on our business. See Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates, judgments and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other\nassumptions that we believe are reasonable at that time. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates. The policies listed below are areas that may contain key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates and consequently, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Some of these accounting policies involve complex situations and require a higher degree of judgment, either in the application and interpretation of existing accounting literature or in the development of estimates that affect our financial statements. The critical accounting policies which we believe are the most important to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:\n(i)Revenue recognition,\n(ii)Goodwill,\n(iii)Acquired intangibles and\n(iv)Income taxes.\nFor a full discussion of all our accounting policies, please see Note 2 Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe will continue to monitor the potential impact of COVID-19 on our financial statements and related disclosures, including the need for additional estimates going forward, which could include costs related to items such as special charges, restructurings, asset impairments and other non-recurring costs. As of June 30, 2022, we have recorded certain estimates in our Consolidated Financial Statements resulting from the pandemic, particularly with respect to the COVID-19 Restructuring Plan, based on management's estimates and assumptions utilizing the most currently available information. Such estimates may be subject to change particularly given the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic. Please also see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue recognition\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606 \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" (Topic 606), we account for a customer contract when we obtain written approval, the contract is committed, the rights of the parties, including the payment terms, are identified, the contract has commercial substance and consideration is probable of collection. Revenue is recognized when, or as, control of a promised product or service is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for our products and services (at its transaction price). Estimates of variable consideration and the determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based on readily available information, which may include historical, current and forecasted information, taking into consideration the type of customer, the type of transaction and specific facts and circumstances of each arrangement. We report revenue net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue producing transactions.\nWe have four revenue streams: cloud services and subscriptions, customer support, license and professional service and other.\nCloud services and subscriptions revenue\nCloud services and subscriptions revenue are from hosting arrangements where, in connection with the licensing of software, the end user does not take possession of the software, as well as from end-to-end fully outsourced B2B integration solutions to our customers (collectively referred to as cloud arrangements). The software application resides on our hardware or that of a third party, and the customer accesses and uses the software on an as-needed basis. Our cloud arrangements can be broadly categorized as \"platform as a service\" (PaaS), \"software as a service\" (SaaS), cloud subscriptions and managed services.\nPaaS/ SaaS/ Cloud Subscriptions (collectively referred to here as cloud-based solutions): We offer cloud-based solutions that provide customers the right to access our software through the internet. Our cloud-based solutions represent a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. These services are made available to the customer continuously throughout the contractual period. However, the extent to which the customer uses the services may vary at the customer's discretion. The payment for cloud-based solutions may be received either at inception of the arrangement, or over the term of the arrangement.\nThese cloud-based solutions are considered to have a single performance obligation where the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit, and as such we recognize revenue for these cloud-based solutions ratably over the term of the contractual agreement. For example, revenue related to cloud-based solutions that are provided on a usage basis, such as the number of users, is recognized based on a customer's utilization of the services in a given period.\nAdditionally, a software license is present in a cloud-based solutions arrangement if all of the following criteria are met:\n(i)The customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time without significant penalty; and\n(ii)It is feasible for the customer to host the software independent of us.\nIn these cases where a software license is present in a cloud-based solutions arrangement it is assessed to determine if it is distinct from the cloud-based solutions arrangement. The revenue allocated to the distinct software license would be recognized at the point in time the software license is transferred to the customer, whereas the revenue allocated to the hosting performance obligation would be recognized ratably on a monthly basis over the contractual term unless evidence suggests that revenue is earned, or obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern over the contractual term of the arrangement.\nManaged services: We provide comprehensive B2B process outsourcing services for all day-to-day operations of a customers' B2B integration program. Customers using these managed services are not permitted to take possession of our software and the contract is for a defined period, where customers pay a monthly or quarterly fee. Our performance obligation is satisfied as we provide services of operating and managing a customer's electronic data interchange (EDI) environment. Revenue relating to these services is recognized using an output method based on the expected level of service we will provide over the term of the contract.\nIn connection with cloud subscription and managed service contracts, we often agree to perform a variety of services before the customer goes live, such as, converting and migrating customer data, building interfaces and providing training. These services are considered an outsourced suite of professional services which can involve certain project-based activities. These services can be provided at the initiation of a contract, during the implementation or on an ongoing basis as part of the customer life cycle. These services can be charged separately on a fixed fee, a time and materials basis, or the costs associated may be recovered as part of the ongoing cloud subscription or managed services fee. These outsourced professional services are considered distinct from the ongoing hosting services and represent a separate performance obligation within our cloud subscription or managed services arrangements. The obligation to provide outsourced professional services is satisfied over time, with the customer simultaneously receiving and consuming the benefits as we satisfy our performance obligations. For outsourced professional services, we recognize revenue by measuring progress toward the satisfaction of our performance obligation. Progress for services that are contracted for a fixed price is generally measured based on hours incurred as a portion of total estimated hours. As a practical expedient, when we invoice a customer at an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of our performance to date, we recognize revenue at that amount.\nCustomer support revenue\nCustomer support revenue is associated with perpetual, term license and off-cloud subscription arrangements. As customer support is not critical to the customers' ability to derive benefit from their right to use our software, customer support is considered a distinct performance obligation when sold together in a bundled arrangement along with the software.\nCustomer support consists primarily of technical support and the provision of unspecified updates and upgrades on a when-and-if-available basis. Customer support for perpetual licenses is renewable, generally on an annual basis, at the option of the customer. Customer support for term and subscription licenses is renewable concurrently with such licenses for the same duration of time. Payments for customer support are generally made at the inception of the contract term or in installments over the term of the maintenance period. Our customer support team is ready to provide these maintenance services, as needed, to the customer during the contract term. As the elements of customer support are delivered concurrently and have the same pattern of transfer, customer support is accounted for as a single performance obligation. The customer benefits evenly throughout the contract period from the guarantee that the customer support resources and personnel will be available to them, and that any unspecified upgrades or unspecified future products developed by us will be made available. Revenue for customer support is recognized ratably over the contract period based on the start and end dates of the maintenance term, in line with how we believe services are provided.\nLicense revenue\nOur license revenue can be broadly categorized as perpetual licenses, term licenses and subscription licenses, all of which are deployed on the customer's premises (off-cloud).\nPerpetual licenses: We sell perpetual licenses which provide customers the right to use software for an indefinite period of time in exchange for a one-time license fee, which is generally paid at contract inception. Our perpetual licenses provide a right to use intellectual property (IP) that is functional in nature and have significant stand-alone functionality. Accordingly, for perpetual licenses of functional IP, revenue is recognized at the point-in-time when control has been transferred to the customer, which normally occurs once software activation keys have been made available for download.\nTerm licenses and Subscription licenses: We sell both term and subscription licenses which provide customers the right to use software for a specified period in exchange for a fee, which may be paid at contract inception or paid in installments over the period of the contract. Like perpetual licenses, both our term licenses and subscription licenses are functional IP that have significant stand-alone functionality. Accordingly, for both term and subscription licenses, revenue\nis recognized at the point-in-time when the customer is able to use and benefit from the software, which is normally once software activation keys have been made available for download at the commencement of the term.\nProfessional service and other revenue\nOur professional services, when offered along with software licenses, consist primarily of technical and training services. Technical services may include installation, customization, implementation or consulting services. Training services may include access to online modules, or the delivery of a training package customized to the customer's needs. At the customer's discretion, we may offer one, all, or a mix of these services. Payment for professional services is generally a fixed fee or a fee based on time and materials. Professional services can be arranged in the same contract as the software license or in a separate contract.\nAs our professional services do not significantly change the functionality of the license and our customers can benefit from our professional services on their own or together with other readily available resources, we consider professional services distinct within the context of the contract.\nProfessional service revenue is recognized over time as long as: (i) the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as we perform them, (ii) our performance creates or enhances an asset the customer controls as we perform and (iii) our performance does not create an asset with an alternative use, and we have the enforceable right to payment.\nIf all the above criteria are met, we use an input-based measure of progress for recognizing professional service revenue. For example, we may consider total labour hours incurred compared to total expected labour hours. As a practical expedient, when we invoice a customer at an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of our performance to date, we will recognize revenue at that amount.\nMaterial rights\nTo the extent that we grant our customer an option to acquire additional products or services in one of our arrangements, we will account for the option as a distinct performance obligation in the contract only if the option provides a material right to the customer that the customer would not receive without entering into the contract. For example, if we give the customer an option to acquire additional goods or services in the future at a price that is significantly lower than the current price, this would be a material right as it allows the customer to, in effect, pay in advance for the option to purchase future products or services. If a material right exists in one of our contracts, then revenue allocated to the option is deferred and we would recognize that deferred revenue only when those future products or services are transferred or when the option expires.\nBased on history, our contracts do not typically contain material rights and when they do, the material right is not significant to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nArrangements with multiple performance obligations\nOur contracts generally contain more than one of the products and services listed above. Determining whether goods and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or as a single performance obligation may require judgment, specifically when assessing whether both of the following two criteria are met:\n\u2022the customer can benefit from the product or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer; and\n\u2022our promise to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.\nIf these criteria are not met, we determine an appropriate measure of progress based on the nature of our overall promise for the single performance obligation.\nIf these criteria are met, each product or service is separately accounted for as a distinct performance obligation and the total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price (SSP) basis.\nStandalone selling price\nThe SSP reflects the price we would charge for a specific product or service if it were sold separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. In most cases we are able to establish the SSP based on observable data. We typically establish a narrow SSP range for our products and services and assess this range on a periodic basis or when material changes in facts and circumstances warrant a review.\nIf the SSP is not directly observable, then we estimate the amount using either the expected cost plus a margin or residual approach. Estimating SSP requires judgment that could impact the amount and timing of revenue recognized. SSP is a formal\nprocess whereby management considers multiple factors including, but not limited to, geographic or region-specific factors, competitive positioning, internal costs, profit objectives and pricing practices.\nTransaction Price Allocation\nIn bundled arrangements, where we have more than one distinct performance obligation, we must allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its relative SSP. However, in certain bundled arrangements, the SSP may not always be directly observable. For instance, in bundled arrangements with license and customer support, we allocate the transaction price between the license and customer support performance obligations using the residual approach because we have determined that the SSP for licenses in these arrangements are highly variable. We use the residual approach only for our license arrangements. When the SSP is observable but contractual pricing does not fall within our established SSP range, then an adjustment is required, and we will allocate the transaction price between license and customer support at a constant ratio reflecting the mid-point of the established SSP range.\nWhen two or more contracts are entered into at or near the same time with the same customer, we evaluate the facts and circumstances associated with the negotiation of those contracts. Where the contracts are negotiated as a package, we will account for them as a single arrangement and allocate the consideration for the combined contracts among the performance obligations accordingly.\nWe believe there are significant assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition as discussed above and these assumptions, judgments and estimates could impact the timing of when revenue is recognized and could have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. The carrying amount of goodwill is periodically reviewed for impairment (at a minimum annually) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of this asset may not be recoverable.\nOur operations are analyzed by management and our chief operating decision maker (CODM) as being part of a single industry segment: the design, development, marketing and sales of Information Management software and solutions. Therefore, our goodwill impairment assessment is based on the allocation of goodwill to a single reporting unit.\nWe perform a qualitative assessment to test our reporting unit's goodwill for impairment. Based on our qualitative assessment, if we determine that the fair value of our reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than its carrying amount, the quantitative assessment of the impairment test is performed. In the quantitative assessment, we compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired, and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then an impairment loss equal to the difference, but not exceeding the total carrying value of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit, would be recorded.\nOur annual impairment analysis of goodwill was performed as of April 1, 2022. Our qualitative assessment indicated that there were no indications of impairment and therefore there was no impairment of goodwill required to be recorded for Fiscal 2022 (no impairments were recorded for Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, respectively).\nAcquired intangibles\nIn accordance with business combinations accounting, we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Such valuations may require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Acquired intangible assets typically consist of acquired technology and customer relationships.\nIn valuing our acquired intangible assets, we may make assumptions and estimates based in part on information obtained from the management of the acquired company, which may make our assumptions and estimates inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates we may make in valuing certain of the intangible assets that we acquire include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022future expected cash flows of our individual revenue streams;\n\u2022historical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers;\n\u2022the expected use of the acquired assets; and\n\u2022discount rates.\nAs a result of the judgments that need to be made, we obtain the assistance of independent valuation firms. We complete these assessments as soon as practical after the closing dates. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nAlthough we believe the assumptions and estimates of fair value we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill, if the changes are related to conditions that existed at the time of the acquisition. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments, based on events that occurred subsequent to the acquisition date, are recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nIncome taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes\u201d (Topic 740).\nWe account for our uncertain tax provisions by using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not, based solely on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained on audit, including the resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the appropriate amount of the benefit to recognize. The amount of benefit to recognize is measured as the maximum amount which is more likely than not to be realized. The tax position is derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit. On subsequent recognition and measurement, the maximum amount which is more likely than not to be recognized at each reporting date will represent the Company's best estimate, given the information available at the reporting date, although the outcome of the tax position is not absolute or final. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to liabilities for income taxes within the \"Provision for (recovery of) income taxes\" line of our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. These temporary differences are measured using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the extent that we consider it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In determining the valuation allowance, we consider factors such as the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected taxable income and the character of income tax assets and tax planning strategies. A change to these factors could impact the estimated valuation allowance and income tax expense.\nThe Company's tax positions are subject to audit by local taxing authorities across multiple global subsidiaries and the resolution of such audits may span multiple years. Since tax law is complex and often subject to varied interpretations, it is uncertain whether some of the Company's tax positions will be sustained upon audit. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes considers current tax laws, our interpretations of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by domestic and foreign tax authorities. While we believe the assumptions and estimates that we have made are reasonable, such assumptions and estimates could have a material impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements upon ultimate resolution of the tax positions.\nFor additional details, please see Note 15 \"Income Taxes\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following tables provide a detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition.

connection with the licensing of software, the end user does not take possession of the software, as well as from end-to-end fully outsourced B2B integration solutions to our customers (collectively referred to as cloud arrangements). The software application resides on our hardware or that of a third party, and the customer accesses and uses the software on an as-needed basis via an identified line. Our cloud arrangements can be broadly categorized as PaaS, SaaS, cloud subscriptions and managed services. For the year ended June 30, 2022, our cloud renewal rate, excluding the impact of Carbonite and Zix, was approximately 94% compared to approximately 93% for the year ended June 30, 2021.\nCost of Cloud services and subscriptions revenues is comprised primarily of third-party network usage fees, maintenance of in-house data hardware centers, technical support personnel-related costs and some third party royalty costs.\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended June 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change\nincrease (decrease) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change\nincrease (decrease) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cloud Services and Subscriptions: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Americas </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,155,918 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>107,474 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,048,444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>209,001 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>839,443 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EMEA </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>274,824 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,625 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>256,199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,343 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>232,856 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia Pacific </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>104,275 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,473 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>102,802 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,415 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85,387 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Cloud Services and Subscriptions Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,535,017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>127,572 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,407,445 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>249,759 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,157,686 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of Cloud Services and Subscriptions Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>511,713 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,895 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>481,818 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,878 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>449,940 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP-based Cloud Services and Subscriptions Gross Profit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,023,304 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>97,677 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>925,627 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>217,881 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>707,746 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP-based Cloud Services and Subscriptions Gross Margin % </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% Cloud Services and Subscriptions Revenues by Geography: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Americas </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EMEA </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia Pacific </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCloud services and subscriptions revenues increased by $127.6 million or 9.1% during the year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year; up 9.8% after factoring in the unfavorable impact of $9.7 million of foreign exchange rate changes. The increase was primarily driven by the impact of recent acquisitions, along with organic growth over the comparative period. Geographically, the overall change was attributable to an increase in Americas of $107.5 million, an increase in EMEA of $18.6 million and an increase in Asia Pacific of $1.5 million.\nThere were 98 cloud services contracts greater than $1.0 million that closed during Fiscal 2022, compared to 64 contracts during Fiscal 2021.\nCost of Cloud services and subscriptions revenues increased by $29.9 million during the year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year. This was primarily due to an increase in third party network usage fees of $19.9 million, an increase in labour-related costs of $8.1 million and an increase in payroll taxes of $1.5 million. Overall, the gross margin percentage on Cloud services and subscriptions revenues increased to 67% from 66%.\n2) Customer Support:\nCustomer support revenues consist of revenues from our customer support and maintenance agreements. These agreements allow our customers to receive technical support, enhancements and upgrades to new versions of our software products when available. Customer support revenues are generated from support and maintenance relating to current year sales of software products and from the renewal of existing maintenance agreements for software licenses sold in prior periods. Therefore, changes in Customer support revenues do not always correlate directly to the changes in license revenues from period to period. The terms of support and maintenance agreements are typically twelve months, and are renewable, generally on an annual basis, at the option of the customer. Our management reviews our Customer support renewal rates on a quarterly basis, and we use these rates as a method of monitoring our customer service performance. For the year ended June 30, 2022, our Customer support renewal rate was approximately 94%, consistent with the year ended June 30, 2021.\nCost of Customer support revenues is comprised primarily of technical support personnel and related costs, as well as third party royalty costs.\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended June 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change\nincrease (decrease) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change\nincrease (decrease) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer Support Revenues: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Americas </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>743,474 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(250) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>743,724 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,146 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>734,578 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EMEA </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>475,686 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,872) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>481,558 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,111 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>438,447 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia Pacific </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>111,805 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,025 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>108,780 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>102,561 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Customer Support Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,330,965 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,097) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,334,062 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,476 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,275,586 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of Customer Support Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>121,485 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,268) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>122,753 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,141) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>123,894 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP-based Customer Support Gross Profit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,209,480 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,829) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,211,309 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59,617 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,151,692 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP-based Customer Support Gross Margin % </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% Customer Support Revenues by Geography: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Americas </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EMEA </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia Pacific </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCustomer support revenues decreased by $3.1 million or 0.2% during the year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year; up 1.0% after factoring in the unfavorable impact of $16.3 million of foreign exchange rate changes. Geographically, the overall change was attributable to a decrease in EMEA of $5.9 million and a decrease in Americas of $0.2 million, partially offset by an increase in Asia Pacific of $3.0 million.\nCost of Customer support revenues decreased by $1.3 million during the year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year. This was primarily due to a decrease in labour-related costs of $1.9 million and a decrease in third party network usage fees of $0.3 million, partially offset by an increase in other miscellaneous costs of $1.0 million. Overall, the gross margin percentage on Customer support revenues remained stable at 91%.\n3) License:\nOur License revenue can be broadly categorized as perpetual licenses, term licenses and subscription licenses. Our License revenues are impacted by the strength of general economic and industry conditions, the competitive strength of our software products and our acquisitions. Cost of License revenues consists primarily of royalties payable to third parties.\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended June 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change\nincrease (decrease) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change\nincrease (decrease) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>License Revenues: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Americas </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>163,719 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,189 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>159,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(40,116) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>199,646 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EMEA </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>161,735 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16,768) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>178,503 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,296 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>155,207 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia Pacific </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,897 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13,781) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,678 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,320) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,998 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total License Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>358,351 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(26,360) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>384,711 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(18,140) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>402,851 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of License Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,501 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(415) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,916 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,595 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,321 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP-based License Gross Profit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>344,850 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(25,945) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>370,795 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(20,735) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>391,530 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP-based License Gross Margin % </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% License Revenues by Geography: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Americas </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EMEA </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia Pacific </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLicense revenues decreased by $26.4 million or 6.9% during the year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year; down 4.6% after factoring in the unfavorable impact of $8.7 million of foreign exchange rate changes. Geographically, the overall change was attributable to a decrease in EMEA of $16.8 million and a decrease in Asia Pacific of $13.8 million, partially offset by an increase in Americas of $4.2 million.\nDuring Fiscal 2022, we closed 122 license contracts greater than $0.5 million, of which 46 contracts were greater than $1.0 million, contributing $131.7 million of License revenues. This was compared to 122 license contracts greater than $0.5 million during Fiscal 2021, of which 45 contracts were greater than $1.0 million, contributing $131.6 million of License revenues.\nCost of License revenues decreased by $0.4 million during the year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year as a result of lower third-party technology costs. Overall, the gross margin percentage on License revenues remained stable at 96%.\n4) Professional Service and Other:\nProfessional service and other revenues consist of revenues from consulting contracts and contracts to provide implementation, training and integration services (professional services). Other revenues consist of hardware revenues, which are included within the Professional service and other\u201d category because they are relatively immaterial to our service revenues. Professional services are typically performed after the purchase of new software licenses. Professional service and other revenues can vary from period to period based on the type of engagements as well as those implementations that are assumed by our partner network.\nCost of Professional service and other revenues consists primarily of the costs of providing integration, configuration and training with respect to our various software products. The most significant components of these costs are personnel-related expenses, travel costs and third-party subcontracting.\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended June 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change\nincrease (decrease) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change\nincrease (decrease) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional Service and Other Revenues: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Americas </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>124,518 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,133 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>117,385 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(12,598) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>129,983 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EMEA </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>113,956 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,391) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>115,347 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(424) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>115,771 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia Pacific </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,037 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,872 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,165 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(694) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,859 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Professional Service and Other Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>269,511 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,614 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>259,897 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13,716) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>273,613 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of Professional Service and Other Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>216,895 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,712 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>197,183 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15,720) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>212,903 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP-based Professional Service and Other Gross Profit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52,616 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(10,098) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,714 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,004 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,710 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP-based Professional Service and Other Gross Margin % </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% Professional Service and Other Revenues by Geography: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Americas </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EMEA </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia Pacific </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nProfessional service and other revenues increased by $9.6 million or 3.7% during the year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year; up 5.5% after factoring in the unfavorable impact of $4.8 million of foreign exchange rate changes.

In certain limited situations, if the planned activity does not need to be implemented, or an expense lower than anticipated is paid out, we record a recovery of the originally recorded expense to Special charges (recoveries).\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended June 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change\nincrease (decrease) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change\nincrease (decrease) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Special charges (recoveries) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46,873 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,125 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,748 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(98,680) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100,428 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSpecial charges (recoveries) increased by $45.1 million during the year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year.

Tax expense decreased from $339.9 million during the year ended June 30, 2021 to $118.8 million during the year ended June 30, 2022. This was primarily due to (i) a decrease of $300.6 million related to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) settlements in Fiscal 2021, (ii) a decrease of $37.5 million related to lower net income before taxes, (iii) a decrease of $10.8 million related to passive income from foreign subsidiaries, (iv) a decrease of $9.6 million related to tax accruals on unremitted earnings and (v) a decrease of $8.0 million for base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT). These were partially offset by (i) an increase of $94.3 million for changes in unrecognized tax benefits, (ii) a net increase of $46.8 million related to internal reorganizations and (iii) an increase of $3.5 million for change in valuation allowance. The remainder of the difference was due to normal course movements and non-material items.\nFor information on certain potential tax contingencies, including the CRA matter, see Note 14 Guarantees and Contingencies\u201d and Note 15 Income Taxes\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Please also see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company provides certain financial measures that are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP (Non-GAAP). These Non-GAAP financial measures have certain limitations in that they do not have a standardized meaning and thus the Company's definition may be different from similar Non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and/or analysts and may differ from period to period. Thus, it may be more difficult to compare the Company's financial performance to that of other companies. However, the Company's management compensates for these limitations by providing the relevant disclosure of the items excluded in the calculation of these Non-GAAP financial measures both in its reconciliation to the U.S. GAAP financial measures and its Consolidated Financial Statements, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's results.\nThe Company uses these Non-GAAP financial measures to supplement the information provided in its Consolidated Financial Statements, which are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The presentation of Non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be a substitute for financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but rather should be evaluated in conjunction with and as a supplement to such U.S. GAAP measures. OpenText strongly encourages investors to review its financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure. The Company therefore believes that despite these limitations, it is appropriate to supplement the disclosure of the U.S. GAAP measures with certain Non-GAAP measures defined below.\nNon-GAAP-based net income and Non-GAAP-based EPS, attributable to OpenText, are consistently calculated as GAAP-based net income or earnings per share, attributable to OpenText, on a diluted basis, excluding the effects of the amortization of acquired intangible assets, other income (expense), share-based compensation, and special charges (recoveries), all net of tax and any tax benefits/expense items unrelated to current period income, as further described in the tables below. Non-GAAP-based gross profit is the arithmetical sum of GAAP-based gross profit and the amortization of acquired technology-based intangible assets and share-based compensation within cost of sales. Non-GAAP-based gross margin is calculated as Non-GAAP-based gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue. Non-GAAP-based income from operations is calculated as GAAP-based income from operations, excluding the amortization of acquired intangible assets, special charges (recoveries), and share-based compensation expense.\nAdjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) is consistently calculated as GAAP-based net income, attributable to OpenText, excluding interest income (expense), provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization of acquired intangible assets, other income (expense), share-based compensation and special charges (recoveries).\nThe Company's management believes that the presentation of the above defined Non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors because they portray the financial results of the Company before the impact of certain non-operational charges. The use of the term non-operational charge\u201d is defined for this purpose as an expense that does not impact the ongoing operating decisions taken by the Company's management. These items are excluded based upon the way the Company's management evaluates the performance of the Company's business for use in the Company's internal reports and are not excluded in the sense that they may be used under U.S. GAAP.\nThe Company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and therefore believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures, which in certain cases adjust for the impact of amortization of intangible assets and the related tax effects that are primarily related to acquisitions, will provide readers of financial statements with a more consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and be more useful in helping readers understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends. Additionally, the Company has engaged in various restructuring activities over the past several years, primarily due to acquisitions and most recently in response to our return to office planning, that have resulted in costs associated with reductions in headcount, consolidation of leased facilities and related costs, all which are recorded under the Company's Special charges (recoveries)\u201d caption on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Each restructuring activity is a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives or circumstances, and each differs in terms of its operational implementation, business impact and scope, and the size of each restructuring plan can vary significantly from period to period. Therefore, the Company believes that the exclusion of these special charges (recoveries) will also better aid readers of financial statements in the understanding and comparability of the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends.\nIn summary, the Company believes the provision of supplemental Non-GAAP measures allow investors to evaluate the operational and financial performance of the Company's core business using the same evaluation measures that management uses, and is therefore a useful indication of OpenText's performance or expected performance of future operations and facilitates period-to-period comparison of operating performance (although prior performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance). As a result, the Company considers it appropriate and reasonable to provide, in addition to U.S. GAAP measures, supplementary Non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain items from the presentation of its financial results.\nThe following charts provide unaudited reconciliations of U.S. GAAP-based financial measures to Non-GAAP-based financial measures for the following periods presented.\nReconciliation of selected GAAP-based measures to Non-GAAP-based measures\nfor the year ended June 30, 2022\n(In thousands, except for per share data)\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>

(recoveries) from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as special charges (recoveries) are generally incurred in the periods relevant to an acquisition and include certain charges or recoveries that

Other income (expense) also includes our share of income (losses) from our holdings in investments as a limited partner. We do not actively trade equity securities in these privately held companies nor do we plan our ongoing operations based around any anticipated fundings or distributions from these investments. We exclude gains and losses on these investments as we do not believe they are reflective of our ongoing business and operating results.\n(7)Adjustment relates to differences between the GAAP-based tax provision rate of approximately 23% and a Non-GAAP-based tax rate of approximately 14%; these rate differences are due to the income tax effects of items that are excluded for the purpose of calculating Non-GAAP-based net income. Such excluded items include amortization, share-based compensation, special charges (recoveries) and other income (expense), net. Also excluded are tax benefits/expense items unrelated to current period income such as changes in reserves for tax uncertainties and valuation allowance reserves and book to return\u201d adjustments for tax return filings and tax assessments. Included is the amount of net tax benefits arising from the internal reorganization that occurred in Fiscal 2017 assumed to be allocable to the current period based on the forecasted utilization period. In arriving at our Non-GAAP-based tax rate of approximately 14%, we analyzed the individual adjusted expenses and took into consideration the impact of statutory tax rates from local jurisdictions incurring the expense.\n(8)Reconciliation of GAAP-based net income to Non-GAAP-based net income:\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

We do not actively trade equity securities in these privately held companies nor do we plan our ongoing operations based around any anticipated fundings or distributions from these investments. We exclude gains and losses on these investments as we do not believe they are reflective of our ongoing business and operating results.\n(7)Adjustment relates to differences between the GAAP-based tax provision rate of approximately 52% and a Non-GAAP-based tax rate of approximately 14%; these rate differences are due to the income tax effects of items that are excluded for the purpose of calculating Non-GAAP-based net income. Such excluded items include amortization, share-based compensation, special charges (recoveries) and other income (expense), net. Also excluded are tax benefits/expense items unrelated to current period income such as changes in reserves for tax uncertainties and valuation allowance reserves and book to return\u201d adjustments for tax return filings and tax assessments. Included is the amount of net tax benefits arising from the internal reorganization that occurred in Fiscal 2017 assumed to be allocable to the current period based on the forecasted utilization period. In arriving at our Non-GAAP-based tax rate of approximately 14%, we analyzed the individual adjusted expenses and took into consideration the impact of statutory tax rates from local jurisdictions incurring the expense. The GAAP-based tax provision rate for the year ended June 30, 2021 includes an income tax provision charge from IRS settlements partially offset by a tax benefit from the release of unrecognized tax benefits due to the conclusion of relevant tax audits that was recognized during the second quarter of Fiscal 2021.\n(8)Reconciliation of GAAP-based net income to Non-GAAP-based net income:\nTable 30:

During the year ended June 30, 2022, we made repayments of approximately $16.0 million related to amounts previously deferred. As of June 30, 2022, we have remaining deferrals of $23.0 million which will become payable throughout Fiscal 2023.\nCash flows provided by operating activities\nCash flows from operating activities increased by $105.7 million, due to an increase in net income after the impact of non-cash items of $25.9 million and a increase in changes from working capital of $80.0 million.\nThe increase in operating cash flow from changes in working capital was primarily due to the net impact of the following increases:\n(i)$175.4 million relating to income taxes payable, net of receivables;\n(ii)$23.3 million relating to net operating lease assets and liabilities;\n(iii)$21.0 million relating to accounts receivable;\n(iv)$5.4 million relating to other assets; and\n(v)$1.4 million relating to contract assets.\nThese increases in operating cash flows were partially offset by the following decreases:\n(i)$51.7 million relating to prepaid expenses and other current assets;\n(ii)$50.3 million relating to accounts payable and accrued liabilities; and\n(iii)$44.5 million relating to deferred revenues.\nDuring the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022 our days sales outstanding (DSO) was 43 days compared to a DSO of 44 days during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2021, largely a result of improvement in collections efficiency. The per day impact of our\nDSO in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021 on our cash flows was $10.0 million and $9.9 million, respectively. In arriving at DSO, we exclude contract assets as these assets do not provide an unconditional right to the related consideration from the customer.\nCash flows used in investing activities\nOur cash flows used in investing activities is primarily on account of acquisitions and additions of property and equipment.\nCash flows used in investing activities increased by $902.2 million, primarily due to consideration paid for acquisitions during Fiscal 2022, which includes cash paid for the acquisitions of Zix of $856.2 million and Bricata of $17.8 million.\nCash flows provided by (used in) financing activities\nOur cash flows from financing activities generally consist of long-term debt financing and amounts received from stock options exercised by our employees. These inflows are typically offset by scheduled and non-scheduled repayments of our long-term debt financing and, when applicable, the payment of dividends and/or repurchases of our Common Shares.\nCash flows provided by financing activities increased by $1.1 billion. This is primarily due to the net impact of the following activities:\n(i)$1.5 billion relating to proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes 2031 and Senior Notes 2029 (both defined below), of which a portion of the net proceeds was used to redeem $850 million of our Senior Notes 2026 (as defined below).\nThe increases in cash flows provided by financing activities were partially offset by the following decreases:\n(i)$250.0 million relating to higher repayments of our long-term debt and Revolver (as defined below), which is inclusive of $850 million redemption of Senior Notes 2026 (as defined below) during our second quarter of Fiscal 2022, partially offset by $600.0 million repaid on amounts previously drawn on our Revolver in the second quarter of Fiscal 2021;\n(ii)$177.0 million relating to the repurchase and cancellation of 3,809,559 Common Shares under our share repurchase plans authorized on both November 5, 2020 and November 4, 2021 (as discussed below);\n(iii)$25.0 million relating to early call termination premium upon redemption of Senior Notes 2026 and $17.2 million relating to debt issuance costs for the issuance of Senior Notes 2031 and Senior Notes 2029;\n(iv)$27.0 million relating to higher cash dividends paid to shareholders;\n(v)$12.9 million lower proceeds from the issuance of Common Shares for the exercise of options and the OpenText Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP);\n(vi)$46.8 million relating to cash used in the repurchase of Common Shares on the open market for potential reissuance under our Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIP) or other stock compensation plans; and\n(vii)$0.4 million relating to a cash distribution to non-controlling interests holder.\nCash Dividends\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2022, we declared and paid cash dividends of $0.8836 per Common Share in the aggregate amount of $237.7 million (year ended June 30, 2021 and 2020-$0.7770 and $0.6984 per Common Share, respectively, in the aggregate amount of $210.7 million and $188.7 million, respectively).\nFuture declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to final determination and discretion of the Board.

Borrowings under the Revolver are secured by a first charge over substantially all of our assets, on a pari passu basis with Term Loan B. The Revolver has no fixed repayment date prior to the end of the term. Borrowings under the Revolver bear interest per annum at a floating rate of LIBOR plus a fixed margin dependent on our consolidated net leverage ratio ranging from 1.25% to 1.75%.

All Common Shares purchased by us pursuant to the Fiscal 2022 Repurchase Plan have been and will be cancelled.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2022, we repurchased and cancelled 3,809,559 Common Shares for $177.0 million (year ended June 30, 2021 and 2020- 2,500,000 and nil Common Shares for $119.1 million and nil, respectively). Share repurchases during the year ended June 30, 2022 were completed under our share repurchase plans authorized on both November 5, 2020 and November 4, 2021.\nNormal Course Issuer Bid\nThe Company established the Fiscal 2021 NCIB in order to provide it with a means to execute purchases over the TSX as part of the overall Fiscal 2021 Repurchase Plan.\nThe TSX approved the Company's notice of intention to commence the Fiscal 2021 NCIB pursuant to which the Company was authorized to purchase Common Shares over the TSX for the period commencing November 12, 2020 until November 11, 2021 in accordance with the TSX's normal course issuer bid rules, including that such purchases were to be made at prevailing market prices or as otherwise permitted. Under the rules of the TSX, the maximum number of Common Shares that could be purchased in this period was 13,618,774 (representing 5% of the Company's issued and outstanding Common Shares as of November 4, 2020), and the maximum number of Common Shares that could be purchased on a single day was 143,424 Common Shares, which was 25% of 573,699 (the average daily trading volume for the Common Shares on the TSX for the six months ended October 31, 2020), subject to certain exceptions for block purchases, subject in any case to the volume and other limitations under Rule 10b-18.\nThe Company renewed the Fiscal 2022 NCIB in order to provide it with a means to execute purchases over the TSX as part of the overall Fiscal 2022 Repurchase Plan.\nThe TSX approved the Company's notice of intention to commence the Fiscal 2022 NCIB pursuant to which the Company may purchase Common Shares over the TSX for the period commencing November 12, 2021 until November 11, 2022 in accordance with the TSX's normal course issuer bid rules, including that such purchases are to be made at prevailing market prices or as otherwise permitted. Under the rules of the TSX, the maximum number of Common Shares that may be purchased in this period is 13,638,008 (representing 5% of the Company's issued and outstanding Common Shares as of October 31, 2021), and the maximum number of Common Shares that may be purchased on a single day is 112,590 Common Shares, which is 25% of 450,361 (the average daily trading volume for the Common Shares on the TSX for the six months ended October 31,\n2021), subject to certain exceptions for block purchases, subject in any case to the volume and other limitations under Rule 10b-18.\nPensions\nAs of June 30, 2022, our total unfunded pension plan obligations were $63.5 million, of which $2.5 million is payable within the next twelve months. We expect to be able to make the long-term and short-term payments related to these obligations in the normal course of operations.\nOur anticipated payments under our most significant plans, Open Text Document Technologies GmbH (CDT), GXS GmbH (GXS GER), GXS Philippines, Inc.

We have not made any material payments in relation to such indemnification provisions and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnification provisions in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOccasionally, we enter into financial guarantees with third parties in the ordinary course of our business, including, among others, guarantees relating to taxes and letters of credit on behalf of parties with whom we conduct business. Such agreements have not had a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nLitigation\nWe are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings.\nQuarterly, we review the status of each significant legal matter and evaluate such matters to determine how they should be treated for accounting and disclosure purposes in accordance with the requirements of ASC Topic 450-20 Loss Contingencies\u201d (Topic 450-20). Specifically, this evaluation process includes the centralized tracking and itemization of the status of all our disputes and litigation items, discussing the nature of any litigation and claim, including any dispute or claim that is reasonably likely to result in litigation, with relevant internal and external counsel, and assessing the progress of each matter in light of its merits and our experience with similar proceedings under similar circumstances.\nIf the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss in accordance with Topic 450-20. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the aggregate of such accrued liabilities was not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations and we do not believe as of the date of this filing that it is reasonably possible that a loss exceeding the amounts already recognized will be incurred that would be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. As described more fully below, we are unable at this time to estimate a possible loss or range of losses in respect of certain disclosed matters.\nContingencies\nCRA Matter\nAs part of its ongoing audit of our Canadian tax returns, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has disputed our transfer pricing methodology used for certain intercompany transactions with our international subsidiaries and has issued notices of reassessment for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016. Assuming the utilization of available tax attributes (further described below), we estimate our potential aggregate liability, as of June 30, 2022, in connection with the CRA's reassessments for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016, to be limited to penalties, interest and provincial taxes that may be due of approximately $75 million. As of June 30, 2022, we have provisionally paid approximately $34 million in order to fully preserve our rights to object to the CRA's audit positions, being the minimum payment required under Canadian legislation while the matter is in dispute. This amount is recorded within Long-term income taxes recoverable\u201d on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2022.\nThe notices of reassessment for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016 would, as drafted, increase our taxable income by approximately $90 million to $100 million for each of those years, as well as impose a 10% penalty on the proposed adjustment to income. Audits by the CRA of our tax returns for fiscal years prior to Fiscal 2012 have been completed with no reassessment of our income tax liability.\nWe strongly disagree with the CRA's positions and believe the reassessments of Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016 (including any penalties) are without merit, and we are continuing to contest these reassessments. On June 30, 2022, we filed a notice of appeal with the Tax Court of Canada seeking to reverse all such reassessments (including any penalties) in full.\nEven if we are unsuccessful in challenging the CRA's reassessments to increase our taxable income for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016, we have elective deductions available for those years (including carry-backs from later years) that would offset such increased amounts so that no additional cash tax would be payable, exclusive of any assessed penalties and interest, as described above.\nThe CRA has also audited Fiscal 2017 on a basis that we strongly disagree with and are contesting. The focus of the CRA audit has been the valuation of certain intellectual property and goodwill when one of our subsidiaries continued into Canada from Luxembourg in July 2016. In accordance with applicable rules, these assets were recognized for tax purposes at fair market value as of that time, which value was supported by an expert valuation prepared by an independent leading accounting and advisory firm. In conjunction with the Fiscal 2017 audit, the CRA issued a proposal letter dated April 7, 2021 (Proposal Letter) indicating to us that it proposes to reassess our Fiscal 2017 tax year to reduce the depreciable basis of these assets. We have made extensive submissions in support of our position. CRA's position for Fiscal 2017 relies in significant part on the application of its positions regarding our transfer pricing methodology that are the basis for its reassessment of our fiscal years 2012 to 2016 described above, and that we believe are without merit. Other aspects of CRA's position for Fiscal 2017 conflict with the expert valuation prepared by the independent leading accounting and advisory firm that was used to support our original filing position. On January 27, 2022, the CRA issued a notice of reassessment in respect of Fiscal 2017 on the basis of its position set forth in the Proposal Letter. On April 19, 2022, we filed our notice of objection regarding the reassessment in respect of Fiscal 2017. If we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending our position, the estimated impact of the proposed adjustment could result in us recording an income tax expense, with no immediate cash payment, to reduce the stated value of our deferred tax assets of up to approximately $470 million. Any such income tax expense could also have a corresponding\ncash tax impact that would primarily occur over a period of several future years based upon annual income realization in Canada. We strongly disagree with the CRA's position for Fiscal 2017 and intend to vigorously defend our original filing position, We are not required to provisionally pay any cash amounts to the CRA as a result of the reassessment in respect of Fiscal 2017 due to the utilization of available tax attributes; however, to the extent the CRA reassesses subsequent fiscal years on a similar basis, we expect to make certain minimum payments required under Canadian legislation, which may need to be provisionally made starting in Fiscal 2024 while the matter is in dispute.\nWe will continue to vigorously contest the adjustments to our taxable income and any penalty and interest assessments, as well as any reduction to the basis of our depreciable property. We are confident that our original tax filing positions were appropriate. Accordingly, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not recorded any accruals in respect of these reassessments or proposed reassessment in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The CRA is currently in preliminary stages of auditing Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2019.\nCarbonite Class Action Complaint\nOn August 1, 2019, prior to our acquisition of Carbonite, a purported stockholder of Carbonite filed a putative class action complaint against Carbonite, its former Chief Executive Officer, Mohamad S. Ali, and its former Chief Financial Officer, Anthony Folger, in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts captioned Ruben A. Luna, Individually and on Behalf of All Others Similarly Situated v. Carbonite, Inc., Mohamad S. Ali, and Anthony Folger (No. 1:19-cv-11662-LTS). The complaint alleges violations of the federal securities laws under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The complaint generally alleges that the defendants made materially false and misleading statements in connection with Carbonite's Server Backup VM Edition, and seeks, among other things, the designation of the action as a class action, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, costs and expenses, including counsel fees and expert fees, and other relief as the court deems appropriate. On August 23, 2019, a nearly identical complaint was filed in the same court captioned William Feng, Individually and on Behalf of All Others Similarly Situated v. Carbonite, Inc., Mohamad S. Ali, and Anthony Folger (No. 1:19- cv-11808-LTS) (together with the Luna Complaint, the Securities Actions\u201d). On November 21, 2019, the district court consolidated the Securities Actions, appointed a lead plaintiff, and designated a lead counsel. On January 15, 2020, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended complaint generally making the same allegations and seeking the same relief as the complaint filed on August 1, 2019. The defendants moved to dismiss the Securities Actions on March 10, 2020. The motion was fully briefed in June 2020 and a hearing on the motion to dismiss the Securities Actions was held on October 15, 2020. Following the hearing, on October 22, 2020, the district court granted with prejudice the defendants' motion to dismiss the Securities Actions. On November 20, 2020, the lead plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. On December 21, 2021, the First Circuit issued a decision reversing and remanding the Securities Actions to the district court for further proceedings. The defendants remain confident in their position, believe the Securities Actions are without merit and will continue to vigorously defend the matter.\nCarbonite vs Realtime Data\nOn February 27, 2017, before our acquisition of Carbonite, a non-practicing entity named Realtime Data LLC (Realtime Data) filed a lawsuit against Carbonite in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas Realtime Data LLC v. Carbonite, Inc. et al (No 6:17-cv-00121-RWS-JDL).\u201d Therein, it alleged that certain of Carbonite's cloud storage services infringe upon certain patents held by Realtime Data. Realtime Data's complaint against Carbonite sought damages in an unspecified amount and injunctive relief. On December 19, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas transferred the case to the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts (No. 1:17-cv-12499). Realtime Data has also filed numerous other patent suits on the same asserted patents against other companies. After a stay pending appeal in one of those suits, on January 21, 2021, the district court held a hearing to construe the claims of the asserted patents. As to the fourth patent asserted against Carbonite, on September 24, 2019, the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office Patent Trial and Appeal Board invalidated certain claims of that patent, including certain claims that had been asserted against Carbonite. The parties then jointly stipulated to dismiss that patent from this action. On August 23, 2021, in one of the suits against other companies, the District of Delaware (No. 1:17-cv-800), held all of the patents asserted against Carbonite to be invalid. Realtime Data has appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. We continue to vigorously defend the matter, and the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts has issued a claim construction order. We anticipate motion practice based upon the result of that order. We have not accrued a loss contingency related to this matter because litigation related to a non-practicing entity is inherently unpredictable. Although a loss is reasonably possible, an unfavorable outcome is not considered by management to be probable at this time and we remain unable to reasonably estimate a possible loss or range of loss associated with this litigation.\nPlease also see Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2022.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not enter into off-balance sheet financing as a matter of practice, except for guarantees relating to taxes and letters of credit on behalf of parties with whom we conduct business.", "item_7_truncated": "Interest and Other Related Expense, Net\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended June 30, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Per share diluted </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP-based net income, attributable to OpenText </td> <td>$ </td> <td>234,225 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.86 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization </td> <td>425,276 </td> <td> </td> <td>1.56 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share-based compensation </td> <td>29,532 </td> <td> </td> <td>0.11 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Special charges (recoveries) </td> <td>100,428 </td> <td> </td> <td>0.37 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (income) expense, net </td> <td>11,946 </td> <td> </td> <td>0.04 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP-based provision for (recovery of) income taxes </td> <td>110,837 </td> <td> </td> <td>0.41 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP-based provision for income taxes </td> <td>(127,734) </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.46) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP-based net income, attributable to OpenText </td> <td>$ </td> <td>784,510 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.89 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have entered into customer agreements which may include provisions to indemnify our customers against third party claims that our software products or services infringe certain third-party intellectual property rights and for liabilities related to a breach of our confidentiality obligations.

As a result, the Company considers it appropriate and reasonable to provide, in addition to U.S. GAAP measures, supplementary Non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain items from the presentation of its financial results.\nOur initial public offering was on the NASDAQ in 1996 and we were subsequently listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) in 1998.

Such excluded items include amortization, share-based compensation, special charges (recoveries) and other income (expense), net. Also excluded are tax benefits/expense items unrelated to current period income such as changes in reserves for tax uncertainties and valuation allowance reserves and book to return\u201d adjustments for tax return filings and tax assessments. Included is the amount of net tax benefits arising from the internal reorganization that occurred in Fiscal 2017 assumed to be allocable to the current period based on the forecasted utilization period. In arriving at our Non-GAAP-based tax rate of approximately 14%, we analyzed the individual adjusted expenses and took into consideration the impact of statutory tax rates from local jurisdictions incurring the expense.\nIn response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, we have ceased all direct business in Russia and Belarus and with known Russian-owned companies. Sanctions and export controls have also been imposed by the United States, Canada and other countries in connection with Russia's military actions in Ukraine including restrictions on selling or exporting goods, services or technology to certain regions, and travel bans and asset freezes impacting political, military, business and financial organizations and individuals in or connected with Russia. To support certain of our cloud customers headquartered in the United States or allied countries that rely on our network to manage their global business (including their business in Russia), we have nonetheless allowed these customers to continue to use our services to the extent that it can be done in strict compliance with all applicable sanctions and export controls. However, we may adjust our business practices as required by applicable rules and regulations. Our compliance with sanctions and export controls could impact the fulfillment of certain contracts with customers and partners doing business in these affected areas and future revenue streams from impacted parties and certain countries. While we do not expect our decision to cease all direct business in Russia and Belarus and with known Russian-owned companies to have a material adverse effect on our overall business, results of operations or financial condition, it is not possible to predict the broader consequences of this conflict, including adverse effects on the global economy, on our business and operations as well as those of our customers, partners and third party service providers.

Additionally, travel and communication expenses increased by $5.8 million, contract labour and consulting increased by $5.3 million and share-based compensation expense increased by $2.5 million. These increases were partially offset by reductions in other miscellaneous costs, which include professional fees such as legal, audit and tax related expenses, of $8.2 million.

provided in its Consolidated Financial Statements, which are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The presentation of Non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be a substitute for financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but rather should be evaluated in conjunction with and as a supplement to such U.S. GAAP measures.

These agreements allow our customers to receive technical support, enhancements and upgrades to new versions of our software products when available. Customer support revenues are generated from support and maintenance relating to current year sales of software products and from the renewal of existing maintenance agreements for software licenses sold in prior periods. Therefore, changes in Customer support revenues do not always correlate directly to the changes in license revenues from period to period. The terms of support and maintenance agreements are typically twelve months, and are renewable, generally on an annual basis, at the option of the customer. Our management reviews our Customer support renewal rates on a quarterly basis, and we use these rates as a method of monitoring our customer service performance. For the year ended June 30, 2022, our Customer support renewal rate was approximately 94%, consistent with the year ended June 30, 2021.\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Actions related to such restructuring plans are typically completed within a period of one year.

Purchases made under the Fiscal 2021 Repurchase Plan were subject to a limit of 13,618,774 shares (representing 5% of the Company's issued and outstanding Common Shares as of November 4, 2020). All Common Shares purchased by us pursuant to the Fiscal 2021 Repurchase Plan were cancelled.\n\nassumptions that we believe are reasonable at that time. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates. The policies listed below are areas that may contain key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates and consequently, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Some of these accounting policies involve complex situations and require a higher degree of judgment, either in the application and interpretation of existing accounting literature or in the development of estimates that affect our financial statements. The critical accounting policies which we believe are the most important to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:\nThe TSX approved the Company's notice of intention to commence the Fiscal 2021 NCIB pursuant to which the Company was authorized to purchase Common Shares over the TSX for the period commencing November 12, 2020 until November 11, 2021 in accordance with the TSX's normal course issuer bid rules, including that such purchases were to be made at prevailing market prices or as otherwise permitted. Under the rules of the TSX, the maximum number of Common Shares that could be purchased in this period was 13,618,774 (representing 5% of the Company's issued and outstanding Common Shares as of November 4, 2020), and the maximum number of Common Shares that could be purchased on a single day was 143,424 Common Shares, which was 25% of 573,699 (the average daily trading volume for the Common Shares on the TSX for the six months ended October 31, 2020), subject to certain exceptions for block purchases, subject in any case to the volume and other limitations under Rule 10b-18.\nDuring the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022 our days sales outstanding (DSO) was 43 days compared to a DSO of 44 days during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2021, largely a result of improvement in collections efficiency. The per day impact of our\nCustomer support consists primarily of technical support and the provision of unspecified updates and upgrades on a when-and-if-available basis. Customer support for perpetual licenses is renewable, generally on an annual basis, at the option of the customer. Customer support for term and subscription licenses is renewable concurrently with such licenses for the same duration of time. Payments for customer support are generally made at the inception of the contract term or in installments over the term of the maintenance period. Our customer support team is ready to provide these maintenance services, as needed, to the customer during the contract term. As the elements of customer support are delivered concurrently and have the same pattern of transfer, customer support is accounted for as a single performance obligation. The customer benefits evenly throughout the contract period from the guarantee that the customer support resources and personnel will be available to them, and that any unspecified upgrades or unspecified future products developed by us will be made available. Revenue for customer support is recognized ratably over the contract period based on the start and end dates of the maintenance term, in line with how we believe services are provided.\n(ii)$177.0 million relating to the repurchase and cancellation of 3,809,559 Common Shares under our share repurchase plans authorized on both November 5, 2020 and November 4, 2021 (as discussed below);\nOn December 20, 2016, we issued an additional $250 million in aggregate principal amount by reopening our Senior Notes 2026 at an issue price of 102.75%. The additional notes have identical terms, are fungible with and are a part of a single series with the previously issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes 2026. The outstanding aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes 2026, after taking into consideration the additional issuance, was $850 million as of December 9, 2021.\n\n\u2022Non-GAAP-based net income attributable to OpenText was $876.2 million compared to $927.2 million in the prior fiscal year.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations\nThe foregoing description of the 2031 Indenture does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2031 Indenture, which is filed as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 24, 2021.\n(3)GAAP-based and Non-GAAP-based gross profit stated in dollars and gross margin stated as a percentage of total revenue.\nManaged services: We provide comprehensive B2B process outsourcing services for all day-to-day operations of a customers' B2B integration program. Customers using these managed services are not permitted to take possession of our software and the contract is for a defined period, where customers pay a monthly or quarterly fee. Our performance obligation is satisfied as we provide services of operating and managing a customer's electronic data interchange (EDI) environment. Revenue relating to these services is recognized using an output method based on the expected level of service we will provide over the term of the contract.\nFuture declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to final determination and discretion of the Board.

See Acquisitions\u201d below for the impact of acquisitions on the period-to-period comparability of results.\n(i)Revenue recognition,\nThe following tables provide a detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition. For each of the periods indicated below, we present our revenues by product type, revenues by major geography, cost of revenues by product type, total gross margin, total operating margin, gross margin by product type and their corresponding percentage of total revenue.\nWe will continue to vigorously contest the adjustments to our taxable income and any penalty and interest assessments, as well as any reduction to the basis of our depreciable property. We are confident that our original tax filing positions were appropriate. Accordingly, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not recorded any accruals in respect of these reassessments or proposed reassessment in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The CRA is currently in preliminary stages of auditing Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2019.\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and payroll-related benefits expenses, contracted research and development expenses and facility costs. Research and development enables organic growth and improves product stability and functionality, and accordingly, we dedicate extensive efforts to update and upgrade our product offerings. The primary drivers are typically software upgrades and development.\n\n(ii)$23.3 million relating to net operating lease assets and liabilities;\nProfessional service and other revenues consist of revenues from consulting contracts and contracts to provide implementation, training and integration services (professional services). Other revenues consist of hardware revenues, which are included within the Professional service and other\u201d category because they are relatively immaterial to our service revenues. Professional services are typically performed after the purchase of new software licenses. Professional service and other revenues can vary from period to period based on the type of engagements as well as those implementations that are assumed by our partner network.\nThe Fiscal 2022 Repurchase Plan has been and will be effected in accordance with Rule 10b-18. Purchases made under the Fiscal 2022 Repurchase Plan are subject to a limit of 13,638,008 shares (representing 5% of the Company's issued and outstanding Common Shares as of October 31, 2021). All Common Shares purchased by us pursuant to the Fiscal 2022 Repurchase Plan have been and will be cancelled.\nOn October 31, 2019, we amended our committed revolving credit facility (the Revolver) to increase the total commitments under the Revolver from $450 million to $750 million as well as to extend the maturity from May 5, 2022 to October 31, 2024. Borrowings under the Revolver are secured by a first charge over substantially all of our assets, on a pari passu basis with Term Loan B. The Revolver has no fixed repayment date prior to the end of the term. Borrowings under the Revolver bear interest per annum at a floating rate of LIBOR plus a fixed margin dependent on our consolidated net leverage ratio ranging from 1.25% to 1.75%. For more information regarding the impact and discontinuance of LIBOR, see Stress in the global financial system may adversely affect our finances and operations in ways that may be hard to predict or to defend against\u201d included within Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2021.\nCash flows from operating activities increased by $105.7 million, due to an increase in net income after the impact of non-cash items of $25.9 million and a increase in changes from working capital of $80.0 million.\nDSO in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021 on our cash flows was $10.0 million and $9.9 million, respectively. In arriving at DSO, we exclude contract assets as these assets do not provide an unconditional right to the related consideration from the customer.\nDepreciation expenses as a percentage of total revenue remained stable for the year ended June 30, 2022 at 3% compared to the prior fiscal year.\nForward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties that may affect forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: (i) actual and potential risks and uncertainties relating to the ultimate geographic spread of COVID-19, the severity of the disease and the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and issues relating to the resurgence of COVID-19 and/or new strains of COVID-19, including potential material adverse effects on our business, operations and financial performance; (ii) actions that have been and may be taken by governmental authorities to contain the COVID-19 pandemic or to treat its impact on our business (or failure to implement additional stimulus programs) and the availability, effectiveness and use of treatments and vaccines (including the effectiveness of boosters); (iii) the actual and potential negative impacts of COVID-19 on the global economy and financial markets; (iv) integration of acquisitions and related restructuring efforts, including the quantum of restructuring charges and the timing thereof; (v) the possibility that we may be unable to successfully integrate the assets we acquire or fail to utilize such assets to their full capacity and not realize the benefits we expect from our acquired portfolios and businesses, including the acquisition of Zix Corporation, (vi) the potential for the incurrence of or assumption of debt in connection with acquisitions and the impact on the ratings or outlooks of rating agencies on our\nAll dollar and percentage comparisons made herein refer to the year ended June 30, 2022 compared with the year ended June 30, 2021, unless otherwise noted. Please refer to Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2021 for a comparative discussion of our Fiscal 2021 financial results as compared to Fiscal 2020.\nAs part of its ongoing audit of our Canadian tax returns, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has disputed our transfer pricing methodology used for certain intercompany transactions with our international subsidiaries and has issued notices of reassessment for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016. Assuming the utilization of available tax attributes (further described below), we estimate our potential aggregate liability, as of June 30, 2022, in connection with the CRA's reassessments for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016, to be limited to penalties, interest and provincial taxes that may be due of approximately $75 million. As of June 30, 2022, we have provisionally paid approximately $34 million in order to fully preserve our rights to object to the CRA's audit positions, being the minimum payment required under Canadian legislation while the matter is in dispute. This amount is recorded within Long-term income taxes recoverable\u201d on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2022.\nIf the SSP is not directly observable, then we estimate the amount using either the expected cost plus a margin or residual approach. Estimating SSP requires judgment that could impact the amount and timing of revenue recognized.

Upon redemption, Senior Notes 2026 were cancelled, and any obligation thereunder was extinguished. The resulting loss of $27.4 million, consisting of $25.0 million relating to the early termination call premium, $6.2 million relating to unamortized debt issuance costs and ($3.8) million relating to unamortized premium, has been recorded as a component of Other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 23 Other Income (Expense), Net\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn addition, any statements or information that refer to expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, objectives, performance or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking, and based on our current expectations, forecasts and projections about the operating environment, economies and markets in which we operate. Forward-looking statements reflect our current estimates, beliefs and assumptions, which are based on management's perception of historic trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors it believes are appropriate in the circumstances. The forward-looking statements contained in this report are based on certain assumptions including the following: (i) countries continuing to implement and enforce existing and additional customs and security regulations relating to the provision of electronic information for imports and exports; (ii) our continued operation of a secure and reliable business network; (iii) the stability of general political, economic and market conditions, including any potential recession; (iv) our ability to manage inflation, including increased labour costs associated with attracting and retaining employees, and rising interest rates; (v) our continued ability to manage certain foreign currency risk through hedging; (vi) equity and debt markets continuing to provide us with access to capital; (vii) our continued ability to identify, source and finance attractive and executable business combination opportunities; (viii) our continued ability to avoid infringing third party intellectual property rights; and (ix) our ability to successfully implement our restructuring plans. Management's estimates, beliefs and assumptions are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies regarding future events and, as such, are subject to change. We can give no assurance that such estimates, beliefs and assumptions will prove to be correct.\nWe strongly disagree with the CRA's positions and believe the reassessments of Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016 (including any penalties) are without merit, and we are continuing to contest these reassessments. On June 30, 2022, we filed a notice of appeal with the Tax Court of Canada seeking to reverse all such reassessments (including any penalties) in full.\nRevenues, Cost of Revenues and Gross Margin by Product Type\nPensions\nCloud services and subscriptions revenues are from hosting arrangements where in connection with the licensing of software, the end user does not take possession of the software, as well as from end-to-end fully outsourced B2B integration solutions to our customers (collectively referred to as cloud arrangements). The software application resides on our hardware or that of a third party, and the customer accesses and uses the software on an as-needed basis via an identified line. Our cloud arrangements can be broadly categorized as PaaS, SaaS, cloud subscriptions and managed services. For the year ended June 30, 2022, our cloud renewal rate, excluding the impact of Carbonite and Zix, was approximately 94% compared to approximately 93% for the year ended June 30, 2021.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nEven if we are unsuccessful in challenging the CRA's reassessments to increase our taxable income for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016, we have elective deductions available for those years (including carry-backs from later years) that would offset such increased amounts so that no additional cash tax would be payable, exclusive of any assessed penalties and interest, as described above.\nOur anticipated payments under our most significant plans, Open Text Document Technologies GmbH (CDT), GXS GmbH (GXS GER), GXS Philippines, Inc.

The price that we were authorized to pay for Common Shares in open market transactions was the market price at the time of purchase or such other price as was permitted by applicable law or stock exchange rules.\nRevolver\n_________________________________\nAs of June 30, 2022, we have recognized a provision of $19.9 million (June 30, 2021-$27.5 million) in respect of both additional foreign taxes or deferred income tax liabilities for temporary differences related to the undistributed earnings of certain non-United States subsidiaries and planned periodic repatriations from certain German subsidiaries, that will be subject to withholding taxes upon distribution.\nWhere we say we\u201d, us\u201d, our\u201d, OpenText\u201d or the Company\u201d, we mean Open Text Corporation or Open Text Corporation and its subsidiaries, as applicable.\nThere were 98 cloud services contracts greater than $1.0 million that closed during Fiscal 2022, compared to 64 contracts during Fiscal 2021.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K, including this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A), contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 21E of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and Section 27A of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), and is subject to the safe harbors created by those sections. All statements other than statements of historical facts are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements.\nReaders should carefully review Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d and other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other securities regulators. A number of factors may materially affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. These factors include but are not limited to those set forth in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any one of these factors, and other factors that we are unaware of, or currently deem immaterial, may cause our actual results to differ materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Unless otherwise required by applicable securities laws, the Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nProfessional service and other revenues increased by $9.6 million or 3.7% during the year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year; up 5.5% after factoring in the unfavorable impact of $4.8 million of foreign exchange rate changes. Geographically, the overall change was attributable to an increase in Americas of $7.1 million and an increase in Asia Pacific of $3.9 million, partially offset by a decrease in EMEA of $1.4 million.\nFor additional details, please see Note 15 \"Income Taxes\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResearch and development expenses increased by $19 million during the year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of recent acquisitions. Payroll and payroll-related benefits, which is comprised of salaries, benefits and variable short-term incentives, increased by $17.1 million. Additionally, share-based compensation expense increased by $7.3 million and contract labour and consulting increased by $2.6 million. These increases were partially offset by reductions in facility-related expenses of $9.1 million. Overall, our research and development expenses, as a percentage of total revenues, remained stable compared to the prior fiscal year at 13%.\nOn August 1, 2019, prior to our acquisition of Carbonite, a purported stockholder of Carbonite filed a putative class action complaint against Carbonite, its former Chief Executive Officer, Mohamad S. Ali, and its former Chief Financial Officer, Anthony Folger, in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts captioned Ruben A. Luna, Individually and on Behalf of All Others Similarly Situated v. Carbonite, Inc., Mohamad S. Ali, and Anthony Folger (No. 1:19-cv-11662-LTS). The complaint alleges violations of the federal securities laws under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The complaint generally alleges that the defendants made materially false and misleading statements in connection with Carbonite's Server Backup VM Edition, and seeks, among other things, the designation of the action as a class action, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, costs and expenses, including counsel fees and expert fees, and other relief as the court deems appropriate. On August 23, 2019, a nearly identical complaint was filed in the same court captioned William Feng, Individually and on Behalf of All Others Similarly Situated v. Carbonite, Inc., Mohamad S. Ali, and Anthony Folger (No. 1:19- cv-11808-LTS) (together with the Luna Complaint, the Securities Actions\u201d). On November 21, 2019, the district court consolidated the Securities Actions, appointed a lead plaintiff, and designated a lead counsel. On January 15, 2020, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended complaint generally making the same allegations and seeking the same relief as the complaint filed on August 1, 2019. The defendants moved to dismiss the Securities Actions on March 10, 2020. The motion was fully briefed in June 2020 and a hearing on the motion to dismiss the Securities Actions was held on October 15, 2020. Following the hearing, on October 22, 2020, the district court granted with prejudice the defendants' motion to dismiss the Securities Actions. On November 20, 2020, the lead plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. On December 21, 2021, the First Circuit issued a decision reversing and remanding the Securities Actions to the district court for further proceedings. The defendants remain confident in their position, believe the Securities Actions are without merit and will continue to vigorously defend the matter.\nIn bundled arrangements, where we have more than one distinct performance obligation, we must allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its relative SSP. However, in certain bundled arrangements, the SSP may not always be directly observable. For instance, in bundled arrangements with license and customer support, we allocate the transaction price between the license and customer support performance obligations using the residual approach because we have determined that the SSP for licenses in these arrangements are highly variable. We use the residual approach only for our license arrangements. When the SSP is observable but contractual pricing does not fall within our established SSP range, then an adjustment is required, and we will allocate the transaction price between license and customer support at a constant ratio reflecting the mid-point of the established SSP range.\nIf these criteria are met, each product or service is separately accounted for as a distinct performance obligation and the total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price (SSP) basis.\n(2)Adjustment relates to the exclusion of amortization expense from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as the timing and frequency of amortization expense is dependent on our acquisitions and is hence excluded from our internal analysis of operating results.\nOur contracts generally contain more than one of the products and services listed above. Determining whether goods and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or as a single performance obligation may require judgment, specifically when assessing whether both of the following two criteria are met:\nAdjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) is consistently calculated as GAAP-based net income, attributable to OpenText, excluding interest income (expense), provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization of acquired intangible assets, other income (expense), share-based compensation and special charges (recoveries).\nCost of License revenues decreased by $0.4 million during the year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year as a result of lower third-party technology costs. Overall, the gross margin percentage on License revenues remained stable at 96%.\noutstanding debt securities; (vii) the possibility that the Company may be unable to meet its future reporting requirements under the Exchange Act, and the rules promulgated thereunder, or applicable Canadian securities regulation; (viii) the risks associated with bringing new products and services to market; (ix) fluctuations in currency exchange rates (including as a result of the impact of any policy changes resulting from trade and tariff disputes); (x) delays in the purchasing decisions of the Company's customers; (xi) competition the Company faces in its industry and/or marketplace; (xii) the final determination of litigation, tax audits (including tax examinations in Canada, the United States or elsewhere) and other legal proceedings; (xiii) potential exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities or expenses, including with respect to changes in Canadian, United States or international tax regimes; (xiv) the possibility of technical, logistical or planning issues in connection with the deployment of the Company's products or services; (xv) the continuous commitment of the Company's customers; (xvi) demand for the Company's products and services; (xvii) increase in exposure to international business risks (including the impact of geopolitical instability, political unrest, war and other global conflicts) as we continue to increase our international operations; (xviii) adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, disruptions in global supply chains and increased labour costs; (xix) inability to raise capital at all or on not unfavorable terms in the future; (xx) downward pressure on our share price and dilutive effect of future sales or issuances of equity securities (including in connection with future acquisitions); and (xxi) potential changes in ratings or outlooks of rating agencies on our outstanding debt securities. Other factors that may affect forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: (i) the future performance, financial and otherwise, of the Company; (ii) the ability of the Company to bring new products and services to market and to increase sales; (iii) the strength of the Company's product development pipeline; (iv) failure to secure and protect patents, trademarks and other proprietary rights; (v) infringement of third-party proprietary rights triggering indemnification obligations and resulting in significant expenses or restrictions on our ability to provide our products or services; (vi) failure to comply with privacy laws and regulations that are extensive, open to various interpretations and complex to implement including GDPR, California Consumer Privacy Act, California Privacy Rights Act, Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, Colorado Privacy Act, Connecticut Data Privacy Act, Utah Consumer Privacy Act, and Country by Country Reporting (including with respect to transferring personal data outside of the EEA and the United Kingdom, as a result of the ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) that the EU-US Privacy Shield is an invalid data transfer mechanism and that Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) are a valid transfer mechanism unless the country to which personal data is exported restricts the ability to comply with such Clauses (Schrems II), and with respect to the new SCCs published by the European Commission and the IDTA and Addendum published by the United Kingdom's Information Commissioner's Office to meet the requirements of GDPR and Schrems II); (vii) the Company's growth and other profitability prospects; (viii) the estimated size and growth prospects of the Information Management market; (ix) the Company's competitive position in the Information Management market and its ability to take advantage of future opportunities in this market; (x) the benefits of the Company's products and services to be realized by customers; (xi) the demand for the Company's products and services and the extent of deployment of the Company's products and services in the Information Management marketplace; (xii) the Company's financial condition and capital requirements; (xiii) system or network failures or information security, cybersecurity or other data breaches in connection with the Company's offerings or the information technology systems used by the Company generally, the risk of which may be increased during times of natural disaster or pandemic (including COVID-19) due to remote working arrangements; (xiv) failure to achieve our environmental goals on energy consumption, waste diversion and greenhouse gas emissions or our targets relating to ED&I initiatives; and (xv) failure to attract and retain key personnel to develop and effectively manage the Company's business.\nIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company provides certain financial measures that are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP (Non-GAAP). These Non-GAAP financial measures have certain limitations in that they do not have a standardized meaning and thus the Company's definition may be different from similar Non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and/or analysts and may differ from period to period. Thus, it may be more difficult to compare the Company's financial performance to that of other companies. However, the Company's management compensates for these limitations by providing the relevant disclosure of the items excluded in the calculation of these Non-GAAP financial measures both in its reconciliation to the U.S. GAAP financial measures and its Consolidated Financial Statements, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's results.\nThese cloud-based solutions are considered to have a single performance obligation where the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit, and as such we recognize revenue for these cloud-based solutions ratably over the term of the contractual agreement. For example, revenue related to cloud-based solutions that are provided on a usage basis, such as the number of users, is recognized based on a customer's utilization of the services in a given period.\nDuring Fiscal 2022, we closed 122 license contracts greater than $0.5 million, of which 46 contracts were greater than $1.0 million, contributing $131.7 million of License revenues. This was compared to 122 license contracts greater than $0.5 million during Fiscal 2021, of which 45 contracts were greater than $1.0 million, contributing $131.6 million of License revenues.\nThe Company renewed the Fiscal 2022 NCIB in order to provide it with a means to execute purchases over the TSX as part of the overall Fiscal 2022 Repurchase Plan.\n_______________________________\n\u2022the expected use of the acquired assets; and\nWe do not enter into off-balance sheet financing as a matter of practice, except for guarantees relating to taxes and letters of credit on behalf of parties with whom we conduct business.\nCost of Professional service and other revenues increased by $19.7 million during the year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year. This was primarily due to an increase in labour-related costs of $19.4 million and an increase in other miscellaneous costs of $0.3 million. Overall, the gross margin percentage on Professional service and other revenues decreased to 20% from 24%.\nThe effective tax rate decreased to a provision of 23.0% for the year ended June 30, 2022, compared to a provision of 52.2% for the year ended June 30, 2021. Tax expense decreased from $339.9 million during the year ended June 30, 2021 to $118.8 million during the year ended June 30, 2022. This was primarily due to (i) a decrease of $300.6 million related to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) settlements in Fiscal 2021, (ii) a decrease of $37.5 million related to lower net income before taxes, (iii) a decrease of $10.8 million related to passive income from foreign subsidiaries, (iv) a decrease of $9.6 million related to tax accruals on unremitted earnings and (v) a decrease of $8.0 million for base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT). These were partially offset by (i) an increase of $94.3 million for changes in unrecognized tax benefits, (ii) a net increase of $46.8 million related to internal reorganizations and (iii) an increase of $3.5 million for change in valuation allowance. The remainder of the difference was due to normal course movements and non-material items.\n\u2022Enterprise cloud bookings was $465.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2022. We define Enterprise cloud bookings as the total value from cloud services and subscription contracts entered into in the fiscal year that are new, committed and incremental to our existing contracts, excluding the impact of Carbonite and Zix.\nWe continue to conduct business with modifications to employee travel and work locations and also virtualization of certain events, along with modified interactions with customers and suppliers, among other modifications. In addition, as many local governments and officials have started lifting pandemic restrictions in accordance with the guidance of public health experts, in July 2022, we implemented a Flex-Office program in which a majority of our employees work a portion of their time in the office and a portion remotely. See We have implemented a Flex-Office program, which will subject us to certain operational challenges and risks\u201d in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We will continue to actively monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business and geographies, including customer purchasing decisions, and may take further actions that alter our business operations, including our Flex-Office program, as may be required by governments, or that we determine are in the best interest of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers and shareholders. It is uncertain and difficult to predict what the potential effects any such alterations or\nAs of June 30, 2022, our total unfunded pension plan obligations were $63.5 million, of which $2.5 million is payable within the next twelve months. We expect to be able to make the long-term and short-term payments related to these obligations in the normal course of operations.\nTerm Loan B has incremental facility capacity of (i) $250 million plus (ii) additional amounts, subject to meeting a consolidated senior secured net leverage\u201d ratio not exceeding 2.75:1.00, in each case subject to certain conditions. Consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio is defined for this purpose as the proportion of our total debt reduced by unrestricted cash, including guarantees and letters of credit, that is secured by our or any of our subsidiaries' assets, over our trailing twelve months net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, restructuring, share-based compensation and other miscellaneous charges.\n\nCash flows provided by financing activities increased by $1.1 billion. This is primarily due to the net impact of the following activities:\nAmortization of Acquired Technology-based Intangible Assets\n(1)Adjustment relates to the exclusion of share-based compensation expense from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as this expense is excluded from our internal analysis of operating results.\n(iii)Acquired intangibles and\nThe Company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and therefore believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures, which in certain cases adjust for the impact of amortization of intangible assets and the related tax effects that are primarily related to acquisitions, will provide readers of financial statements with a more consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and be more useful in helping readers understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends. Additionally, the Company has engaged in various restructuring activities over the past several years, primarily due to acquisitions and most recently in response to our return to office planning, that have resulted in costs associated with reductions in headcount, consolidation of leased facilities and related costs, all which are recorded under the Company's Special charges (recoveries)\u201d caption on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Each restructuring activity is a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives or circumstances, and each differs in terms of its operational implementation, business impact and scope, and the size of each restructuring plan can vary significantly from period to period. Therefore, the Company believes that the exclusion of these special charges (recoveries) will also better aid readers of financial statements in the understanding and comparability of the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends.\nThe increase in operating cash flow from changes in working capital was primarily due to the net impact of the following increases:\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2022, we repurchased and cancelled 3,809,559 Common Shares for $177.0 million (year ended June 30, 2021 and 2020- 2,500,000 and nil Common Shares for $119.1 million and nil, respectively). Share repurchases during the year ended June 30, 2022 were completed under our share repurchase plans authorized on both November 5, 2020 and November 4, 2021.\nOur cash flows from financing activities generally consist of long-term debt financing and amounts received from stock options exercised by our employees. These inflows are typically offset by scheduled and non-scheduled repayments of our long-term debt financing and, when applicable, the payment of dividends and/or repurchases of our Common Shares.\nOn February 18, 2020 Open Text Holdings, Inc. (OTHI), a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the Company, issued $900 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.125% Senior Notes due 2030 guaranteed by the Company (Senior Notes 2030) in an unregistered offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and to certain non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. Senior Notes 2030 bear interest at a rate of 4.125% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15, commencing on August 15, 2020. Senior Notes 2030 will mature on February 15, 2030, unless earlier redeemed, in accordance with their terms, or repurchased.\nUnder the Revolver, we must maintain a consolidated net leverage\u201d ratio of no more than 4:1 at the end of each financial quarter. Consolidated net leverage ratio is defined for this purpose as the proportion of our total debt reduced by unrestricted cash, including guarantees and letters of credit, over our trailing twelve months net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, restructuring, share-based compensation and other miscellaneous charges.\nOutlook for Fiscal 2023\nOn November 4, 2021, the Board authorized the Fiscal 2022 Repurchase Plan, pursuant to which we may purchase in open market transactions, from time to time over the 12 month period commencing November 12, 2021, up to an aggregate of $350 million of our Common Shares on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the Toronto Stock Exchange (as part of a Fiscal 2022 NCIB) and/or other exchanges and alternative trading systems in Canada and/or the United States, if eligible, subject to applicable law and stock exchange rules. The price that we have paid and will pay for Common Shares in open market transactions has been and will be the market price at the time of purchase or such other price as may be permitted by applicable law or stock exchange rules.\nOur general and administrative labour resources increased by 105 employees, from 1,866 employees at June 30, 2021 to 1,971 employees at June 30, 2022.\n\nIf the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss in accordance with Topic 450-20. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the aggregate of such accrued liabilities was not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations and we do not believe as of the date of this filing that it is reasonably possible that a loss exceeding the amounts already recognized will be incurred that would be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. As described more fully below, we are unable at this time to estimate a possible loss or range of losses in respect of certain disclosed matters.\nAmortization of acquired customer-based intangible assets:\n\nOn February 27, 2017, before our acquisition of Carbonite, a non-practicing entity named Realtime Data LLC (Realtime Data) filed a lawsuit against Carbonite in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas Realtime Data LLC v. Carbonite, Inc. et al (No 6:17-cv-00121-RWS-JDL).\u201d Therein, it alleged that certain of Carbonite's cloud storage services infringe upon certain patents held by Realtime Data. Realtime Data's complaint against Carbonite sought damages in an unspecified amount and injunctive relief. On December 19, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas transferred the case to the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts (No. 1:17-cv-12499). Realtime Data has also filed numerous other patent suits on the same asserted patents against other companies. After a stay pending appeal in one of those suits, on January 21, 2021, the district court held a hearing to construe the claims of the asserted patents. As to the fourth patent asserted against Carbonite, on September 24, 2019, the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office Patent Trial and Appeal Board invalidated certain claims of that patent, including certain claims that had been asserted against Carbonite. The parties then jointly stipulated to dismiss that patent from this action. On August 23, 2021, in one of the suits against other companies, the District of Delaware (No. 1:17-cv-800), held all of the patents asserted against Carbonite to be invalid. Realtime Data has appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. We continue to vigorously defend the matter, and the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts has issued a claim construction order. We anticipate motion practice based upon the result of that order. We have not accrued a loss contingency related to this matter because litigation related to a non-practicing entity is inherently unpredictable. Although a loss is reasonably possible, an unfavorable outcome is not considered by management to be probable at this time and we remain unable to reasonably estimate a possible loss or range of loss associated with this litigation.\n(In thousands, except for per share data)\nIf we experience one of the kinds of change of control triggering events specified in the 2031 Indenture, OTHI will be required to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes 2031 at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes 2031, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase.\nWe may redeem all or a portion of the Senior Notes 2028 at any time prior to February 15, 2023 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes 2028 plus an applicable premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. We may also redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes 2028, on one or more occasions, prior to February 15, 2023, using the net proceeds from certain qualified equity offerings at a redemption price of 103.875% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, subject to compliance with certain conditions. We may, on one or more occasions, redeem the Senior Notes 2028, in whole or in part, at any time on and after February 15, 2023 at the applicable redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the Senior Notes 2028, dated as of February 18, 2020, among the Company, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, The Bank of New York Mellon, as U.S. trustee, and BNY Trust Company of Canada, as Canadian trustee (the 2028 Indenture), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date.\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses and costs associated with advertising, marketing events and trade shows.\nIn valuing our acquired intangible assets, we may make assumptions and estimates based in part on information obtained from the management of the acquired company, which may make our assumptions and estimates inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates we may make in valuing certain of the intangible assets that we acquire include, but are not limited to:\nThe 2031 Indenture contains covenants that limit OTHI, the Company and certain of the Company's subsidiaries' ability to, among other things: (i) create certain liens and enter into sale and lease-back transactions; (ii) in the case of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, create, assume, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness of OTHI, the Company or the guarantors without such subsidiary becoming a subsidiary guarantor of Senior Notes 2031; and (iii) consolidate, amalgamate or merge with, or convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of its property and assets substantially as an entirety to, another person. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions as set forth in the 2031 Indenture. The 2031 Indenture also provides for events of default, which, if any of them occurs, may permit or, in certain circumstances, require the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then-outstanding Senior Notes 2031 to be due and payable immediately.\nCash flows provided by (used in) financing activities\nSenior Notes 2031 are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company and the Company's existing and future wholly-owned subsidiaries (other than OTHI) that borrow or guarantee the obligations under our existing senior credit facilities. Senior Notes 2031 and the guarantees rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company's, OTHI's and the guarantors' existing and future senior unsubordinated debt and will rank senior in right of payment to all of the Company's, OTHI's and the guarantors' future subordinated debt. Senior Notes 2031 and the guarantees will be effectively subordinated to all of the Company's, OTHI's and the guarantors' existing and future secured debt, including the obligations under the senior credit facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such secured debt.\nWe perform a qualitative assessment to test our reporting unit's goodwill for impairment. Based on our qualitative assessment, if we determine that the fair value of our reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than its carrying amount, the quantitative assessment of the impairment test is performed. In the quantitative assessment, we compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired, and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then an impairment loss equal to the difference, but not exceeding the total carrying value of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit, would be recorded.\n\u2022GAAP-based gross margin was 69.6% compared to 69.4% in the prior fiscal year.\nOccasionally, we enter into financial guarantees with third parties in the ordinary course of our business, including, among others, guarantees relating to taxes and letters of credit on behalf of parties with whom we conduct business. Such agreements have not had a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA\nis recognized at the point-in-time when the customer is able to use and benefit from the software, which is normally once software activation keys have been made available for download at the commencement of the term.\nWe have four revenue streams: cloud services and subscriptions, customer support, license and professional service and other.\n(iii)$21.0 million relating to accounts receivable;\nOTHI may redeem all or a portion of the Senior Notes 2031 at any time prior to December 1, 2026 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes 2031 plus an applicable premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. OTHI may also redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes 2031, on one or more occasions, prior to December 1, 2024, using the net proceeds from certain qualified equity offerings at a redemption price of 104.125% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, subject to compliance with certain conditions. OTHI may, on one or more occasions, redeem the Senior Notes 2031, in whole or in part, at any time on and after December 1, 2026 at the applicable redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the Senior Notes 2031, dated as of November 24, 2021, among OTHI, the Company, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, The Bank of New York Mellon, as U.S. trustee, and BNY Trust Company of Canada, as Canadian trustee (the 2031 Indenture), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date.\nOur annual impairment analysis of goodwill was performed as of April 1, 2022. Our qualitative assessment indicated that there were no indications of impairment and therefore there was no impairment of goodwill required to be recorded for Fiscal 2022 (no impairments were recorded for Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, respectively).\n\u2022Non-GAAP-based EPS, diluted, was $3.22 compared to $3.39 in the prior fiscal year.\n(7)Adjustment relates to differences between the GAAP-based tax provision rate of approximately 23% and a Non-GAAP-based tax rate of approximately 14%; these rate differences are due to the income tax effects of items that are excluded for the purpose of calculating Non-GAAP-based net income. Such excluded items include amortization, share-based compensation, special charges (recoveries) and other income (expense), net. Also excluded are tax benefits/expense items unrelated to current period income such as changes in reserves for tax uncertainties and valuation allowance reserves and book to return\u201d adjustments for tax return filings and tax assessments. Included is the amount of net tax benefits arising from the internal reorganization that occurred in Fiscal 2017 assumed to be allocable to the current period based on the forecasted utilization period. In arriving at our Non-GAAP-based tax rate of approximately 14%, we analyzed the individual adjusted expenses and took into consideration the impact of statutory tax rates from local jurisdictions incurring the expense.\nOn December 9, 2021, we redeemed Senior Notes 2026 in full at a price equal to 102.9375% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. A portion of the net proceeds from the offerings of Senior\nFor further details relating to our debt, please see Note 11 Long-Term Debt\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSenior Notes 2031\n\u2022GAAP-based net income attributable to OpenText was $397.1 million compared to $310.7 million in the prior fiscal year.\n(i)$175.4 million relating to income taxes payable, net of receivables;\n(ii)It is feasible for the customer to host the software independent of us.\nIf we experience one of the kinds of change of control triggering events specified in the 2029 Indenture, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes 2029 at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes 2029, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase.\nUnder Term Loan B, we must maintain a consolidated net leverage\u201d ratio of no more than 4:1 at the end of each financial quarter. Consolidated net leverage ratio is defined for this purpose as the proportion of our total debt reduced by unrestricted cash, including guarantees and letters of credit, over our trailing twelve months net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, restructuring, share-based compensation and other miscellaneous charges. As of June 30, 2022, our consolidated net leverage ratio was 2.0:1.\nBased on history, our contracts do not typically contain material rights and when they do, the material right is not significant to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTo the extent that we grant our customer an option to acquire additional products or services in one of our arrangements, we will account for the option as a distinct performance obligation in the contract only if the option provides a material right to the customer that the customer would not receive without entering into the contract. For example, if we give the customer an option to acquire additional goods or services in the future at a price that is significantly lower than the current price, this would be a material right as it allows the customer to, in effect, pay in advance for the option to purchase future products or services. If a material right exists in one of our contracts, then revenue allocated to the option is deferred and we would recognize that deferred revenue only when those future products or services are transferred or when the option expires.\nWe believe our acquisitions support our long-term strategic direction, strengthen our competitive position, expand our customer base, provide greater scale to accelerate innovation, grow our earnings and provide superior shareholder value. We expect to continue to strategically acquire companies, products, services and technologies to augment our existing business. Our acquisitions, particularly significant ones, can affect the period-to-period comparability of our results. See Note 19 Acquisitions\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.\nOur operations are analyzed by management and our chief operating decision maker (CODM) as being part of a single industry segment: the design, development, marketing and sales of Information Management software and solutions. Therefore, our goodwill impairment assessment is based on the allocation of goodwill to a single reporting unit.\nWe are fundamentally integrated into the parts of our customers' businesses that matter, so they can securely manage the complexity of information flow end to end. Through automation and AI, we connect, synthesize and deliver information where it is needed to drive new efficiencies, experiences and insights. We make information more valuable by connecting it to digital business processes, enriching it with capture and analytics, protecting and securing it throughout its entire lifecycle, and leveraging it to create engaging digital experiences. Our solutions also connect large digital supply chains in manufacturing, retail and financial services.\n\n(2)Adjustment relates to the exclusion of amortization expense from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as the timing and frequency of amortization expense is dependent on our acquisitions and is hence excluded from our internal analysis of operating results.\nProfessional service revenue is recognized over time as long as: (i) the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as we perform them, (ii) our performance creates or enhances an asset the customer controls as we perform and (iii) our performance does not create an asset with an alternative use, and we have the enforceable right to payment.\nAs a result of the judgments that need to be made, we obtain the assistance of independent valuation firms. We complete these assessments as soon as practical after the closing dates. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nDepreciation expenses:\n\u2022Total revenue was $3,493.8 million, up 3.2% compared to the prior fiscal year; up 4.3% after factoring in the unfavorable impact of $39.5 million of foreign exchange rate changes.\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and payroll related benefits expenses, related overhead, audit fees, other professional fees, contract labour and consulting expenses and public company costs.\nThe increases in cash flows provided by financing activities were partially offset by the following decreases:\nCustomer support revenue is associated with perpetual, term license and off-cloud subscription arrangements. As customer support is not critical to the customers' ability to derive benefit from their right to use our software, customer support is considered a distinct performance obligation when sold together in a bundled arrangement along with the software.\nOur license revenue can be broadly categorized as perpetual licenses, term licenses and subscription licenses, all of which are deployed on the customer's premises (off-cloud).\n(4)Asia Pacific primarily consists of Japan, Australia, China, Korea, Philippines, Singapore, India and New Zealand.\nOur cash flows used in investing activities is primarily on account of acquisitions and additions of property and equipment.\n(In thousands, except for per share data)\nCRA Matter\nSenior Notes 2026\nQuarterly, we review the status of each significant legal matter and evaluate such matters to determine how they should be treated for accounting and disclosure purposes in accordance with the requirements of ASC Topic 450-20 Loss Contingencies\u201d (Topic 450-20). Specifically, this evaluation process includes the centralized tracking and itemization of the status of all our disputes and litigation items, discussing the nature of any litigation and claim, including any dispute or claim that is reasonably likely to result in litigation, with relevant internal and external counsel, and assessing the progress of each matter in light of its merits and our experience with similar proceedings under similar circumstances.\nSenior Notes 2030\nLooking ahead, the destination for innovation is indisputably the cloud. Businesses of all sizes rely on a combination of public and private clouds, managed services and off-cloud solutions. As a result, we are committed to continue to modernize our technology infrastructure and leverage our existing investments in the OpenText Cloud.

Any further material or acquisition-related activities may require additional sources of financing and would be subject to the financial covenants established under our credit facilities. For more details, see Long-term Debt and Credit Facilities\u201d below.\nOur sales and marketing labour resources increased by 256 employees, from 2,454 employees at June 30, 2021 to 2,710 employees at June 30, 2022.\n(4)Adjustment relates to the exclusion of special charges (recoveries) from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as special charges (recoveries) are generally incurred in the periods relevant to an acquisition and include certain charges or recoveries that are not indicative or related to continuing operations and are therefore excluded from our internal analysis of operating results. See Note 18 Special Charges (Recoveries)\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.\nFiscal 2022 Summary:\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. The carrying amount of goodwill is periodically reviewed for impairment (at a minimum annually) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of this asset may not be recoverable.\nAcquisitions\nSales and marketing expenses increased by $54.9 million during the year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year, partially as a result of recent acquisitions. Payroll and payroll-related benefits, which is comprised of salaries, benefits and variable short-term incentives, increased by $38.6 million. Additionally, marketing expenses increased by $9.6 million, commissions increased by $7.0 million, other miscellaneous costs increased by $4.6 million, share-based compensation expense increased by $4.3 million and travel and communication expenses increased by $3.8 million. These increases were partially offset by reductions in credit loss expense of $9.0 million and reductions in facility-related expenses of $4.0 million. Overall, our sales and marketing expenses, as a percentage of total revenues, increased to 19% from 18% the prior fiscal year.\n(3)EMEA primarily consists of countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\nOur License revenue can be broadly categorized as perpetual licenses, term licenses and subscription licenses. Our License revenues are impacted by the strength of general economic and industry conditions, the competitive strength of our software products and our acquisitions. Cost of License revenues consists primarily of royalties payable to third parties.\nWe will continue to monitor the potential impact of COVID-19 on our financial statements and related disclosures, including the need for additional estimates going forward, which could include costs related to items such as special charges, restructurings, asset impairments and other non-recurring costs. As of June 30, 2022, we have recorded certain estimates in our Consolidated Financial Statements resulting from the pandemic, particularly with respect to the COVID-19 Restructuring Plan, based on management's estimates and assumptions utilizing the most currently available information. Such estimates may be subject to change particularly given the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic. Please also see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAs a result of the continually changing marketplace in which we operate, we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities within our market and at any time may be in various stages of discussions with respect to such opportunities.\nOn May 30, 2018, we entered into a credit facility, which provides for a $1 billion term loan facility with certain lenders named therein, Barclays Bank PLC (Barclays), as sole administrative agent and collateral agent, and as lead arranger and joint bookrunner (Term Loan B) and borrowed the full amount on May 30, 2018 to, among other things, repay in full the loans under our prior $800 million term loan credit facility originally entered into on January 16, 2014. Repayments made under Term Loan B are equal to 0.25% of the principal amount in equal quarterly installments for the life of Term Loan B, with the remainder due at maturity.\nWe believe there are significant assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition as discussed above and these assumptions, judgments and estimates could impact the timing of when revenue is recognized and could have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn addition, we provide Non-GAAP measures for the periods discussed in order to provide additional information to investors that we believe will be useful as this presentation is in line with how our management assesses our Company's performance. See Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below for a reconciliation of GAAP-based measures to Non-GAAP-based measures.\nin full $800 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.625% Senior Notes due 2023 (Senior Notes 2023), which resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment of $17.9 million. Of this, $6.7 million related to unamortized debt issuance costs and the remaining $11.2 million related to the early termination call premium.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates, judgments and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other\n(In thousands, except for per share data)\nCloud services and subscriptions revenue\nOur solutions also enable organizations and consumers to secure their information so that they can collaborate with confidence, stay ahead of the regulatory technology curve, identify threats on any endpoint or across their networks, enable privacy, leverage eDiscovery and digital forensics to defensibly investigate and collect evidence, and ensure business continuity in the event of a security incident.\nAt OpenText, we believe information and knowledge make business and people better.

OTHI may also redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes 2030, on one or more occasions, prior to February 15, 2025, using the net proceeds from certain qualified equity offerings at a redemption price of 104.125% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, subject to compliance with certain conditions. OTHI may, on one or more occasions, redeem the Senior Notes 2030, in whole or in part, at any time on and after February 15, 2025 at the applicable redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the Senior Notes 2030, dated as of February 18, 2020, among OTHI, the Company, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, The Bank of New York Mellon, as U.S. trustee, and BNY Trust Company of Canada, as Canadian trustee (the 2030 Indenture), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date.\nThe Company's management believes that the presentation of the above defined Non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors because they portray the financial results of the Company before the impact of certain non-operational charges. The use of the term non-operational charge\u201d is defined for this purpose as an expense that does not impact the ongoing operating decisions taken by the Company's management. These items are excluded based upon the way the Company's management evaluates the performance of the Company's business for use in the Company's internal reports and are not excluded in the sense that they may be used under U.S. GAAP.\nThe 2030 Indenture contains covenants that limit the Company, OTHI and certain of the Company's subsidiaries' ability to, among other things: (i) create certain liens and enter into sale and lease-back transactions; (ii) in the case of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, create, assume, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness of the Company, OTHI or the guarantors without such subsidiary becoming a subsidiary guarantor of Senior Notes 2030; and (iii) consolidate, amalgamate or merge with, or convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of its property and assets substantially as an entirety to, another person. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions as set forth in the 2030 Indenture. The 2030 Indenture also provides for events of default, which, if any of them occurs, may permit or, in certain circumstances, require the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then-outstanding Senior Notes 2030 to be due and payable immediately.\n\nPerpetual licenses: We sell perpetual licenses which provide customers the right to use software for an indefinite period of time in exchange for a one-time license fee, which is generally paid at contract inception. Our perpetual licenses provide a right to use intellectual property (IP) that is functional in nature and have significant stand-alone functionality. Accordingly, for perpetual licenses of functional IP, revenue is recognized at the point-in-time when control has been transferred to the customer, which normally occurs once software activation keys have been made available for download.\nof 4.125% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1, commencing on June 1, 2022. Senior Notes 2031 will mature on December 1, 2031, unless earlier redeemed, in accordance with their terms, or repurchased.\nAlthough we believe the assumptions and estimates of fair value we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill, if the changes are related to conditions that existed at the time of the acquisition. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments, based on events that occurred subsequent to the acquisition date, are recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe SSP reflects the price we would charge for a specific product or service if it were sold separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. In most cases we are able to establish the SSP based on observable data. We typically establish a narrow SSP range for our products and services and assess this range on a periodic basis or when material changes in facts and circumstances warrant a review.\n\u2022Cash and cash equivalents were $1,693.7 million as of June 30, 2022, compared to $1,607.3 million as of June 30, 2021.\n(8)Reconciliation of GAAP-based net income to Non-GAAP-based net income:\n__________________________\n(i)$51.7 million relating to prepaid expenses and other current assets;\n(1)Represents our share in net income of equity investees, which approximates fair value and subject to volatility based on market trends and business conditions, based on our interest in certain investment funds in which we are a limited partner. Our interests in each of these investees range from 4% to below 20% and these investments are accounted for using the equity method (see Note 9 Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details).\n\nOperating Expenses\n\n\nTerm licenses and Subscription licenses: We sell both term and subscription licenses which provide customers the right to use software for a specified period in exchange for a fee, which may be paid at contract inception or paid in installments over the period of the contract. Like perpetual licenses, both our term licenses and subscription licenses are functional IP that have significant stand-alone functionality. Accordingly, for both term and subscription licenses, revenue\nProfessional service and other revenue\nThe TSX approved the Company's notice of intention to commence the Fiscal 2022 NCIB pursuant to which the Company may purchase Common Shares over the TSX for the period commencing November 12, 2021 until November 11, 2022 in accordance with the TSX's normal course issuer bid rules, including that such purchases are to be made at prevailing market prices or as otherwise permitted.

This was due to an increase of $9.4 million relating to amortization of newly acquired customer-based intangible assets from recent acquisitions, partially offset by a reduction of $8.8 million relating to intangible assets from previous acquisitions becoming fully amortized.\n\u2022Non-GAAP-based gross margin was 75.6% compared to 76.1% in the prior fiscal year.\n__________________________\n(4)Adjustment relates to the exclusion of special charges (recoveries) from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as special charges (recoveries) are generally incurred in the periods relevant to an acquisition and include certain charges or recoveries that are not indicative or related to continuing operations and are therefore excluded from our internal analysis of operating results. See Note 18 \"Special Charges (Recoveries)\" to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nBorrowings under Term Loan B bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin plus, at the borrower's option, either (1) the Eurodollar rate for the interest period relevant to such borrowing or (2) an ABR rate. The applicable margin for borrowings under Term Loan B is 1.75%, with respect to LIBOR advances and 0.75%, with respect to ABR advances. The interest on the current outstanding balance for Term Loan B is equal to 1.75% plus LIBOR (subject to a 0.00% floor). As of June 30, 2022, the outstanding balance on the Term Loan B bears an interest rate of 2.81%.

We may also redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes 2029, on one or more occasions, prior to December 1, 2024, using the net proceeds from certain qualified equity offerings at a redemption price of 103.875% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, subject to compliance with certain conditions. We may, on one or more occasions, redeem the Senior Notes 2029, in whole or in part, at any time on and after December 1, 2024 at the applicable redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the Senior Notes 2029, dated as of November 24, 2021, among the Company, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, The Bank of New York Mellon, as U.S. trustee, and BNY Trust Company of Canada, as Canadian trustee (the 2029 Indenture), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe following MD&A is intended to help readers understand our results of operations and financial condition, and is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSenior Notes 2029 are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by our existing and future wholly-owned subsidiaries that borrow or guarantee the obligations under our existing senior credit facilities. Senior Notes 2029 and the guarantees rank equally in right of payment with all of our and our guarantors' existing and future senior unsubordinated debt and will rank senior in right of payment to all of our and our guarantors' future subordinated debt. Senior Notes 2029 and the guarantees will be effectively subordinated to all of our and our guarantors' existing and future secured debt, including the obligations under the senior credit facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such secured debt.\nWe operate in several tax jurisdictions and are exposed to various foreign tax rates.\n\u2022Cloud services and subscriptions revenue was $1,535.0 million, up 9.1% compared to the prior fiscal year; up 9.8% after factoring in the unfavorable impact of $9.7 million of foreign exchange rate changes.\n(5)See Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d (discussed later in this MD&A) for definitions and reconciliations of GAAP-based measures to Non-GAAP-based measures.\nSenior Notes 2029\n\nOn February 18, 2020 we issued $900 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.875% Senior Notes due 2028 (Senior Notes 2028) in an unregistered offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to certain non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Senior Notes 2030 and the guarantees will be effectively subordinated to all of the Company, OTHI and the guarantors' existing and future secured debt, including the obligations under the senior credit facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such secured debt.\nSenior Unsecured Fixed Rate Notes\nPlease also see Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2022.\nInterest and other related expense, net is primarily comprised of interest paid and accrued on our debt facilities, offset by interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents.\nOn November 24, 2021, we issued $850 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.875% Senior Notes due 2029 (Senior Notes 2029) in an unregistered offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to certain non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. Senior Notes 2029 bear interest at a rate of 3.875% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1, commencing on June 1, 2022.

Non-GAAP-based gross profit is the arithmetical sum of GAAP-based gross profit and the amortization of acquired technology-based intangible assets and share-based compensation within cost of sales. Non-GAAP-based gross margin is calculated as Non-GAAP-based gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue. Non-GAAP-based income from operations is calculated as GAAP-based income from operations, excluding the amortization of acquired intangible assets, special charges (recoveries), and share-based compensation expense.\n\nAcquisition of Zix Corporation\nReconciliation of selected GAAP-based measures to Non-GAAP-based measures\n\nTerm Loan B\nCash and cash equivalents\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAs of June 30, 2022, we have entered into the following contractual obligations with minimum payments for the indicated fiscal periods as follows:\n(4)Adjustment relates to the exclusion of special charges (recoveries) from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as special charges (recoveries) are generally incurred in the periods relevant to an acquisition and include certain charges or recoveries that are not indicative or related to continuing operations and are therefore excluded from our internal analysis of operating results. See Note 18 Special Charges (Recoveries)\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.\n(6)Adjustment relates to the exclusion of other income (expense) from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as other income (expense) generally relates to the transactional impact of foreign exchange and is generally not indicative or related to continuing operations and is therefore excluded from our internal analysis of operating results. Other income (expense) also includes our share of income (losses) from our holdings in investments as a limited partner. We do not actively trade equity securities in these privately held companies nor do we plan our ongoing operations based around any anticipated fundings or distributions from these investments. We exclude gains and losses on these investments as we do not believe they are reflective of our ongoing business and operating results.\n\u2022Operating cash flow was $981.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2022 compared to $876.1 million in the prior fiscal year, up 12.1%.\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA\n(1)Total revenues by geography are determined based on the location of our direct end customer.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. These temporary differences are measured using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the extent that we consider it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In determining the valuation allowance, we consider factors such as the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected taxable income and the character of income tax assets and tax planning strategies. A change to these factors could impact the estimated valuation allowance and income tax expense.\nIf we experience one of the kinds of change of control triggering events specified in the 2028 Indenture, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes 2028 at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes 2028, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase.\nIn connection with cloud subscription and managed service contracts, we often agree to perform a variety of services before the customer goes live, such as, converting and migrating customer data, building interfaces and providing training. These services are considered an outsourced suite of professional services which can involve certain project-based activities. These services can be provided at the initiation of a contract, during the implementation or on an ongoing basis as part of the customer life cycle. These services can be charged separately on a fixed fee, a time and materials basis, or the costs associated may be recovered as part of the ongoing cloud subscription or managed services fee. These outsourced professional services are considered distinct from the ongoing hosting services and represent a separate performance obligation within our cloud subscription or managed services arrangements. The obligation to provide outsourced professional services is satisfied over time, with the customer simultaneously receiving and consuming the benefits as we satisfy our performance obligations. For outsourced professional services, we recognize revenue by measuring progress toward the satisfaction of our performance obligation. Progress for services that are contracted for a fixed price is generally measured based on hours incurred as a portion of total estimated hours. As a practical expedient, when we invoice a customer at an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of our performance to date, we recognize revenue at that amount.\n\nOther Income (Expense), Net\n(vi)$46.8 million relating to cash used in the repurchase of Common Shares on the open market for potential reissuance under our Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIP) or other stock compensation plans; and\nOur comprehensive Information Management platform and services provide secure and scalable solutions for global companies, SMBs, governments and consumers around the world.

To do this, we bring together our Content Cloud, Business Network Cloud, Experience Cloud, Security Cloud and Developer Cloud. We also accelerate information modernization with intelligent tools and services for moving off paper, automating classification and building clean data lakes for artificial intelligence (AI), analytics and automation.\nCost of Cloud services and subscriptions revenues is comprised primarily of third-party network usage fees, maintenance of in-house data hardware centers, technical support personnel-related costs and some third party royalty costs.\nStandalone selling price\nThe foregoing description of the 2028 Indenture does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2028 Indenture, which is filed as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 18, 2020.\nAs an organization, we are committed to Total Growth\u201d, meaning we strive towards delivering value through organic initiatives, innovations and acquisitions, as well as financial performance. With an emphasis on increasing recurring revenues and expanding our margins, we believe our Total Growth strategy will ultimately drive overall cash flow generation, thus helping to fuel our disciplined capital allocation approach and further our ability to deepen our account coverage and identify and execute strategic acquisitions. With strategic acquisitions, we are well positioned to expand our product portfolio and improve our ability to innovate and grow organically, which helps us to meet our long-term growth targets. We believe our Total Growth strategy is a durable model, that we believe will create both near and long-term shareholder value through organic and acquired growth, capital efficiency and profitability.\nArrangements with multiple performance obligations\nIf these criteria are not met, we determine an appropriate measure of progress based on the nature of our overall promise for the single performance obligation.\n\u2022Total annual recurring revenue, which we define as the sum of cloud services and subscriptions revenue and customer support revenue, was $2,866.0 million, up 4.5% compared to the prior fiscal year; up 5.5% after factoring in the unfavorable impact of $26.0 million of foreign exchange rate changes.\n(2)On December 9, 2021, we redeemed Senior Notes 2026 in full, which resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment of $27.4 million. Of this, $25.0 million related to the early termination call premium, $6.2 million related to unamortized debt issuance costs and ($3.8) million related to unamortized premium (see Note 11 Long-Term Debt\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details). On March 5, 2020, we redeemed\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes\u201d (Topic 740).\nSummary of Results of Operations \nGuarantees and Indemnifications\n\nRevenue recognition\nThese increases in operating cash flows were partially offset by the following decreases:\n\nThe notices of reassessment for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016 would, as drafted, increase our taxable income by approximately $90 million to $100 million for each of those years, as well as impose a 10% penalty on the proposed adjustment to income. Audits by the CRA of our tax returns for fiscal years prior to Fiscal 2012 have been completed with no reassessment of our income tax liability.\nThe components of other income (expense), net were as follows:\nPaaS/ SaaS/ Cloud Subscriptions (collectively referred to here as cloud-based solutions): We offer cloud-based solutions that provide customers the right to access our software through the internet. Our cloud-based solutions represent a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. These services are made available to the customer continuously throughout the contractual period. However, the extent to which the customer uses the services may vary at the customer's discretion. The payment for cloud-based solutions may be received either at inception of the arrangement, or over the term of the arrangement.\nLicense revenue\nAcquisition of Bricata Inc.\n\u2022future expected cash flows of our individual revenue streams;\nBorrowings under Term Loan B are secured by a first charge over substantially all of our assets on a pari passu basis with the Revolver.

Total consideration for Zix was $894.5 million paid in cash, inclusive of $38.3 million of cash acquired and $18.6 million relating to the cash settlement of pre-acquisition vested share-based compensation. We believe the acquisition increases our position in the data protection, threat management, email security and compliance solutions spaces. The results of operations of Zix have been consolidated with those of OpenText beginning December 23, 2021.\n(1)Restricted cash is classified under the Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Other assets line items on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (see Note 9 Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details).\nIn March 2020, COVID-19 was characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The spread of COVID-19 has significantly impacted the global economy and has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our operational and financial performance. The extent of the adverse impact of the pandemic on the global economy and markets will continue to depend, in part, on the length and severity of the measures taken to limit the spread of the virus, the availability, effectiveness and use of treatments and vaccines and on actual and potential resurgences. We are closely monitoring the potential effects and impact on our operations, businesses and financial performance, including liquidity and capital usage, though the extent is difficult to fully predict due to the evolution of this uncertain situation.\n(vii)$0.4 million relating to a cash distribution to non-controlling interests holder.\n(iv)Income taxes.\n\u2022historical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers;\nThe ongoing and ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control.

This was due to a reduction of $27.9 million relating to intangible assets from previous acquisitions becoming fully amortized, partially offset by an increase of $7.7 million relating to amortization of newly acquired customer-based intangible assets from recent acquisitions.\n(v)$12.9 million lower proceeds from the issuance of Common Shares for the exercise of options and the OpenText Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP);\nCloud services and subscriptions revenues increased by $127.6 million or 9.1% during the year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year; up 9.8% after factoring in the unfavorable impact of $9.7 million of foreign exchange rate changes. The increase was primarily driven by the impact of recent acquisitions, along with organic growth over the comparative period. Geographically, the overall change was attributable to an increase in Americas of $107.5 million, an increase in EMEA of $18.6 million and an increase in Asia Pacific of $1.5 million.\nOn December 6, 2021, we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which became effective automatically (the Shelf Registration Statement). The Shelf Registration Statement allows for primary and secondary\nOur professional services, when offered along with software licenses, consist primarily of technical and training services. Technical services may include installation, customization, implementation or consulting services. Training services may include access to online modules, or the delivery of a training package customized to the customer's needs. At the customer's discretion, we may offer one, all, or a mix of these services. Payment for professional services is generally a fixed fee or a fee based on time and materials. Professional services can be arranged in the same contract as the software license or in a separate contract.\nWhen two or more contracts are entered into at or near the same time with the same customer, we evaluate the facts and circumstances associated with the negotiation of those contracts. Where the contracts are negotiated as a package, we will account for them as a single arrangement and allocate the consideration for the combined contracts among the performance obligations accordingly.\n(8)Reconciliation of GAAP-based net income to Non-GAAP-based net income:\ncash tax impact that would primarily occur over a period of several future years based upon annual income realization in Canada. We strongly disagree with the CRA's position for Fiscal 2017 and intend to vigorously defend our original filing position, We are not required to provisionally pay any cash amounts to the CRA as a result of the reassessment in respect of Fiscal 2017 due to the utilization of available tax attributes; however, to the extent the CRA reassesses subsequent fiscal years on a similar basis, we expect to make certain minimum payments required under Canadian legislation, which may need to be provisionally made starting in Fiscal 2024 while the matter is in dispute.\nSenior Notes 2028\n(7)Adjustment relates to differences between the GAAP-based tax provision rate of approximately 52% and a Non-GAAP-based tax rate of approximately 14%; these rate differences are due to the income tax effects of items that are excluded for the purpose of calculating Non-GAAP-based net income. Such excluded items include amortization, share-based compensation, special charges (recoveries) and other income (expense), net. Also excluded are tax benefits/expense items unrelated to current period income such as changes in reserves for tax uncertainties and valuation allowance reserves and book to return\u201d adjustments for tax return filings and tax assessments. Included is the amount of net tax benefits arising from the internal reorganization that occurred in Fiscal 2017 assumed to be allocable to the current period based on the forecasted utilization period. In arriving at our Non-GAAP-based tax rate of approximately 14%, we analyzed the individual adjusted expenses and took into consideration the impact of statutory tax rates from local jurisdictions incurring the expense. The GAAP-based tax provision rate for the year ended June 30, 2021 includes an income tax provision charge from IRS settlements partially offset by a tax benefit from the release of unrecognized tax benefits due to the conclusion of relevant tax audits that was recognized during the second quarter of Fiscal 2021.\nImpacts of Russia-Ukraine Conflict\nCash and cash equivalents primarily consist of balances with banks as well as deposits with original maturities of 90 days or less.\nOn November 24, 2021, OpenText Holdings, Inc.

Since tax law is complex and often subject to varied interpretations, it is uncertain whether some of the Company's tax positions will be sustained upon audit. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes considers current tax laws, our interpretations of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by domestic and foreign tax authorities. While we believe the assumptions and estimates that we have made are reasonable, such assumptions and estimates could have a material impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements upon ultimate resolution of the tax positions.\nTransaction Price Allocation\nfor the year ended June 30, 2022\nCash Dividends\n(1)For more details see Note 11 Long-Term Debt\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe account for our uncertain tax provisions by using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not, based solely on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained on audit, including the resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the appropriate amount of the benefit to recognize. The amount of benefit to recognize is measured as the maximum amount which is more likely than not to be realized. The tax position is derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit. On subsequent recognition and measurement, the maximum amount which is more likely than not to be recognized at each reporting date will represent the Company's best estimate, given the information available at the reporting date, although the outcome of the tax position is not absolute or final. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to liabilities for income taxes within the \"Provision for (recovery of) income taxes\" line of our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nFor a full discussion of all our accounting policies, please see Note 2 Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n(iv)$27.0 million relating to higher cash dividends paid to shareholders;\nCost of Cloud services and subscriptions revenues increased by $29.9 million during the year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year. This was primarily due to an increase in third party network usage fees of $19.9 million, an increase in labour-related costs of $8.1 million and an increase in payroll taxes of $1.5 million. Overall, the gross margin percentage on Cloud services and subscriptions revenues increased to 67% from 66%.\n\nWhen used in this report, the words anticipates\u201d, expects\u201d, intends\u201d, plans\u201d, believes\u201d, seeks\u201d, estimates\u201d, may\u201d, could\u201d, would\u201d, might\u201d, will\u201d and other similar language, as they relate to Open Text Corporation (OpenText or the Company), are intended to identify forward-looking statements under applicable securities laws.

During the year ended June 30, 2022, we made repayments of approximately $16.0 million related to amounts previously deferred. As of June 30, 2022, we have remaining deferrals of $23.0 million which will become payable throughout Fiscal 2023.\nCost of Customer support revenues is comprised primarily of technical support personnel and related costs, as well as third party royalty costs.\nAs of June 30, 2022, we employed a total of approximately 14,800 individuals, of which 7,150 or 49% are in the Americas, 2,720 or 18% are in EMEA and 4,930 or 33% are in Asia Pacific.

A short-form base shelf prospectus qualifying the distribution of such securities was concurrently filed with Canadian securities regulators on December 6, 2021. The type of securities and the specific terms thereof will be determined at the time of any offering and will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement to be filed separately with the SEC and Canadian securities regulators.\nAdditionally, acquisition related costs increased by $1.0 million and other miscellaneous charges increased by $17.0 million, primarily driven by pre-acquisition equity incentives, which upon acquisition were replaced by equivalent value cash settlements (see Note 19 Acquisitions\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements) compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year.\nThe 2028 Indenture contains covenants that limit our and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things: (i) create certain liens and enter into sale and lease-back transactions; (ii) in the case of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, create, assume, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness of the Company or the guarantors without such subsidiary becoming a subsidiary guarantor of Senior Notes 2028; and (iii) consolidate, amalgamate or merge with, or convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of its property and assets substantially as an entirety to, another person. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions as set forth in the 2028 Indenture. The 2028 Indenture also provides for events of default, which, if any of them occurs, may permit or, in certain circumstances, require the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then-outstanding Senior Notes 2028 to be due and payable immediately.\nLitigation\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606 \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" (Topic 606), we account for a customer contract when we obtain written approval, the contract is committed, the rights of the parties, including the payment terms, are identified, the contract has commercial substance and consideration is probable of collection. Revenue is recognized when, or as, control of a promised product or service is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for our products and services (at its transaction price). Estimates of variable consideration and the determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based on readily available information, which may include historical, current and forecasted information, taking into consideration the type of customer, the type of transaction and specific facts and circumstances of each arrangement. We report revenue net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue producing transactions.\nIf all the above criteria are met, we use an input-based measure of progress for recognizing professional service revenue. For example, we may consider total labour hours incurred compared to total expected labour hours. As a practical expedient, when we invoice a customer at an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of our performance to date, we will recognize revenue at that amount.\nThe 2029 Indenture contains covenants that limit our and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things: (i) create certain liens and enter into sale and lease-back transactions; (ii) in the case of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, create, assume, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness of the Company or the guarantors without such subsidiary becoming a subsidiary guarantor of Senior Notes 2029; and (iii) consolidate, amalgamate or merge with, or convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of its property and assets substantially as an entirety to, another person. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions as set forth in the 2029 Indenture. The 2029 Indenture also provides for events of default, which, if any of them occurs, may permit or, in certain circumstances, require the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then-outstanding Senior Notes 2029 to be due and payable immediately.\nAs our professional services do not significantly change the functionality of the license and our customers can benefit from our professional services on their own or together with other readily available resources, we consider professional services distinct within the context of the contract.\n4) Professional Service and Other:\nReconciliation of selected GAAP-based measures to Non-GAAP-based measures\n(5)GAAP-based and Non-GAAP-based income from operations stated in dollars.\nFor information on certain potential tax contingencies, including the CRA matter, see Note 14 Guarantees and Contingencies\u201d and Note 15 Income Taxes\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

The most significant components of these costs are personnel-related expenses, travel costs and third-party subcontracting.\nCost of Customer support revenues decreased by $1.3 million during the year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year. This was primarily due to a decrease in labour-related costs of $1.9 million and a decrease in third party network usage fees of $0.3 million, partially offset by an increase in other miscellaneous costs of $1.0 million. Overall, the gross margin percentage on Customer support revenues remained stable at 91%.\nCloud services and subscriptions revenue are from hosting arrangements where, in connection with the licensing of software, the end user does not take possession of the software, as well as from end-to-end fully outsourced B2B integration solutions to our customers (collectively referred to as cloud arrangements). The software application resides on our hardware or that of a third party, and the customer accesses and uses the software on an as-needed basis. Our cloud arrangements can be broadly categorized as \"platform as a service\" (PaaS), \"software as a service\" (SaaS), cloud subscriptions and managed services.\n1) Cloud Services and Subscriptions:\n(2)Americas consists of countries in North, Central and South America.\n\u2022discount rates.\n\nCash flows provided by operating activities\n__________________________\nIn these cases where a software license is present in a cloud-based solutions arrangement it is assessed to determine if it is distinct from the cloud-based solutions arrangement. The revenue allocated to the distinct software license would be recognized at the point in time the software license is transferred to the customer, whereas the revenue allocated to the hosting performance obligation would be recognized ratably on a monthly basis over the contractual term unless evidence suggests that revenue is earned, or obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern over the contractual term of the arrangement.\n(5)GAAP-based and Non-GAAP-based income from operations stated in dollars.\nDepreciation expenses increased during the year ended June 30, 2022 by $3.0 million compared to the prior fiscal year.\n\nfor the year ended June 30, 2021\n\u2022our promise to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.\nThe CRA has also audited Fiscal 2017 on a basis that we strongly disagree with and are contesting. The focus of the CRA audit has been the valuation of certain intellectual property and goodwill when one of our subsidiaries continued into Canada from Luxembourg in July 2016. In accordance with applicable rules, these assets were recognized for tax purposes at fair market value as of that time, which value was supported by an expert valuation prepared by an independent leading accounting and advisory firm. In conjunction with the Fiscal 2017 audit, the CRA issued a proposal letter dated April 7, 2021 (Proposal Letter) indicating to us that it proposes to reassess our Fiscal 2017 tax year to reduce the depreciable basis of these assets. We have made extensive submissions in support of our position. CRA's position for Fiscal 2017 relies in significant part on the application of its positions regarding our transfer pricing methodology that are the basis for its reassessment of our fiscal years 2012 to 2016 described above, and that we believe are without merit. Other aspects of CRA's position for Fiscal 2017 conflict with the expert valuation prepared by the independent leading accounting and advisory firm that was used to support our original filing position. On January 27, 2022, the CRA issued a notice of reassessment in respect of Fiscal 2017 on the basis of its position set forth in the Proposal Letter. On April 19, 2022, we filed our notice of objection regarding the reassessment in respect of Fiscal 2017. If we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending our position, the estimated impact of the proposed adjustment could result in us recording an income tax expense, with no immediate cash payment, to reduce the stated value of our deferred tax assets of up to approximately $470 million. Any such income tax expense could also have a corresponding\nCustomer support revenue\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(i)$250.0 million relating to higher repayments of our long-term debt and Revolver (as defined below), which is inclusive of $850 million redemption of Senior Notes 2026 (as defined below) during our second quarter of Fiscal 2022, partially offset by $600.0 million repaid on amounts previously drawn on our Revolver in the second quarter of Fiscal 2021;\nOn November 24, 2021, we acquired all of the equity interest in Bricata Inc. (Bricata) for $17.8 million. We believe the acquisition strengthens our OpenText Security Cloud with Network Detection and Response technologies. The results of operations of Bricata have been consolidated with those of OpenText beginning November 24, 2021.", "item_7_text": "Interest and Other Related Expense, Net\nWe have entered into customer agreements which may include provisions to indemnify our customers against third party claims that our software products or services infringe certain third-party intellectual property rights and for liabilities related to a breach of our confidentiality obligations. We have not made any material payments in relation to such indemnification provisions and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnification provisions in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn accordance with business combinations accounting, we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Such valuations may require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Acquired intangible assets typically consist of acquired technology and customer relationships.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nIn summary, the Company believes the provision of supplemental Non-GAAP measures allow investors to evaluate the operational and financial performance of the Company's core business using the same evaluation measures that management uses, and is therefore a useful indication of OpenText's performance or expected performance of future operations and facilitates period-to-period comparison of operating performance (although prior performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance). As a result, the Company considers it appropriate and reasonable to provide, in addition to U.S. GAAP measures, supplementary Non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain items from the presentation of its financial results.\nOur initial public offering was on the NASDAQ in 1996 and we were subsequently listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) in 1998.

Please see Note 11 Long-Term Debt\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.\n(6)Adjustment relates to the exclusion of other income (expense) from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as other income (expense) generally relates to the transactional impact of foreign exchange and is generally not indicative or related to continuing operations and is therefore excluded from our internal analysis of operating results. Other income (expense) also includes our share of income (losses) from our holdings in investments as a limited partner. We do not actively trade equity securities in these privately held companies nor do we plan our ongoing operations based around any anticipated fundings or distributions from these investments. We exclude gains and losses on these investments as we do not believe they are reflective of our ongoing business and operating results.\nThe following tables set forth changes in cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated:\n(7)Adjustment relates to differences between the GAAP-based tax provision rate of approximately 32% and a Non-GAAP-based tax rate of approximately 14%; these rate differences are due to the income tax effects of items that are excluded for the purpose of calculating Non-GAAP-based net income. Such excluded items include amortization, share-based compensation, special charges (recoveries) and other income (expense), net. Also excluded are tax benefits/expense items unrelated to current period income such as changes in reserves for tax uncertainties and valuation allowance reserves and book to return\u201d adjustments for tax return filings and tax assessments. Included is the amount of net tax benefits arising from the internal reorganization that occurred in Fiscal 2017 assumed to be allocable to the current period based on the forecasted utilization period. In arriving at our Non-GAAP-based tax rate of approximately 14%, we analyzed the individual adjusted expenses and took into consideration the impact of statutory tax rates from local jurisdictions incurring the expense.\nIn response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, we have ceased all direct business in Russia and Belarus and with known Russian-owned companies. Sanctions and export controls have also been imposed by the United States, Canada and other countries in connection with Russia's military actions in Ukraine including restrictions on selling or exporting goods, services or technology to certain regions, and travel bans and asset freezes impacting political, military, business and financial organizations and individuals in or connected with Russia. To support certain of our cloud customers headquartered in the United States or allied countries that rely on our network to manage their global business (including their business in Russia), we have nonetheless allowed these customers to continue to use our services to the extent that it can be done in strict compliance with all applicable sanctions and export controls. However, we may adjust our business practices as required by applicable rules and regulations. Our compliance with sanctions and export controls could impact the fulfillment of certain contracts with customers and partners doing business in these affected areas and future revenue streams from impacted parties and certain countries. While we do not expect our decision to cease all direct business in Russia and Belarus and with known Russian-owned companies to have a material adverse effect on our overall business, results of operations or financial condition, it is not possible to predict the broader consequences of this conflict, including adverse effects on the global economy, on our business and operations as well as those of our customers, partners and third party service providers. For more information, please see Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIf we experience one of the kinds of change of control triggering events specified in the 2030 Indenture, OTHI will be required to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes 2030 at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes 2030, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase.\nIncome taxes\nShelf Registration Statement\nWe are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $53.6 million during the year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year, partially as a result of recent acquisitions. Payroll and payroll-related benefits, which is comprised of salaries, benefits and variable short-term incentives, increased by $47.8 million. Additionally, travel and communication expenses increased by $5.8 million, contract labour and consulting increased by $5.3 million and share-based compensation expense increased by $2.5 million. These increases were partially offset by reductions in other miscellaneous costs, which include professional fees such as legal, audit and tax related expenses, of $8.2 million. Overall, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of total revenues, increased to 9% from 8% in the prior fiscal year.\n_________________________________________\nWe will continue to closely monitor the potential impacts of COVID-19, inflation with respect to wages, services and goods, concerns regarding any potential recession, rising interest rates, financial market volatility, and the Russia-Ukraine conflict on our business. See Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA\nWe are committed to continuous innovation. Our investments in R&D push product innovation, increasing the value of our offerings to our installed customer base, which includes Global 10,000 companies (G10K), SMB and consumers. The G10K are the world's largest companies, ranked by estimated total revenues, as well as the world's largest governments and organizations. More valuable products, coupled with our established global partner program, lead to greater distribution and cross-selling opportunities which further help us to achieve organic growth. Over the last three fiscal years, we have invested a cumulative total of $1.23 billion in R&D or 12.3% of cumulative revenue for that three-year period. On an annual basis, we target to spend 12% to 14% of revenues for R&D expense.\nCarbonite vs Realtime Data\n(3)GAAP-based and Non-GAAP-based gross profit stated in dollars and gross margin stated as a percentage of total revenue.\nFor more details on Special charges (recoveries), see Note 18 Special Charges (Recoveries)\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(i)$1.5 billion relating to proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes 2031 and Senior Notes 2029 (both defined below), of which a portion of the net proceeds was used to redeem $850 million of our Senior Notes 2026 (as defined below).\n\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was $1,265.0 million compared to $1,315.0 million in the prior fiscal year.\nThe Company uses these Non-GAAP financial measures to supplement the information provided in its Consolidated Financial Statements, which are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The presentation of Non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be a substitute for financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but rather should be evaluated in conjunction with and as a supplement to such U.S. GAAP measures. OpenText strongly encourages investors to review its financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure. The Company therefore believes that despite these limitations, it is appropriate to supplement the disclosure of the U.S. GAAP measures with certain Non-GAAP measures defined below.\n(i)The customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time without significant penalty; and\nAdditionally, a software license is present in a cloud-based solutions arrangement if all of the following criteria are met:\nCash flows used in investing activities\n\u2022the customer can benefit from the product or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer; and\nThe foregoing description of the 2030 Indenture does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2030 Indenture, which is filed as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 18, 2020.\nCustomer support revenues consist of revenues from our customer support and maintenance agreements. These agreements allow our customers to receive technical support, enhancements and upgrades to new versions of our software products when available. Customer support revenues are generated from support and maintenance relating to current year sales of software products and from the renewal of existing maintenance agreements for software licenses sold in prior periods. Therefore, changes in Customer support revenues do not always correlate directly to the changes in license revenues from period to period. The terms of support and maintenance agreements are typically twelve months, and are renewable, generally on an annual basis, at the option of the customer. Our management reviews our Customer support renewal rates on a quarterly basis, and we use these rates as a method of monitoring our customer service performance. For the year ended June 30, 2022, our Customer support renewal rate was approximately 94%, consistent with the year ended June 30, 2021.\nAcquired intangibles\nSpecial charges (recoveries) typically relate to amounts that we expect to pay in connection with restructuring plans, acquisition-related costs and other similar charges and recoveries. Generally, we implement such plans in the context of integrating acquired entities with existing OpenText operations and most recently in response to our return to office planning. Actions related to such restructuring plans are typically completed within a period of one year. In certain limited situations, if the planned activity does not need to be implemented, or an expense lower than anticipated is paid out, we record a recovery of the originally recorded expense to Special charges (recoveries).\nContingencies\n(6)Adjustment relates to the exclusion of other income (expense) from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as other income (expense) generally relates to the transactional impact of foreign exchange and is generally not indicative or related to continuing operations and is therefore excluded from our internal analysis of operating results. Other income (expense) also includes our share of income (losses) from our holdings in investments as a limited partner. We do not actively trade equity securities in these privately held companies nor do we plan our ongoing operations based around any anticipated fundings or distributions from these investments. We exclude gains and losses on these investments as we do not believe they are reflective of our ongoing business and operating results.\nCash flows used in investing activities increased by $902.2 million, primarily due to consideration paid for acquisitions during Fiscal 2022, which includes cash paid for the acquisitions of Zix of $856.2 million and Bricata of $17.8 million.\nLong-term Debt and Credit Facilities\n__________________________\nSenior Notes 2028 are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by our existing and future wholly-owned subsidiaries that borrow or guarantee the obligations under our existing senior credit facilities. Senior Notes 2028 and the guarantees rank equally in right of payment with all of our and our guarantors' existing and future senior unsubordinated debt and will rank senior in right of payment to all of our and our guarantors' future subordinated debt. Senior Notes 2028 and the guarantees will be effectively subordinated to all of our and our guarantors' existing and future secured debt, including the obligations under the senior credit facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such secured debt.\nShare Repurchase Plan / Normal Course Issuer Bid\nCustomer support revenues decreased by $3.1 million or 0.2% during the year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year; up 1.0% after factoring in the unfavorable impact of $16.3 million of foreign exchange rate changes. Geographically, the overall change was attributable to a decrease in EMEA of $5.9 million and a decrease in Americas of $0.2 million, partially offset by an increase in Asia Pacific of $3.0 million.\nLicense revenues decreased by $26.4 million or 6.9% during the year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year; down 4.6% after factoring in the unfavorable impact of $8.7 million of foreign exchange rate changes. Geographically, the overall change was attributable to a decrease in EMEA of $16.8 million and a decrease in Asia Pacific of $13.8 million, partially offset by an increase in Americas of $4.2 million.\n\n\nSpecial charges (recoveries) increased by $45.1 million during the year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year. This was primarily due to an increase in restructuring activities of $27.2 million related to abandoned facilities and a decrease in comparative period recoveries for the Fiscal 2022 Restructuring Plan, COVID-19 Restructuring Plan and Fiscal 2020 Restructuring Plan.\nThe Fiscal 2021 Repurchase Plan was effected in accordance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act (Rule 10b-18). Purchases made under the Fiscal 2021 Repurchase Plan were subject to a limit of 13,618,774 shares (representing 5% of the Company's issued and outstanding Common Shares as of November 4, 2020). All Common Shares purchased by us pursuant to the Fiscal 2021 Repurchase Plan were cancelled.\n\nassumptions that we believe are reasonable at that time. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates. The policies listed below are areas that may contain key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates and consequently, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Some of these accounting policies involve complex situations and require a higher degree of judgment, either in the application and interpretation of existing accounting literature or in the development of estimates that affect our financial statements. The critical accounting policies which we believe are the most important to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:\nThe TSX approved the Company's notice of intention to commence the Fiscal 2021 NCIB pursuant to which the Company was authorized to purchase Common Shares over the TSX for the period commencing November 12, 2020 until November 11, 2021 in accordance with the TSX's normal course issuer bid rules, including that such purchases were to be made at prevailing market prices or as otherwise permitted. Under the rules of the TSX, the maximum number of Common Shares that could be purchased in this period was 13,618,774 (representing 5% of the Company's issued and outstanding Common Shares as of November 4, 2020), and the maximum number of Common Shares that could be purchased on a single day was 143,424 Common Shares, which was 25% of 573,699 (the average daily trading volume for the Common Shares on the TSX for the six months ended October 31, 2020), subject to certain exceptions for block purchases, subject in any case to the volume and other limitations under Rule 10b-18.\nDuring the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022 our days sales outstanding (DSO) was 43 days compared to a DSO of 44 days during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2021, largely a result of improvement in collections efficiency. The per day impact of our\nCustomer support consists primarily of technical support and the provision of unspecified updates and upgrades on a when-and-if-available basis. Customer support for perpetual licenses is renewable, generally on an annual basis, at the option of the customer. Customer support for term and subscription licenses is renewable concurrently with such licenses for the same duration of time. Payments for customer support are generally made at the inception of the contract term or in installments over the term of the maintenance period. Our customer support team is ready to provide these maintenance services, as needed, to the customer during the contract term. As the elements of customer support are delivered concurrently and have the same pattern of transfer, customer support is accounted for as a single performance obligation. The customer benefits evenly throughout the contract period from the guarantee that the customer support resources and personnel will be available to them, and that any unspecified upgrades or unspecified future products developed by us will be made available. Revenue for customer support is recognized ratably over the contract period based on the start and end dates of the maintenance term, in line with how we believe services are provided.\n(ii)$177.0 million relating to the repurchase and cancellation of 3,809,559 Common Shares under our share repurchase plans authorized on both November 5, 2020 and November 4, 2021 (as discussed below);\nOn December 20, 2016, we issued an additional $250 million in aggregate principal amount by reopening our Senior Notes 2026 at an issue price of 102.75%. The additional notes have identical terms, are fungible with and are a part of a single series with the previously issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes 2026. The outstanding aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes 2026, after taking into consideration the additional issuance, was $850 million as of December 9, 2021.\n\n\u2022Non-GAAP-based net income attributable to OpenText was $876.2 million compared to $927.2 million in the prior fiscal year.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations\nThe foregoing description of the 2031 Indenture does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2031 Indenture, which is filed as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 24, 2021.\n(3)GAAP-based and Non-GAAP-based gross profit stated in dollars and gross margin stated as a percentage of total revenue.\nManaged services: We provide comprehensive B2B process outsourcing services for all day-to-day operations of a customers' B2B integration program. Customers using these managed services are not permitted to take possession of our software and the contract is for a defined period, where customers pay a monthly or quarterly fee. Our performance obligation is satisfied as we provide services of operating and managing a customer's electronic data interchange (EDI) environment. Revenue relating to these services is recognized using an output method based on the expected level of service we will provide over the term of the contract.\nFuture declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to final determination and discretion of the Board.

For each of the periods indicated below, we present our revenues by product type, revenues by major geography, cost of revenues by product type, total gross margin, total operating margin, gross margin by product type and their corresponding percentage of total revenue.\nWe will continue to vigorously contest the adjustments to our taxable income and any penalty and interest assessments, as well as any reduction to the basis of our depreciable property. We are confident that our original tax filing positions were appropriate. Accordingly, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not recorded any accruals in respect of these reassessments or proposed reassessment in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The CRA is currently in preliminary stages of auditing Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2019.\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and payroll-related benefits expenses, contracted research and development expenses and facility costs. Research and development enables organic growth and improves product stability and functionality, and accordingly, we dedicate extensive efforts to update and upgrade our product offerings. The primary drivers are typically software upgrades and development.\n\n(ii)$23.3 million relating to net operating lease assets and liabilities;\nProfessional service and other revenues consist of revenues from consulting contracts and contracts to provide implementation, training and integration services (professional services). Other revenues consist of hardware revenues, which are included within the Professional service and other\u201d category because they are relatively immaterial to our service revenues. Professional services are typically performed after the purchase of new software licenses. Professional service and other revenues can vary from period to period based on the type of engagements as well as those implementations that are assumed by our partner network.\nThe Fiscal 2022 Repurchase Plan has been and will be effected in accordance with Rule 10b-18. Purchases made under the Fiscal 2022 Repurchase Plan are subject to a limit of 13,638,008 shares (representing 5% of the Company's issued and outstanding Common Shares as of October 31, 2021). All Common Shares purchased by us pursuant to the Fiscal 2022 Repurchase Plan have been and will be cancelled.\nOn October 31, 2019, we amended our committed revolving credit facility (the Revolver) to increase the total commitments under the Revolver from $450 million to $750 million as well as to extend the maturity from May 5, 2022 to October 31, 2024. Borrowings under the Revolver are secured by a first charge over substantially all of our assets, on a pari passu basis with Term Loan B. The Revolver has no fixed repayment date prior to the end of the term. Borrowings under the Revolver bear interest per annum at a floating rate of LIBOR plus a fixed margin dependent on our consolidated net leverage ratio ranging from 1.25% to 1.75%. For more information regarding the impact and discontinuance of LIBOR, see Stress in the global financial system may adversely affect our finances and operations in ways that may be hard to predict or to defend against\u201d included within Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2021.\nCash flows from operating activities increased by $105.7 million, due to an increase in net income after the impact of non-cash items of $25.9 million and a increase in changes from working capital of $80.0 million.\nDSO in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021 on our cash flows was $10.0 million and $9.9 million, respectively. In arriving at DSO, we exclude contract assets as these assets do not provide an unconditional right to the related consideration from the customer.\nDepreciation expenses as a percentage of total revenue remained stable for the year ended June 30, 2022 at 3% compared to the prior fiscal year.\nForward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties that may affect forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: (i) actual and potential risks and uncertainties relating to the ultimate geographic spread of COVID-19, the severity of the disease and the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and issues relating to the resurgence of COVID-19 and/or new strains of COVID-19, including potential material adverse effects on our business, operations and financial performance; (ii) actions that have been and may be taken by governmental authorities to contain the COVID-19 pandemic or to treat its impact on our business (or failure to implement additional stimulus programs) and the availability, effectiveness and use of treatments and vaccines (including the effectiveness of boosters); (iii) the actual and potential negative impacts of COVID-19 on the global economy and financial markets; (iv) integration of acquisitions and related restructuring efforts, including the quantum of restructuring charges and the timing thereof; (v) the possibility that we may be unable to successfully integrate the assets we acquire or fail to utilize such assets to their full capacity and not realize the benefits we expect from our acquired portfolios and businesses, including the acquisition of Zix Corporation, (vi) the potential for the incurrence of or assumption of debt in connection with acquisitions and the impact on the ratings or outlooks of rating agencies on our\nAll dollar and percentage comparisons made herein refer to the year ended June 30, 2022 compared with the year ended June 30, 2021, unless otherwise noted. Please refer to Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2021 for a comparative discussion of our Fiscal 2021 financial results as compared to Fiscal 2020.\nAs part of its ongoing audit of our Canadian tax returns, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has disputed our transfer pricing methodology used for certain intercompany transactions with our international subsidiaries and has issued notices of reassessment for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016. Assuming the utilization of available tax attributes (further described below), we estimate our potential aggregate liability, as of June 30, 2022, in connection with the CRA's reassessments for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016, to be limited to penalties, interest and provincial taxes that may be due of approximately $75 million. As of June 30, 2022, we have provisionally paid approximately $34 million in order to fully preserve our rights to object to the CRA's audit positions, being the minimum payment required under Canadian legislation while the matter is in dispute. This amount is recorded within Long-term income taxes recoverable\u201d on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2022.\nIf the SSP is not directly observable, then we estimate the amount using either the expected cost plus a margin or residual approach. Estimating SSP requires judgment that could impact the amount and timing of revenue recognized.

Upon redemption, Senior Notes 2026 were cancelled, and any obligation thereunder was extinguished. The resulting loss of $27.4 million, consisting of $25.0 million relating to the early termination call premium, $6.2 million relating to unamortized debt issuance costs and ($3.8) million relating to unamortized premium, has been recorded as a component of Other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 23 Other Income (Expense), Net\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn addition, any statements or information that refer to expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, objectives, performance or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking, and based on our current expectations, forecasts and projections about the operating environment, economies and markets in which we operate. Forward-looking statements reflect our current estimates, beliefs and assumptions, which are based on management's perception of historic trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors it believes are appropriate in the circumstances. The forward-looking statements contained in this report are based on certain assumptions including the following: (i) countries continuing to implement and enforce existing and additional customs and security regulations relating to the provision of electronic information for imports and exports; (ii) our continued operation of a secure and reliable business network; (iii) the stability of general political, economic and market conditions, including any potential recession; (iv) our ability to manage inflation, including increased labour costs associated with attracting and retaining employees, and rising interest rates; (v) our continued ability to manage certain foreign currency risk through hedging; (vi) equity and debt markets continuing to provide us with access to capital; (vii) our continued ability to identify, source and finance attractive and executable business combination opportunities; (viii) our continued ability to avoid infringing third party intellectual property rights; and (ix) our ability to successfully implement our restructuring plans. Management's estimates, beliefs and assumptions are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies regarding future events and, as such, are subject to change. We can give no assurance that such estimates, beliefs and assumptions will prove to be correct.\nWe strongly disagree with the CRA's positions and believe the reassessments of Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016 (including any penalties) are without merit, and we are continuing to contest these reassessments. On June 30, 2022, we filed a notice of appeal with the Tax Court of Canada seeking to reverse all such reassessments (including any penalties) in full.\nRevenues, Cost of Revenues and Gross Margin by Product Type\nPensions\nCloud services and subscriptions revenues are from hosting arrangements where in connection with the licensing of software, the end user does not take possession of the software, as well as from end-to-end fully outsourced B2B integration solutions to our customers (collectively referred to as cloud arrangements). The software application resides on our hardware or that of a third party, and the customer accesses and uses the software on an as-needed basis via an identified line. Our cloud arrangements can be broadly categorized as PaaS, SaaS, cloud subscriptions and managed services. For the year ended June 30, 2022, our cloud renewal rate, excluding the impact of Carbonite and Zix, was approximately 94% compared to approximately 93% for the year ended June 30, 2021.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nEven if we are unsuccessful in challenging the CRA's reassessments to increase our taxable income for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016, we have elective deductions available for those years (including carry-backs from later years) that would offset such increased amounts so that no additional cash tax would be payable, exclusive of any assessed penalties and interest, as described above.\nOur anticipated payments under our most significant plans, Open Text Document Technologies GmbH (CDT), GXS GmbH (GXS GER), GXS Philippines, Inc.

Geographically, the overall change was attributable to an increase in Americas of $7.1 million and an increase in Asia Pacific of $3.9 million, partially offset by a decrease in EMEA of $1.4 million.\nFor additional details, please see Note 15 \"Income Taxes\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResearch and development expenses increased by $19 million during the year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of recent acquisitions. Payroll and payroll-related benefits, which is comprised of salaries, benefits and variable short-term incentives, increased by $17.1 million. Additionally, share-based compensation expense increased by $7.3 million and contract labour and consulting increased by $2.6 million. These increases were partially offset by reductions in facility-related expenses of $9.1 million. Overall, our research and development expenses, as a percentage of total revenues, remained stable compared to the prior fiscal year at 13%.\nOn August 1, 2019, prior to our acquisition of Carbonite, a purported stockholder of Carbonite filed a putative class action complaint against Carbonite, its former Chief Executive Officer, Mohamad S. Ali, and its former Chief Financial Officer, Anthony Folger, in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts captioned Ruben A. Luna, Individually and on Behalf of All Others Similarly Situated v. Carbonite, Inc., Mohamad S. Ali, and Anthony Folger (No. 1:19-cv-11662-LTS). The complaint alleges violations of the federal securities laws under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The complaint generally alleges that the defendants made materially false and misleading statements in connection with Carbonite's Server Backup VM Edition, and seeks, among other things, the designation of the action as a class action, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, costs and expenses, including counsel fees and expert fees, and other relief as the court deems appropriate. On August 23, 2019, a nearly identical complaint was filed in the same court captioned William Feng, Individually and on Behalf of All Others Similarly Situated v. Carbonite, Inc., Mohamad S. Ali, and Anthony Folger (No. 1:19- cv-11808-LTS) (together with the Luna Complaint, the Securities Actions\u201d). On November 21, 2019, the district court consolidated the Securities Actions, appointed a lead plaintiff, and designated a lead counsel. On January 15, 2020, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended complaint generally making the same allegations and seeking the same relief as the complaint filed on August 1, 2019. The defendants moved to dismiss the Securities Actions on March 10, 2020. The motion was fully briefed in June 2020 and a hearing on the motion to dismiss the Securities Actions was held on October 15, 2020. Following the hearing, on October 22, 2020, the district court granted with prejudice the defendants' motion to dismiss the Securities Actions. On November 20, 2020, the lead plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. On December 21, 2021, the First Circuit issued a decision reversing and remanding the Securities Actions to the district court for further proceedings. The defendants remain confident in their position, believe the Securities Actions are without merit and will continue to vigorously defend the matter.\nIn bundled arrangements, where we have more than one distinct performance obligation, we must allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its relative SSP. However, in certain bundled arrangements, the SSP may not always be directly observable. For instance, in bundled arrangements with license and customer support, we allocate the transaction price between the license and customer support performance obligations using the residual approach because we have determined that the SSP for licenses in these arrangements are highly variable. We use the residual approach only for our license arrangements. When the SSP is observable but contractual pricing does not fall within our established SSP range, then an adjustment is required, and we will allocate the transaction price between license and customer support at a constant ratio reflecting the mid-point of the established SSP range.\nIf these criteria are met, each product or service is separately accounted for as a distinct performance obligation and the total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price (SSP) basis.\n(2)Adjustment relates to the exclusion of amortization expense from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as the timing and frequency of amortization expense is dependent on our acquisitions and is hence excluded from our internal analysis of operating results.\nOur contracts generally contain more than one of the products and services listed above. Determining whether goods and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or as a single performance obligation may require judgment, specifically when assessing whether both of the following two criteria are met:\nAdjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) is consistently calculated as GAAP-based net income, attributable to OpenText, excluding interest income (expense), provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization of acquired intangible assets, other income (expense), share-based compensation and special charges (recoveries).\nCost of License revenues decreased by $0.4 million during the year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year as a result of lower third-party technology costs.

Other factors that may affect forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: (i) the future performance, financial and otherwise, of the Company; (ii) the ability of the Company to bring new products and services to market and to increase sales; (iii) the strength of the Company's product development pipeline; (iv) failure to secure and protect patents, trademarks and other proprietary rights; (v) infringement of third-party proprietary rights triggering indemnification obligations and resulting in significant expenses or restrictions on our ability to provide our products or services; (vi) failure to comply with privacy laws and regulations that are extensive, open to various interpretations and complex to implement including GDPR, California Consumer Privacy Act, California Privacy Rights Act, Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, Colorado Privacy Act, Connecticut Data Privacy Act, Utah Consumer Privacy Act, and Country by Country Reporting (including with respect to transferring personal data outside of the EEA and the United Kingdom, as a result of the ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) that the EU-US Privacy Shield is an invalid data transfer mechanism and that Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) are a valid transfer mechanism unless the country to which personal data is exported restricts the ability to comply with such Clauses (Schrems II), and with respect to the new SCCs published by the European Commission and the IDTA and Addendum published by the United Kingdom's Information Commissioner's Office to meet the requirements of GDPR and Schrems II); (vii) the Company's growth and other profitability prospects; (viii) the estimated size and growth prospects of the Information Management market; (ix) the Company's competitive position in the Information Management market and its ability to take advantage of future opportunities in this market; (x) the benefits of the Company's products and services to be realized by customers; (xi) the demand for the Company's products and services and the extent of deployment of the Company's products and services in the Information Management marketplace; (xii) the Company's financial condition and capital requirements; (xiii) system or network failures or information security, cybersecurity or other data breaches in connection with the Company's offerings or the information technology systems used by the Company generally, the risk of which may be increased during times of natural disaster or pandemic (including COVID-19) due to remote working arrangements; (xiv) failure to achieve our environmental goals on energy consumption, waste diversion and greenhouse gas emissions or our targets relating to ED&I initiatives; and (xv) failure to attract and retain key personnel to develop and effectively manage the Company's business.\nIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company provides certain financial measures that are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP (Non-GAAP). These Non-GAAP financial measures have certain limitations in that they do not have a standardized meaning and thus the Company's definition may be different from similar Non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and/or analysts and may differ from period to period. Thus, it may be more difficult to compare the Company's financial performance to that of other companies. However, the Company's management compensates for these limitations by providing the relevant disclosure of the items excluded in the calculation of these Non-GAAP financial measures both in its reconciliation to the U.S. GAAP financial measures and its Consolidated Financial Statements, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's results.\nThese cloud-based solutions are considered to have a single performance obligation where the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit, and as such we recognize revenue for these cloud-based solutions ratably over the term of the contractual agreement. For example, revenue related to cloud-based solutions that are provided on a usage basis, such as the number of users, is recognized based on a customer's utilization of the services in a given period.\nDuring Fiscal 2022, we closed 122 license contracts greater than $0.5 million, of which 46 contracts were greater than $1.0 million, contributing $131.7 million of License revenues. This was compared to 122 license contracts greater than $0.5 million during Fiscal 2021, of which 45 contracts were greater than $1.0 million, contributing $131.6 million of License revenues.\nThe Company renewed the Fiscal 2022 NCIB in order to provide it with a means to execute purchases over the TSX as part of the overall Fiscal 2022 Repurchase Plan.\n_______________________________\n\u2022the expected use of the acquired assets; and\nWe do not enter into off-balance sheet financing as a matter of practice, except for guarantees relating to taxes and letters of credit on behalf of parties with whom we conduct business.\nCost of Professional service and other revenues increased by $19.7 million during the year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year. This was primarily due to an increase in labour-related costs of $19.4 million and an increase in other miscellaneous costs of $0.3 million. Overall, the gross margin percentage on Professional service and other revenues decreased to 20% from 24%.\nThe effective tax rate decreased to a provision of 23.0% for the year ended June 30, 2022, compared to a provision of 52.2% for the year ended June 30, 2021. Tax expense decreased from $339.9 million during the year ended June 30, 2021 to $118.8 million during the year ended June 30, 2022. This was primarily due to (i) a decrease of $300.6 million related to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) settlements in Fiscal 2021, (ii) a decrease of $37.5 million related to lower net income before taxes, (iii) a decrease of $10.8 million related to passive income from foreign subsidiaries, (iv) a decrease of $9.6 million related to tax accruals on unremitted earnings and (v) a decrease of $8.0 million for base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT). These were partially offset by (i) an increase of $94.3 million for changes in unrecognized tax benefits, (ii) a net increase of $46.8 million related to internal reorganizations and (iii) an increase of $3.5 million for change in valuation allowance. The remainder of the difference was due to normal course movements and non-material items.\n\u2022Enterprise cloud bookings was $465.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2022. We define Enterprise cloud bookings as the total value from cloud services and subscription contracts entered into in the fiscal year that are new, committed and incremental to our existing contracts, excluding the impact of Carbonite and Zix.\nWe continue to conduct business with modifications to employee travel and work locations and also virtualization of certain events, along with modified interactions with customers and suppliers, among other modifications. In addition, as many local governments and officials have started lifting pandemic restrictions in accordance with the guidance of public health experts, in July 2022, we implemented a Flex-Office program in which a majority of our employees work a portion of their time in the office and a portion remotely. See We have implemented a Flex-Office program, which will subject us to certain operational challenges and risks\u201d in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We will continue to actively monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business and geographies, including customer purchasing decisions, and may take further actions that alter our business operations, including our Flex-Office program, as may be required by governments, or that we determine are in the best interest of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers and shareholders. It is uncertain and difficult to predict what the potential effects any such alterations or\nAs of June 30, 2022, our total unfunded pension plan obligations were $63.5 million, of which $2.5 million is payable within the next twelve months. We expect to be able to make the long-term and short-term payments related to these obligations in the normal course of operations.\nTerm Loan B has incremental facility capacity of (i) $250 million plus (ii) additional amounts, subject to meeting a consolidated senior secured net leverage\u201d ratio not exceeding 2.75:1.00, in each case subject to certain conditions. Consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio is defined for this purpose as the proportion of our total debt reduced by unrestricted cash, including guarantees and letters of credit, that is secured by our or any of our subsidiaries' assets, over our trailing twelve months net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, restructuring, share-based compensation and other miscellaneous charges.\n\nCash flows provided by financing activities increased by $1.1 billion. This is primarily due to the net impact of the following activities:\nAmortization of Acquired Technology-based Intangible Assets\n(1)Adjustment relates to the exclusion of share-based compensation expense from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as this expense is excluded from our internal analysis of operating results.\n(iii)Acquired intangibles and\nThe Company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and therefore believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures, which in certain cases adjust for the impact of amortization of intangible assets and the related tax effects that are primarily related to acquisitions, will provide readers of financial statements with a more consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and be more useful in helping readers understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends. Additionally, the Company has engaged in various restructuring activities over the past several years, primarily due to acquisitions and most recently in response to our return to office planning, that have resulted in costs associated with reductions in headcount, consolidation of leased facilities and related costs, all which are recorded under the Company's Special charges (recoveries)\u201d caption on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Each restructuring activity is a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives or circumstances, and each differs in terms of its operational implementation, business impact and scope, and the size of each restructuring plan can vary significantly from period to period. Therefore, the Company believes that the exclusion of these special charges (recoveries) will also better aid readers of financial statements in the understanding and comparability of the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends.\nThe increase in operating cash flow from changes in working capital was primarily due to the net impact of the following increases:\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2022, we repurchased and cancelled 3,809,559 Common Shares for $177.0 million (year ended June 30, 2021 and 2020- 2,500,000 and nil Common Shares for $119.1 million and nil, respectively). Share repurchases during the year ended June 30, 2022 were completed under our share repurchase plans authorized on both November 5, 2020 and November 4, 2021.\nOur cash flows from financing activities generally consist of long-term debt financing and amounts received from stock options exercised by our employees. These inflows are typically offset by scheduled and non-scheduled repayments of our long-term debt financing and, when applicable, the payment of dividends and/or repurchases of our Common Shares.\nOn February 18, 2020 Open Text Holdings, Inc. (OTHI), a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the Company, issued $900 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.125% Senior Notes due 2030 guaranteed by the Company (Senior Notes 2030) in an unregistered offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and to certain non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. Senior Notes 2030 bear interest at a rate of 4.125% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15, commencing on August 15, 2020. Senior Notes 2030 will mature on February 15, 2030, unless earlier redeemed, in accordance with their terms, or repurchased.\nUnder the Revolver, we must maintain a consolidated net leverage\u201d ratio of no more than 4:1 at the end of each financial quarter. Consolidated net leverage ratio is defined for this purpose as the proportion of our total debt reduced by unrestricted cash, including guarantees and letters of credit, over our trailing twelve months net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, restructuring, share-based compensation and other miscellaneous charges.\nOutlook for Fiscal 2023\nOn November 4, 2021, the Board authorized the Fiscal 2022 Repurchase Plan, pursuant to which we may purchase in open market transactions, from time to time over the 12 month period commencing November 12, 2021, up to an aggregate of $350 million of our Common Shares on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the Toronto Stock Exchange (as part of a Fiscal 2022 NCIB) and/or other exchanges and alternative trading systems in Canada and/or the United States, if eligible, subject to applicable law and stock exchange rules. The price that we have paid and will pay for Common Shares in open market transactions has been and will be the market price at the time of purchase or such other price as may be permitted by applicable law or stock exchange rules.\nOur general and administrative labour resources increased by 105 employees, from 1,866 employees at June 30, 2021 to 1,971 employees at June 30, 2022.\n\nIf the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss in accordance with Topic 450-20. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the aggregate of such accrued liabilities was not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations and we do not believe as of the date of this filing that it is reasonably possible that a loss exceeding the amounts already recognized will be incurred that would be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. As described more fully below, we are unable at this time to estimate a possible loss or range of losses in respect of certain disclosed matters.\nAmortization of acquired customer-based intangible assets:\n\nOn February 27, 2017, before our acquisition of Carbonite, a non-practicing entity named Realtime Data LLC (Realtime Data) filed a lawsuit against Carbonite in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas Realtime Data LLC v. Carbonite, Inc. et al (No 6:17-cv-00121-RWS-JDL).\u201d Therein, it alleged that certain of Carbonite's cloud storage services infringe upon certain patents held by Realtime Data. Realtime Data's complaint against Carbonite sought damages in an unspecified amount and injunctive relief. On December 19, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas transferred the case to the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts (No. 1:17-cv-12499). Realtime Data has also filed numerous other patent suits on the same asserted patents against other companies. After a stay pending appeal in one of those suits, on January 21, 2021, the district court held a hearing to construe the claims of the asserted patents. As to the fourth patent asserted against Carbonite, on September 24, 2019, the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office Patent Trial and Appeal Board invalidated certain claims of that patent, including certain claims that had been asserted against Carbonite. The parties then jointly stipulated to dismiss that patent from this action. On August 23, 2021, in one of the suits against other companies, the District of Delaware (No. 1:17-cv-800), held all of the patents asserted against Carbonite to be invalid. Realtime Data has appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. We continue to vigorously defend the matter, and the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts has issued a claim construction order. We anticipate motion practice based upon the result of that order. We have not accrued a loss contingency related to this matter because litigation related to a non-practicing entity is inherently unpredictable. Although a loss is reasonably possible, an unfavorable outcome is not considered by management to be probable at this time and we remain unable to reasonably estimate a possible loss or range of loss associated with this litigation.\n(In thousands, except for per share data)\nIf we experience one of the kinds of change of control triggering events specified in the 2031 Indenture, OTHI will be required to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes 2031 at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes 2031, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase.\nWe may redeem all or a portion of the Senior Notes 2028 at any time prior to February 15, 2023 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes 2028 plus an applicable premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. We may also redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes 2028, on one or more occasions, prior to February 15, 2023, using the net proceeds from certain qualified equity offerings at a redemption price of 103.875% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, subject to compliance with certain conditions. We may, on one or more occasions, redeem the Senior Notes 2028, in whole or in part, at any time on and after February 15, 2023 at the applicable redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the Senior Notes 2028, dated as of February 18, 2020, among the Company, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, The Bank of New York Mellon, as U.S. trustee, and BNY Trust Company of Canada, as Canadian trustee (the 2028 Indenture), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date.\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses and costs associated with advertising, marketing events and trade shows.\nIn valuing our acquired intangible assets, we may make assumptions and estimates based in part on information obtained from the management of the acquired company, which may make our assumptions and estimates inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates we may make in valuing certain of the intangible assets that we acquire include, but are not limited to:\nThe 2031 Indenture contains covenants that limit OTHI, the Company and certain of the Company's subsidiaries' ability to, among other things: (i) create certain liens and enter into sale and lease-back transactions; (ii) in the case of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, create, assume, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness of OTHI, the Company or the guarantors without such subsidiary becoming a subsidiary guarantor of Senior Notes 2031; and (iii) consolidate, amalgamate or merge with, or convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of its property and assets substantially as an entirety to, another person. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions as set forth in the 2031 Indenture. The 2031 Indenture also provides for events of default, which, if any of them occurs, may permit or, in certain circumstances, require the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then-outstanding Senior Notes 2031 to be due and payable immediately.\nCash flows provided by (used in) financing activities\nSenior Notes 2031 are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company and the Company's existing and future wholly-owned subsidiaries (other than OTHI) that borrow or guarantee the obligations under our existing senior credit facilities. Senior Notes 2031 and the guarantees rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company's, OTHI's and the guarantors' existing and future senior unsubordinated debt and will rank senior in right of payment to all of the Company's, OTHI's and the guarantors' future subordinated debt. Senior Notes 2031 and the guarantees will be effectively subordinated to all of the Company's, OTHI's and the guarantors' existing and future secured debt, including the obligations under the senior credit facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such secured debt.\nWe perform a qualitative assessment to test our reporting unit's goodwill for impairment. Based on our qualitative assessment, if we determine that the fair value of our reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than its carrying amount, the quantitative assessment of the impairment test is performed. In the quantitative assessment, we compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired, and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then an impairment loss equal to the difference, but not exceeding the total carrying value of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit, would be recorded.\n\u2022GAAP-based gross margin was 69.6% compared to 69.4% in the prior fiscal year.\nOccasionally, we enter into financial guarantees with third parties in the ordinary course of our business, including, among others, guarantees relating to taxes and letters of credit on behalf of parties with whom we conduct business. Such agreements have not had a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA\nis recognized at the point-in-time when the customer is able to use and benefit from the software, which is normally once software activation keys have been made available for download at the commencement of the term.\nWe have four revenue streams: cloud services and subscriptions, customer support, license and professional service and other.\n(iii)$21.0 million relating to accounts receivable;\nOTHI may redeem all or a portion of the Senior Notes 2031 at any time prior to December 1, 2026 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes 2031 plus an applicable premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. OTHI may also redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes 2031, on one or more occasions, prior to December 1, 2024, using the net proceeds from certain qualified equity offerings at a redemption price of 104.125% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, subject to compliance with certain conditions. OTHI may, on one or more occasions, redeem the Senior Notes 2031, in whole or in part, at any time on and after December 1, 2026 at the applicable redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the Senior Notes 2031, dated as of November 24, 2021, among OTHI, the Company, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, The Bank of New York Mellon, as U.S. trustee, and BNY Trust Company of Canada, as Canadian trustee (the 2031 Indenture), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date.\nOur annual impairment analysis of goodwill was performed as of April 1, 2022. Our qualitative assessment indicated that there were no indications of impairment and therefore there was no impairment of goodwill required to be recorded for Fiscal 2022 (no impairments were recorded for Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, respectively).\n\u2022Non-GAAP-based EPS, diluted, was $3.22 compared to $3.39 in the prior fiscal year.\n(7)Adjustment relates to differences between the GAAP-based tax provision rate of approximately 23% and a Non-GAAP-based tax rate of approximately 14%; these rate differences are due to the income tax effects of items that are excluded for the purpose of calculating Non-GAAP-based net income. Such excluded items include amortization, share-based compensation, special charges (recoveries) and other income (expense), net. Also excluded are tax benefits/expense items unrelated to current period income such as changes in reserves for tax uncertainties and valuation allowance reserves and book to return\u201d adjustments for tax return filings and tax assessments. Included is the amount of net tax benefits arising from the internal reorganization that occurred in Fiscal 2017 assumed to be allocable to the current period based on the forecasted utilization period. In arriving at our Non-GAAP-based tax rate of approximately 14%, we analyzed the individual adjusted expenses and took into consideration the impact of statutory tax rates from local jurisdictions incurring the expense.\nOn December 9, 2021, we redeemed Senior Notes 2026 in full at a price equal to 102.9375% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. A portion of the net proceeds from the offerings of Senior\nFor further details relating to our debt, please see Note 11 Long-Term Debt\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSenior Notes 2031\n\u2022GAAP-based net income attributable to OpenText was $397.1 million compared to $310.7 million in the prior fiscal year.\n(i)$175.4 million relating to income taxes payable, net of receivables;\n(ii)It is feasible for the customer to host the software independent of us.\nIf we experience one of the kinds of change of control triggering events specified in the 2029 Indenture, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes 2029 at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes 2029, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase.\nUnder Term Loan B, we must maintain a consolidated net leverage\u201d ratio of no more than 4:1 at the end of each financial quarter. Consolidated net leverage ratio is defined for this purpose as the proportion of our total debt reduced by unrestricted cash, including guarantees and letters of credit, over our trailing twelve months net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, restructuring, share-based compensation and other miscellaneous charges. As of June 30, 2022, our consolidated net leverage ratio was 2.0:1.\nBased on history, our contracts do not typically contain material rights and when they do, the material right is not significant to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTo the extent that we grant our customer an option to acquire additional products or services in one of our arrangements, we will account for the option as a distinct performance obligation in the contract only if the option provides a material right to the customer that the customer would not receive without entering into the contract. For example, if we give the customer an option to acquire additional goods or services in the future at a price that is significantly lower than the current price, this would be a material right as it allows the customer to, in effect, pay in advance for the option to purchase future products or services. If a material right exists in one of our contracts, then revenue allocated to the option is deferred and we would recognize that deferred revenue only when those future products or services are transferred or when the option expires.\nWe believe our acquisitions support our long-term strategic direction, strengthen our competitive position, expand our customer base, provide greater scale to accelerate innovation, grow our earnings and provide superior shareholder value. We expect to continue to strategically acquire companies, products, services and technologies to augment our existing business. Our acquisitions, particularly significant ones, can affect the period-to-period comparability of our results. See Note 19 Acquisitions\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.\nOur operations are analyzed by management and our chief operating decision maker (CODM) as being part of a single industry segment: the design, development, marketing and sales of Information Management software and solutions. Therefore, our goodwill impairment assessment is based on the allocation of goodwill to a single reporting unit.\nWe are fundamentally integrated into the parts of our customers' businesses that matter, so they can securely manage the complexity of information flow end to end. Through automation and AI, we connect, synthesize and deliver information where it is needed to drive new efficiencies, experiences and insights. We make information more valuable by connecting it to digital business processes, enriching it with capture and analytics, protecting and securing it throughout its entire lifecycle, and leveraging it to create engaging digital experiences. Our solutions also connect large digital supply chains in manufacturing, retail and financial services.\n\n(2)Adjustment relates to the exclusion of amortization expense from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as the timing and frequency of amortization expense is dependent on our acquisitions and is hence excluded from our internal analysis of operating results.\nProfessional service revenue is recognized over time as long as: (i) the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as we perform them, (ii) our performance creates or enhances an asset the customer controls as we perform and (iii) our performance does not create an asset with an alternative use, and we have the enforceable right to payment.\nAs a result of the judgments that need to be made, we obtain the assistance of independent valuation firms. We complete these assessments as soon as practical after the closing dates. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nDepreciation expenses:\n\u2022Total revenue was $3,493.8 million, up 3.2% compared to the prior fiscal year; up 4.3% after factoring in the unfavorable impact of $39.5 million of foreign exchange rate changes.\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and payroll related benefits expenses, related overhead, audit fees, other professional fees, contract labour and consulting expenses and public company costs.\nThe increases in cash flows provided by financing activities were partially offset by the following decreases:\nCustomer support revenue is associated with perpetual, term license and off-cloud subscription arrangements. As customer support is not critical to the customers' ability to derive benefit from their right to use our software, customer support is considered a distinct performance obligation when sold together in a bundled arrangement along with the software.\nOur license revenue can be broadly categorized as perpetual licenses, term licenses and subscription licenses, all of which are deployed on the customer's premises (off-cloud).\n(4)Asia Pacific primarily consists of Japan, Australia, China, Korea, Philippines, Singapore, India and New Zealand.\nOur cash flows used in investing activities is primarily on account of acquisitions and additions of property and equipment.\n(In thousands, except for per share data)\nCRA Matter\nSenior Notes 2026\nQuarterly, we review the status of each significant legal matter and evaluate such matters to determine how they should be treated for accounting and disclosure purposes in accordance with the requirements of ASC Topic 450-20 Loss Contingencies\u201d (Topic 450-20). Specifically, this evaluation process includes the centralized tracking and itemization of the status of all our disputes and litigation items, discussing the nature of any litigation and claim, including any dispute or claim that is reasonably likely to result in litigation, with relevant internal and external counsel, and assessing the progress of each matter in light of its merits and our experience with similar proceedings under similar circumstances.\nSenior Notes 2030\nLooking ahead, the destination for innovation is indisputably the cloud. Businesses of all sizes rely on a combination of public and private clouds, managed services and off-cloud solutions. As a result, we are committed to continue to modernize our technology infrastructure and leverage our existing investments in the OpenText Cloud. The combination of OpenText cloud-native applications and managed services, together with the scalability and performance of our partner public cloud providers, offer more secure, reliable and compliant solutions to customers wanting to deploy cloud-based Information Management applications. The OpenText Cloud is designed to build additional flexibility and scalability for our customers: becoming cloud-native, connecting anything, and extending capabilities quickly with multi-tenant SaaS applications and services.\n(8)Reconciliation of GAAP-based net income to Non-GAAP-based net income:\nWe continue to anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents, as well as available credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund our anticipated cash requirements for working capital, contractual commitments, capital expenditures, dividends and operating needs for the next twelve months. Any further material or acquisition-related activities may require additional sources of financing and would be subject to the financial covenants established under our credit facilities. For more details, see Long-term Debt and Credit Facilities\u201d below.\nOur sales and marketing labour resources increased by 256 employees, from 2,454 employees at June 30, 2021 to 2,710 employees at June 30, 2022.\n(4)Adjustment relates to the exclusion of special charges (recoveries) from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as special charges (recoveries) are generally incurred in the periods relevant to an acquisition and include certain charges or recoveries that are not indicative or related to continuing operations and are therefore excluded from our internal analysis of operating results. See Note 18 Special Charges (Recoveries)\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.\nFiscal 2022 Summary:\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. The carrying amount of goodwill is periodically reviewed for impairment (at a minimum annually) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of this asset may not be recoverable.\nAcquisitions\nSales and marketing expenses increased by $54.9 million during the year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year, partially as a result of recent acquisitions. Payroll and payroll-related benefits, which is comprised of salaries, benefits and variable short-term incentives, increased by $38.6 million. Additionally, marketing expenses increased by $9.6 million, commissions increased by $7.0 million, other miscellaneous costs increased by $4.6 million, share-based compensation expense increased by $4.3 million and travel and communication expenses increased by $3.8 million. These increases were partially offset by reductions in credit loss expense of $9.0 million and reductions in facility-related expenses of $4.0 million. Overall, our sales and marketing expenses, as a percentage of total revenues, increased to 19% from 18% the prior fiscal year.\n(3)EMEA primarily consists of countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\nOur License revenue can be broadly categorized as perpetual licenses, term licenses and subscription licenses. Our License revenues are impacted by the strength of general economic and industry conditions, the competitive strength of our software products and our acquisitions. Cost of License revenues consists primarily of royalties payable to third parties.\nWe will continue to monitor the potential impact of COVID-19 on our financial statements and related disclosures, including the need for additional estimates going forward, which could include costs related to items such as special charges, restructurings, asset impairments and other non-recurring costs. As of June 30, 2022, we have recorded certain estimates in our Consolidated Financial Statements resulting from the pandemic, particularly with respect to the COVID-19 Restructuring Plan, based on management's estimates and assumptions utilizing the most currently available information. Such estimates may be subject to change particularly given the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic. Please also see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAs a result of the continually changing marketplace in which we operate, we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities within our market and at any time may be in various stages of discussions with respect to such opportunities.\nOn May 30, 2018, we entered into a credit facility, which provides for a $1 billion term loan facility with certain lenders named therein, Barclays Bank PLC (Barclays), as sole administrative agent and collateral agent, and as lead arranger and joint bookrunner (Term Loan B) and borrowed the full amount on May 30, 2018 to, among other things, repay in full the loans under our prior $800 million term loan credit facility originally entered into on January 16, 2014. Repayments made under Term Loan B are equal to 0.25% of the principal amount in equal quarterly installments for the life of Term Loan B, with the remainder due at maturity.\nWe believe there are significant assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition as discussed above and these assumptions, judgments and estimates could impact the timing of when revenue is recognized and could have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn addition, we provide Non-GAAP measures for the periods discussed in order to provide additional information to investors that we believe will be useful as this presentation is in line with how our management assesses our Company's performance. See Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below for a reconciliation of GAAP-based measures to Non-GAAP-based measures.\nin full $800 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.625% Senior Notes due 2023 (Senior Notes 2023), which resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment of $17.9 million. Of this, $6.7 million related to unamortized debt issuance costs and the remaining $11.2 million related to the early termination call premium.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The use of the term non-operational charge\u201d is defined for this purpose as an expense that does not impact the ongoing operating decisions taken by the Company's management. These items are excluded based upon the way the Company's management evaluates the performance of the Company's business for use in the Company's internal reports and are not excluded in the sense that they may be used under U.S. GAAP.\nThe 2030 Indenture contains covenants that limit the Company, OTHI and certain of the Company's subsidiaries' ability to, among other things: (i) create certain liens and enter into sale and lease-back transactions; (ii) in the case of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, create, assume, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness of the Company, OTHI or the guarantors without such subsidiary becoming a subsidiary guarantor of Senior Notes 2030; and (iii) consolidate, amalgamate or merge with, or convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of its property and assets substantially as an entirety to, another person. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions as set forth in the 2030 Indenture. The 2030 Indenture also provides for events of default, which, if any of them occurs, may permit or, in certain circumstances, require the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then-outstanding Senior Notes 2030 to be due and payable immediately.\n\nPerpetual licenses: We sell perpetual licenses which provide customers the right to use software for an indefinite period of time in exchange for a one-time license fee, which is generally paid at contract inception. Our perpetual licenses provide a right to use intellectual property (IP) that is functional in nature and have significant stand-alone functionality. Accordingly, for perpetual licenses of functional IP, revenue is recognized at the point-in-time when control has been transferred to the customer, which normally occurs once software activation keys have been made available for download.\nof 4.125% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1, commencing on June 1, 2022.

Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill, if the changes are related to conditions that existed at the time of the acquisition. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments, based on events that occurred subsequent to the acquisition date, are recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe SSP reflects the price we would charge for a specific product or service if it were sold separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. In most cases we are able to establish the SSP based on observable data. We typically establish a narrow SSP range for our products and services and assess this range on a periodic basis or when material changes in facts and circumstances warrant a review.\n\u2022Cash and cash equivalents were $1,693.7 million as of June 30, 2022, compared to $1,607.3 million as of June 30, 2021.\n(8)Reconciliation of GAAP-based net income to Non-GAAP-based net income:\n__________________________\n(i)$51.7 million relating to prepaid expenses and other current assets;\n(1)Represents our share in net income of equity investees, which approximates fair value and subject to volatility based on market trends and business conditions, based on our interest in certain investment funds in which we are a limited partner.

Non-GAAP-based gross profit is the arithmetical sum of GAAP-based gross profit and the amortization of acquired technology-based intangible assets and share-based compensation within cost of sales. Non-GAAP-based gross margin is calculated as Non-GAAP-based gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue. Non-GAAP-based income from operations is calculated as GAAP-based income from operations, excluding the amortization of acquired intangible assets, special charges (recoveries), and share-based compensation expense.\n\nAcquisition of Zix Corporation\nReconciliation of selected GAAP-based measures to Non-GAAP-based measures\n\nTerm Loan B\nCash and cash equivalents\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAs of June 30, 2022, we have entered into the following contractual obligations with minimum payments for the indicated fiscal periods as follows:\n(4)Adjustment relates to the exclusion of special charges (recoveries) from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as special charges (recoveries) are generally incurred in the periods relevant to an acquisition and include certain charges or recoveries that are not indicative or related to continuing operations and are therefore excluded from our internal analysis of operating results. See Note 18 Special Charges (Recoveries)\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.\n(6)Adjustment relates to the exclusion of other income (expense) from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as other income (expense) generally relates to the transactional impact of foreign exchange and is generally not indicative or related to continuing operations and is therefore excluded from our internal analysis of operating results. Other income (expense) also includes our share of income (losses) from our holdings in investments as a limited partner. We do not actively trade equity securities in these privately held companies nor do we plan our ongoing operations based around any anticipated fundings or distributions from these investments. We exclude gains and losses on these investments as we do not believe they are reflective of our ongoing business and operating results.\n\u2022Operating cash flow was $981.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2022 compared to $876.1 million in the prior fiscal year, up 12.1%.\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA\n(1)Total revenues by geography are determined based on the location of our direct end customer.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. These temporary differences are measured using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the extent that we consider it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In determining the valuation allowance, we consider factors such as the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected taxable income and the character of income tax assets and tax planning strategies. A change to these factors could impact the estimated valuation allowance and income tax expense.\nIf we experience one of the kinds of change of control triggering events specified in the 2028 Indenture, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes 2028 at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes 2028, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase.\nIn connection with cloud subscription and managed service contracts, we often agree to perform a variety of services before the customer goes live, such as, converting and migrating customer data, building interfaces and providing training. These services are considered an outsourced suite of professional services which can involve certain project-based activities. These services can be provided at the initiation of a contract, during the implementation or on an ongoing basis as part of the customer life cycle. These services can be charged separately on a fixed fee, a time and materials basis, or the costs associated may be recovered as part of the ongoing cloud subscription or managed services fee. These outsourced professional services are considered distinct from the ongoing hosting services and represent a separate performance obligation within our cloud subscription or managed services arrangements. The obligation to provide outsourced professional services is satisfied over time, with the customer simultaneously receiving and consuming the benefits as we satisfy our performance obligations. For outsourced professional services, we recognize revenue by measuring progress toward the satisfaction of our performance obligation. Progress for services that are contracted for a fixed price is generally measured based on hours incurred as a portion of total estimated hours. As a practical expedient, when we invoice a customer at an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of our performance to date, we recognize revenue at that amount.\n\nOther Income (Expense), Net\n(vi)$46.8 million relating to cash used in the repurchase of Common Shares on the open market for potential reissuance under our Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIP) or other stock compensation plans; and\nOur comprehensive Information Management platform and services provide secure and scalable solutions for global companies, SMBs, governments and consumers around the world.

To do this, we bring together our Content Cloud, Business Network Cloud, Experience Cloud, Security Cloud and Developer Cloud. We also accelerate information modernization with intelligent tools and services for moving off paper, automating classification and building clean data lakes for artificial intelligence (AI), analytics and automation.\nCost of Cloud services and subscriptions revenues is comprised primarily of third-party network usage fees, maintenance of in-house data hardware centers, technical support personnel-related costs and some third party royalty costs.\nStandalone selling price\nThe foregoing description of the 2028 Indenture does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2028 Indenture, which is filed as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 18, 2020.\nAs an organization, we are committed to Total Growth\u201d, meaning we strive towards delivering value through organic initiatives, innovations and acquisitions, as well as financial performance. With an emphasis on increasing recurring revenues and expanding our margins, we believe our Total Growth strategy will ultimately drive overall cash flow generation, thus helping to fuel our disciplined capital allocation approach and further our ability to deepen our account coverage and identify and execute strategic acquisitions. With strategic acquisitions, we are well positioned to expand our product portfolio and improve our ability to innovate and grow organically, which helps us to meet our long-term growth targets. We believe our Total Growth strategy is a durable model, that we believe will create both near and long-term shareholder value through organic and acquired growth, capital efficiency and profitability.\nArrangements with multiple performance obligations\nIf these criteria are not met, we determine an appropriate measure of progress based on the nature of our overall promise for the single performance obligation.\n\u2022Total annual recurring revenue, which we define as the sum of cloud services and subscriptions revenue and customer support revenue, was $2,866.0 million, up 4.5% compared to the prior fiscal year; up 5.5% after factoring in the unfavorable impact of $26.0 million of foreign exchange rate changes.\n(2)On December 9, 2021, we redeemed Senior Notes 2026 in full, which resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment of $27.4 million. Of this, $25.0 million related to the early termination call premium, $6.2 million related to unamortized debt issuance costs and ($3.8) million related to unamortized premium (see Note 11 Long-Term Debt\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details).

These services are made available to the customer continuously throughout the contractual period. However, the extent to which the customer uses the services may vary at the customer's discretion. The payment for cloud-based solutions may be received either at inception of the arrangement, or over the term of the arrangement.\nLicense revenue\nAcquisition of Bricata Inc.\n\u2022future expected cash flows of our individual revenue streams;\nBorrowings under Term Loan B are secured by a first charge over substantially all of our assets on a pari passu basis with the Revolver.

Total consideration for Zix was $894.5 million paid in cash, inclusive of $38.3 million of cash acquired and $18.6 million relating to the cash settlement of pre-acquisition vested share-based compensation. We believe the acquisition increases our position in the data protection, threat management, email security and compliance solutions spaces. The results of operations of Zix have been consolidated with those of OpenText beginning December 23, 2021.\n(1)Restricted cash is classified under the Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Other assets line items on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (see Note 9 Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details).\nIn March 2020, COVID-19 was characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The spread of COVID-19 has significantly impacted the global economy and has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our operational and financial performance. The extent of the adverse impact of the pandemic on the global economy and markets will continue to depend, in part, on the length and severity of the measures taken to limit the spread of the virus, the availability, effectiveness and use of treatments and vaccines and on actual and potential resurgences. We are closely monitoring the potential effects and impact on our operations, businesses and financial performance, including liquidity and capital usage, though the extent is difficult to fully predict due to the evolution of this uncertain situation.\n(vii)$0.4 million relating to a cash distribution to non-controlling interests holder.\n(iv)Income taxes.\n\u2022historical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers;\nThe ongoing and ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control.

This was due to a reduction of $27.9 million relating to intangible assets from previous acquisitions becoming fully amortized, partially offset by an increase of $7.7 million relating to amortization of newly acquired customer-based intangible assets from recent acquisitions.\n(v)$12.9 million lower proceeds from the issuance of Common Shares for the exercise of options and the OpenText Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP);\nCloud services and subscriptions revenues increased by $127.6 million or 9.1% during the year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year; up 9.8% after factoring in the unfavorable impact of $9.7 million of foreign exchange rate changes. The increase was primarily driven by the impact of recent acquisitions, along with organic growth over the comparative period. Geographically, the overall change was attributable to an increase in Americas of $107.5 million, an increase in EMEA of $18.6 million and an increase in Asia Pacific of $1.5 million.\nOn December 6, 2021, we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which became effective automatically (the Shelf Registration Statement). The Shelf Registration Statement allows for primary and secondary\nOur professional services, when offered along with software licenses, consist primarily of technical and training services. Technical services may include installation, customization, implementation or consulting services. Training services may include access to online modules, or the delivery of a training package customized to the customer's needs. At the customer's discretion, we may offer one, all, or a mix of these services. Payment for professional services is generally a fixed fee or a fee based on time and materials. Professional services can be arranged in the same contract as the software license or in a separate contract.\nWhen two or more contracts are entered into at or near the same time with the same customer, we evaluate the facts and circumstances associated with the negotiation of those contracts. Where the contracts are negotiated as a package, we will account for them as a single arrangement and allocate the consideration for the combined contracts among the performance obligations accordingly.\n(8)Reconciliation of GAAP-based net income to Non-GAAP-based net income:\ncash tax impact that would primarily occur over a period of several future years based upon annual income realization in Canada. We strongly disagree with the CRA's position for Fiscal 2017 and intend to vigorously defend our original filing position, We are not required to provisionally pay any cash amounts to the CRA as a result of the reassessment in respect of Fiscal 2017 due to the utilization of available tax attributes; however, to the extent the CRA reassesses subsequent fiscal years on a similar basis, we expect to make certain minimum payments required under Canadian legislation, which may need to be provisionally made starting in Fiscal 2024 while the matter is in dispute.\nSenior Notes 2028\n(7)Adjustment relates to differences between the GAAP-based tax provision rate of approximately 52% and a Non-GAAP-based tax rate of approximately 14%; these rate differences are due to the income tax effects of items that are excluded for the purpose of calculating Non-GAAP-based net income. Such excluded items include amortization, share-based compensation, special charges (recoveries) and other income (expense), net. Also excluded are tax benefits/expense items unrelated to current period income such as changes in reserves for tax uncertainties and valuation allowance reserves and book to return\u201d adjustments for tax return filings and tax assessments. Included is the amount of net tax benefits arising from the internal reorganization that occurred in Fiscal 2017 assumed to be allocable to the current period based on the forecasted utilization period. In arriving at our Non-GAAP-based tax rate of approximately 14%, we analyzed the individual adjusted expenses and took into consideration the impact of statutory tax rates from local jurisdictions incurring the expense. The GAAP-based tax provision rate for the year ended June 30, 2021 includes an income tax provision charge from IRS settlements partially offset by a tax benefit from the release of unrecognized tax benefits due to the conclusion of relevant tax audits that was recognized during the second quarter of Fiscal 2021.\nImpacts of Russia-Ukraine Conflict\nCash and cash equivalents primarily consist of balances with banks as well as deposits with original maturities of 90 days or less.\nOn November 24, 2021, OpenText Holdings, Inc.

Since tax law is complex and often subject to varied interpretations, it is uncertain whether some of the Company's tax positions will be sustained upon audit. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes considers current tax laws, our interpretations of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by domestic and foreign tax authorities. While we believe the assumptions and estimates that we have made are reasonable, such assumptions and estimates could have a material impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements upon ultimate resolution of the tax positions.\nTransaction Price Allocation\nfor the year ended June 30, 2022\nCash Dividends\n(1)For more details see Note 11 Long-Term Debt\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe account for our uncertain tax provisions by using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not, based solely on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained on audit, including the resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the appropriate amount of the benefit to recognize. The amount of benefit to recognize is measured as the maximum amount which is more likely than not to be realized. The tax position is derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit. On subsequent recognition and measurement, the maximum amount which is more likely than not to be recognized at each reporting date will represent the Company's best estimate, given the information available at the reporting date, although the outcome of the tax position is not absolute or final. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to liabilities for income taxes within the \"Provision for (recovery of) income taxes\" line of our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nFor a full discussion of all our accounting policies, please see Note 2 Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n(iv)$27.0 million relating to higher cash dividends paid to shareholders;\nCost of Cloud services and subscriptions revenues increased by $29.9 million during the year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year. This was primarily due to an increase in third party network usage fees of $19.9 million, an increase in labour-related costs of $8.1 million and an increase in payroll taxes of $1.5 million. Overall, the gross margin percentage on Cloud services and subscriptions revenues increased to 67% from 66%.\n\nWhen used in this report, the words anticipates\u201d, expects\u201d, intends\u201d, plans\u201d, believes\u201d, seeks\u201d, estimates\u201d, may\u201d, could\u201d, would\u201d, might\u201d, will\u201d and other similar language, as they relate to Open Text Corporation (OpenText or the Company), are intended to identify forward-looking statements under applicable securities laws.

During the year ended June 30, 2022, we made repayments of approximately $16.0 million related to amounts previously deferred. As of June 30, 2022, we have remaining deferrals of $23.0 million which will become payable throughout Fiscal 2023.\nCost of Customer support revenues is comprised primarily of technical support personnel and related costs, as well as third party royalty costs.\nAs of June 30, 2022, we employed a total of approximately 14,800 individuals, of which 7,150 or 49% are in the Americas, 2,720 or 18% are in EMEA and 4,930 or 33% are in Asia Pacific. Currently, we have employees in 35 countries enabling strong access to multiple talent pools while ensuring reach and proximity to our customers.

A short-form base shelf prospectus qualifying the distribution of such securities was concurrently filed with Canadian securities regulators on December 6, 2021. The type of securities and the specific terms thereof will be determined at the time of any offering and will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement to be filed separately with the SEC and Canadian securities regulators.\nAdditionally, acquisition related costs increased by $1.0 million and other miscellaneous charges increased by $17.0 million, primarily driven by pre-acquisition equity incentives, which upon acquisition were replaced by equivalent value cash settlements (see Note 19 Acquisitions\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements) compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year.\nThe 2028 Indenture contains covenants that limit our and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things: (i) create certain liens and enter into sale and lease-back transactions; (ii) in the case of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, create, assume, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness of the Company or the guarantors without such subsidiary becoming a subsidiary guarantor of Senior Notes 2028; and (iii) consolidate, amalgamate or merge with, or convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of its property and assets substantially as an entirety to, another person. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions as set forth in the 2028 Indenture. The 2028 Indenture also provides for events of default, which, if any of them occurs, may permit or, in certain circumstances, require the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then-outstanding Senior Notes 2028 to be due and payable immediately.\nLitigation\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606 \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" (Topic 606), we account for a customer contract when we obtain written approval, the contract is committed, the rights of the parties, including the payment terms, are identified, the contract has commercial substance and consideration is probable of collection. Revenue is recognized when, or as, control of a promised product or service is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for our products and services (at its transaction price). Estimates of variable consideration and the determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based on readily available information, which may include historical, current and forecasted information, taking into consideration the type of customer, the type of transaction and specific facts and circumstances of each arrangement. We report revenue net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue producing transactions.\nIf all the above criteria are met, we use an input-based measure of progress for recognizing professional service revenue. For example, we may consider total labour hours incurred compared to total expected labour hours. As a practical expedient, when we invoice a customer at an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of our performance to date, we will recognize revenue at that amount.\nThe 2029 Indenture contains covenants that limit our and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things: (i) create certain liens and enter into sale and lease-back transactions; (ii) in the case of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, create, assume, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness of the Company or the guarantors without such subsidiary becoming a subsidiary guarantor of Senior Notes 2029; and (iii) consolidate, amalgamate or merge with, or convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of its property and assets substantially as an entirety to, another person. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions as set forth in the 2029 Indenture. The 2029 Indenture also provides for events of default, which, if any of them occurs, may permit or, in certain circumstances, require the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then-outstanding Senior Notes 2029 to be due and payable immediately.\nAs our professional services do not significantly change the functionality of the license and our customers can benefit from our professional services on their own or together with other readily available resources, we consider professional services distinct within the context of the contract.\n4) Professional Service and Other:\nReconciliation of selected GAAP-based measures to Non-GAAP-based measures\n(5)GAAP-based and Non-GAAP-based income from operations stated in dollars.\nFor information on certain potential tax contingencies, including the CRA matter, see Note 14 Guarantees and Contingencies\u201d and Note 15 Income Taxes\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Please also see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n(v)$1.4 million relating to contract assets.\nFor a detailed discussion on pensions, see Note 12 Pension Plans and Other Post Retirement Benefits\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCost of Professional service and other revenues consists primarily of the costs of providing integration, configuration and training with respect to our various software products. The most significant components of these costs are personnel-related expenses, travel costs and third-party subcontracting.\nCost of Customer support revenues decreased by $1.3 million during the year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year. This was primarily due to a decrease in labour-related costs of $1.9 million and a decrease in third party network usage fees of $0.3 million, partially offset by an increase in other miscellaneous costs of $1.0 million. Overall, the gross margin percentage on Customer support revenues remained stable at 91%.\nCloud services and subscriptions revenue are from hosting arrangements where, in connection with the licensing of software, the end user does not take possession of the software, as well as from end-to-end fully outsourced B2B integration solutions to our customers (collectively referred to as cloud arrangements). The software application resides on our hardware or that of a third party, and the customer accesses and uses the software on an as-needed basis. Our cloud arrangements can be broadly categorized as \"platform as a service\" (PaaS), \"software as a service\" (SaaS), cloud subscriptions and managed services.\n1) Cloud Services and Subscriptions:\n(2)Americas consists of countries in North, Central and South America.\n\u2022discount rates.\n\nCash flows provided by operating activities\n__________________________\nIn these cases where a software license is present in a cloud-based solutions arrangement it is assessed to determine if it is distinct from the cloud-based solutions arrangement. The revenue allocated to the distinct software license would be recognized at the point in time the software license is transferred to the customer, whereas the revenue allocated to the hosting performance obligation would be recognized ratably on a monthly basis over the contractual term unless evidence suggests that revenue is earned, or obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern over the contractual term of the arrangement.\n(5)GAAP-based and Non-GAAP-based income from operations stated in dollars.\nDepreciation expenses increased during the year ended June 30, 2022 by $3.0 million compared to the prior fiscal year.\n\nfor the year ended June 30, 2021\n\u2022our promise to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.\nThe CRA has also audited Fiscal 2017 on a basis that we strongly disagree with and are contesting. The focus of the CRA audit has been the valuation of certain intellectual property and goodwill when one of our subsidiaries continued into Canada from Luxembourg in July 2016. In accordance with applicable rules, these assets were recognized for tax purposes at fair market value as of that time, which value was supported by an expert valuation prepared by an independent leading accounting and advisory firm. In conjunction with the Fiscal 2017 audit, the CRA issued a proposal letter dated April 7, 2021 (Proposal Letter) indicating to us that it proposes to reassess our Fiscal 2017 tax year to reduce the depreciable basis of these assets. We have made extensive submissions in support of our position. CRA's position for Fiscal 2017 relies in significant part on the application of its positions regarding our transfer pricing methodology that are the basis for its reassessment of our fiscal years 2012 to 2016 described above, and that we believe are without merit. Other aspects of CRA's position for Fiscal 2017 conflict with the expert valuation prepared by the independent leading accounting and advisory firm that was used to support our original filing position. On January 27, 2022, the CRA issued a notice of reassessment in respect of Fiscal 2017 on the basis of its position set forth in the Proposal Letter. On April 19, 2022, we filed our notice of objection regarding the reassessment in respect of Fiscal 2017. If we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending our position, the estimated impact of the proposed adjustment could result in us recording an income tax expense, with no immediate cash payment, to reduce the stated value of our deferred tax assets of up to approximately $470 million. Any such income tax expense could also have a corresponding\nCustomer support revenue\nItem 7.
