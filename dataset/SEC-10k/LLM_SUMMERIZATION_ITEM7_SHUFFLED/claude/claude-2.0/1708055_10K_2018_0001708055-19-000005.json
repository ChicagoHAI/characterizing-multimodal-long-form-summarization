Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nWe are a leading provider of next generation (\"NextGen\") software solutions to telecommunications, wireless and cable service providers and enterprises across industry verticals. With over 1,000 customers around the globe, including some of the largest telecommunications service providers and enterprises in the world, we enable service providers and enterprises to modernize their communications networks through software and provide secure RTC solutions to their customers and employees. By securing and enabling reliable and scalable IP networks, we help service providers and enterprises adopt the next generation of software-based virtualized and cloud communications technologies for service providers to drive new, incremental revenue while protecting their existing revenue streams. Our software solutions provide a secure way for our customers to connect and leverage multivendor, multiprotocol communications systems and applications across their networks and the cloud, around the world and in a rapidly changing ecosystem of IP-enabled devices, such as smartphones and tablets. In addition, our software solutions secure cloud-based delivery of UC solutions - both for service providers transforming to a cloud-based network and for enterprises using cloud-based UC. We sell our software solutions through both direct sales and indirect channels globally, leveraging the assistance of resellers, and we provide ongoing support to our customers through a global services team with experience in design, deployment and maintenance of some of the world's largest software IP networks.\nBusiness Acquisitions\nEdgewater Networks, Inc.\nOn August 3, 2018 (the \"Edgewater Acquisition Date\"), we completed our acquisition of Edgewater Networks, Inc. (\"Edgewater\"), a private company headquartered in San Jose, California (the \"Edgewater Acquisition\"). Edgewater is a market leader in Network Edge Orchestration for the small and medium enterprise and UC market. We believe that the acquisition of Edgewater will allow us to offer our global customer base a complete core-to-edge product portfolio, end-to-end service assurance and analytics solutions, and a fully integrated SD-WAN service.\nAs consideration for the Edgewater Acquisition, we paid, in the aggregate, approximately $46 million of cash, net of cash acquired, and issued 4.2 million shares of Ribbon common stock to Edgewater's selling shareholders and holders of vested in-the-money options and warrants to acquire common stock of Edgewater (the \"Edgewater Selling Stakeholders\") on the Edgewater Acquisition Date. The cash payment was funded through our existing credit facility. We had previously agreed to pay the Edgewater Selling Stakeholders an additional $30 million of cash, $15 million of which was to be paid six months from the Edgewater Acquisition Date and the other $15 million of which was to be paid as early as nine months from the Edgewater Acquisition Date and no later than 18 months from the Edgewater Acquisition Date (the exact timing of which would depend on the amount of revenue generated from the sales of Edgewater products in 2018) (the \"Edgewater Deferred Consideration\"). On February 15, 2019, we and the Edgewater Selling Stakeholders agreed to reduce the amount of Edgewater Deferred Consideration from $30 million to $21.9 million and agreed that all such deferred consideration will be payable on March 8, 2019.\nThe Edgewater Acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination and the financial results of Edgewater have been included in our consolidated financial statements for the period subsequent to the Edgewater Acquisition Date.\nGENBAND\nOn October 27, 2017 (the \"Merger Date\"), Sonus Networks, Inc. (\"Sonus\") consummated an acquisition as specified in an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d) with Solstice Sapphire Investments, Inc. (\"NewCo\") and certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, GENBAND Holdings Company, GENBAND Inc. and GENBAND II, INC. (collectively, \"GENBAND\") such that, following a series of mergers (collectively, the \"Merger\"), Sonus and GENBAND each became a wholly-owned subsidiary of NewCo.\nAs a result of the Merger, we believe we are better positioned to enable network transformations to IP and to cloud-based networks for service providers and enterprise customers worldwide, with a broader and deeper sales footprint, increased ability to invest in growth, more efficient and effective research and development, and a comprehensive RTC product offering.\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, NewCo issued 50.9 million shares to the GENBAND equity holders, with the number of shares issued in the aggregate to the GENBAND equity holders equal to the number of shares of Sonus common stock\noutstanding immediately prior to the closing date of the Merger, such that former stockholders of Sonus would own approximately 50%, and former shareholders of GENBAND and the two related holding companies would own approximately 50%, of the shares of NewCo common stock issued and outstanding immediately following the consummation of the Merger.\nThe Merger has been accounted for as a business combination and the financial results of GENBAND have been included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on the Merger Date. On November 28, 2017, the Company changed its name to \"Ribbon Communications Inc.\"\nTaqua, LLC\nOn September 26, 2016 (the \"Taqua Acquisition Date\"), we acquired Taqua, LLC (\"Taqua\"), a leading supplier of IP communications systems, applications and services to mobile and fixed operators. Taqua enables the transformation of software-based service provider networks to deliver next-generation voice, video and messaging services, including VoIP, VoWiFi and VoLTE. The financial results of Taqua are included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on the Taqua Acquisition Date.\nAnova Data, Inc.\nOn February 28, 2019, we acquired the business and technology assets of Anova Data, Inc. (\"Anova\"), a provider of advanced analytics solutions, for total purchase consideration of 3.3 million shares of our common stock. Anova is based in the U.S., and its NextGen products provide a cloud-native, streaming analytics platform for network and subscriber optimization and monetization. We believe that the proposed acquisition reinforces and extends our strategy to expand into network optimization, security and data monetization via big data analytics and machine learning. We do not expect that the acquisition will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in 2019.\nFinancial Overview\nFinancial Results\nWe reported losses from operations of approximately $65 million for 2018, $55 million for 2017 and $14 million for 2016. We reported net losses of approximately $77 million for 2018, $35 million for 2017 and $14 million for 2016.\nOur revenue was approximately $578 million in 2018, $330 million in 2017 and $253 million in 2016. Our gross profit was approximately $308 million in 2018, $201 million in 2017 and $168 million in 2016. Our gross profit as a percentage of revenue (\"total gross margin\") was approximately 53% in 2018, 61% in 2017 and 66% in 2016.\nOur operating expenses were approximately $374 million in 2018, compared to approximately $257 million in 2017 and approximately $181 million in 2016.\nOur 2018 operating expenses included approximately $17 million of acquisition- and integration-related expenses, primarily related to the Merger and, to a lesser extent, to the recent acquisition of Edgewater, and approximately $17 million of restructuring expense, primarily related to severance and related costs.\nOur 2017 operating expenses included approximately $15 million of acquisition- and integration-related expenses, nearly all related to the Merger, and approximately $9 million of restructuring expense. Our 2017 restructuring expense was primarily related to severance and related costs.\nOur 2016 operating expenses included approximately $1 million of acquisition- and integration-related costs for professional and services fees related to our acquisition of Taqua and approximately $3 million of restructuring expense. Our 2016 restructuring expense was primarily related to severance and related costs.\nWe recorded stock-based compensation expense of approximately $11 million in 2018, $26 million in 2017 and $20 million in 2016. The expense recorded in 2017 includes approximately $9 million of incremental expense related to the acceleration of stock options and certain full value stock awards in connection with the Merger.\nSee \"Results of Operations\" in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") for additional discussion of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nRestructuring and Cost Reduction Initiatives\nIn connection with the Merger, we implemented a restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of 2017 to eliminate certain redundant positions and facilities within the combined companies (the \"Merger Restructuring Initiative\"). We recorded approximately $16 million of restructuring expense related to the Merger Restructuring Initiative in 2018, comprised of approximately $15 million for severance and related expenses and approximately $1 million in connection with redundant facilities located in the Czech Republic, Canada and the U.S. We recorded approximately $9 million of restructuring expense for severance and related expenses in 2017 related to the Merger Restructuring Initiative. We anticipate that we will record additional future expense in connection with this initiative for headcount and redundant facilities aggregating approximately $5 million. We believe that the severance payments currently accrued will be completed in 2019 and that the payments related to redundant facilities will be completed in 2029, when the last of the leases for these restructured facilities expires. We are actively seeking to sublease each of these facilities.\nWe assumed GENBAND's restructuring liability aggregating approximately $4 million at the Merger Date (the \"GENBAND Restructuring Initiative\"), primarily related to headcount reductions. In 2018, we recorded approximately $1 million of restructuring expense for changes in estimated costs for previously recorded initiatives, primarily changes in negotiated severance to employees in certain international locations and changes in estimated sublease income for restructured facilities. We do not expect to record additional expense in connection with this initiative except for adjustments for changes in estimated costs. We believe that the payments will be completed in 2020, when the lease for this restructured facility expires.\nOn July 25, 2016, we announced a program (the \"2016 Restructuring Initiative\") to further accelerate our investment in new technologies as the communications industry migrates to a cloud-based architecture and pursues new strategic initiatives, such as new products and an expanded go-to-market footprint in selected geographies and discrete vertical markets. We have recorded an aggregate of approximately $2 million of restructuring expense in connection with this initiative, primarily for severance and related costs. The amounts accrued for severance and related costs were fully paid in 2017. We expect that the amounts accrued for facilities will be paid by the end of 2019.\nIn connection with the acquisition of Taqua, we implemented a restructuring plan in the third quarter of 2016 to eliminate certain redundant positions within the combined companies. On October 24, 2016, the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors (the \"Audit Committee\") approved a broader Taqua restructuring plan related to headcount and redundant facilities (collectively, the \"Taqua Restructuring Initiative\"). In connection with this initiative, we have recorded approximately $2 million of restructuring expense for severance and related costs and estimated costs related to the elimination of redundant facilities, including adjustments recorded for changes in cost estimates for the planned restructuring activities. The actions under the Taqua Restructuring Initiative have been implemented and accordingly, we do not expect to record additional expense in connection with this initiative. The amounts accrued for severance and related costs were fully paid by the end of the third quarter of 2017. We expect that the amounts accrued for facilities costs will be paid in 2019.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from management's estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. The significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical include revenue recognition, the valuation of inventory, loss contingencies and reserves, stock-based compensation, business combinations, goodwill and intangible assets, and accounting for income taxes.\nRevenue Recognition. We account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASC 606\"), which we adopted on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method.\nWe derive revenue from two primary sources: products (software and non-software products) and services. Software and non-software product revenue is generated from sales of our software with proprietary appliances that function together to deliver the products' essential functionality. Software and appliances are also sold on a standalone basis. Services include customer support (software updates and technical support), consulting, design services, installation services and training. A\ntypical contract includes both product and services. Generally, contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. SSPs are typically estimated based on observable transactions when these services are sold on a standalone basis.\nThe software licenses typically provide a perpetual right to use our software. We also sell term-based software licenses that expire and Software-as-as-Service (\"SaaS\")-based software which are referred to as subscription arrangements. We do not customize our software nor are installation services required, as the customer has a right to utilize internal resources or a third-party service company. The software and appliances are delivered before related services are provided and are functional without professional services or customer support. We have concluded that our software licenses are functional intellectual property that are distinct, as the user can benefit from the software on its own. The product revenue is typically recognized upon transfer of control or when the software is made available for download, as this is the point that the user of the software can direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the functional intellectual property. We do not recognize software revenue related to the renewal of subscription software licenses earlier than the beginning of the subscription period. Appliance products are generally sold with software to provide the customer solution.\nService revenue includes revenue from customer support and other professional services. We offer warranties on our products. Certain of our warranties are considered to be assurance-type in nature and do not cover anything beyond ensuring that the product is functioning as intended. Based on the guidance in ASC 606, assurance-type warranties do not represent separate performance obligations. We also sell separately-priced maintenance service contracts which qualify as service-type warranties and represent separate performance obligations. We do not allow and have no history of accepting product returns.\nCustomer support includes software updates on a when-and-if-available basis, telephone support, integrated web-based support and bug fixes or patches. We sell our customer support contracts at a percentage of list or net product price related to the support. Customer support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the customer support agreement, which is typically one year.\nOur professional services include consulting, technical support, resident engineer services, design services and installation services. Because control transfers over time, revenue is recognized based on progress toward completion of the performance obligation. The method to measure progress toward completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. We generally use the input method to measure progress for our contracts because we believe it best depicts the transfer of assets to the customer which occurs as we incur costs for the contracts. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the progress toward completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. When the measure of progress is based upon expended labor, progress toward completion is measured as the ratio of labor time expended to date versus the total estimated labor time required to complete the performance obligation. Revenue is recorded proportionally as costs are incurred or as labor is expended. Costs to fulfill these obligations include internal labor as well as subcontractor costs.\nWe offer customer training courses, for which the related revenue is typically recognized as the training services are performed.\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to the customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment.\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, the Company may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\nValuation of Inventory. We review inventory for both potential obsolescence and potential loss of value periodically. In this review, we make assumptions about the future demand for and market value of the inventory and, based on these assumptions, estimate the amount of any excess, obsolete or slow-moving inventory.\nWe write down our inventories if they are considered to be obsolete or at levels in excess of forecasted demand. In these cases, inventory is written down to estimated realizable value based on historical usage and expected demand. Inherent in our estimates of market value in determining inventory valuation are estimates related to economic trends, future demand for our products and technical obsolescence of our products. If future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our\nprojections, additional inventory write-downs could be required and would be reflected in the cost of revenue in the period the revision is made. To date, we have not been required to revise any of our assumptions or estimates used in determining our inventory valuations.\nWe write down our evaluation equipment at the time of shipment to our customers, as it is not probable that the inventory value will be realizable.\nLoss Contingencies and Reserves. We are subject to ongoing business risks arising in the ordinary course of business that affect the estimation process of the carrying value of assets, the recording of liabilities and the possibility of various loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to determine whether such amounts should be adjusted and record changes in estimates in the period they become known. We are subject to various legal claims. We reserve for legal contingencies and legal fees when the amounts are probable and reasonably estimable.\nStock-Based Compensation. Our stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period.\nWe use the Black-Scholes valuation model for estimating the fair value on the date of grant of employee stock options. Determining the fair value of stock option awards at the grant date requires judgment regarding certain valuation assumptions, including the volatility of our stock price, expected term of the option, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. Changes in such assumptions and estimates could result in different fair values and could therefore impact our earnings. Such changes, however, would not impact our cash flows. The fair value of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance-based awards is based upon our stock price on the grant date.\nWe grant performance-based stock units, some of which include a market condition, to certain of our executives. We use a Monte Carlo simulation approach to model future stock price movements based upon the risk-free rate of return, the volatility of each entity, and the pair-wise covariance between each entity. These results are then used to calculate the grant date fair values of the performance-based stock units.\nThe amount of stock-based compensation expense recorded in any period for unvested awards requires estimates of the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited prior to vesting, as well as assumptions regarding the probability that performance-based stock awards without market conditions will be earned.\nBusiness Combinations. We allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed and represents the expected future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in the business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. Significant management judgments and assumptions are required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, particularly acquired intangible assets which are principally based upon estimates of the future performance and cash flows expected from the acquired business and applied discount rates. While we use our best estimates and assumptions as part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at a business combination date, our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. If different assumptions are used, it could materially impact the purchase price allocation and our financial position and results of operations. Any adjustments to assets acquired or liabilities assumed subsequent to the purchase price allocation period are included in operating results in the period in which the adjustments are determined. Intangible assets typically are comprised of in-process research and development, developed technology, customer relationships, trade names and internal use software.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. Intangible assets with estimated lives and other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of intangible assets with estimated lives and other long-lived assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to future net undiscounted pretax cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If these comparisons indicate that an asset is not recoverable, we will recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the related estimated fair value.\nJudgment is required in determining whether an event has occurred that may impair the value of goodwill or identifiable intangible or other long-lived assets. Factors that could indicate an impairment may exist include significant underperformance\nrelative to plan or long-term projections, strategic changes in business strategy, significant negative industry or economic trends, a significant change in circumstances relative to a large customer, a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and a decline in our market capitalization to below net book value. We must make assumptions about future control premiums, market comparables, cash flows, operating plans, discount rates and other factors to determine recoverability.\nOur annual testing for impairment of goodwill is completed as of November 30. We operate as a single operating segment with one reporting unit and consequently we evaluate goodwill for impairment based on an evaluation of the fair value of the Company as a whole. We performed our step one assessments for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 and determined each year that our fair value was in excess of our carrying value and accordingly, there was no impairment of goodwill. At certain times during 2018, including at our annual testing date of November 30, 2018, our market capitalization was below our book value. While we have concluded that the fair value exceeds carrying value at that date, we regularly monitor for changes in circumstances, including changes to our projections regarding performance of the business, that could result in impairment of goodwill.\nAccounting for Income Taxes. Our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion. The current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for 2018. We provide for deferred income taxes resulting from temporary differences between financial and taxable income. Such differences arise primarily from tax net operating loss (\"NOL\") and credit carryforwards, depreciation, deferred revenue, stock-based compensation expense, accruals and reserves.\nWe assess the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary valuation allowances as required. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative income in the most recent years, changes in the business in which we operate and our forecast of future taxable income. In determining future taxable income, we are responsible for assumptions utilized, including the amount of state, federal and international pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage our underlying businesses. Such assessment is completed on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had valuation allowances of approximately $82 million to offset net domestic deferred tax assets of approximately $83 million. In addition, we had valuation allowances to offset Canada federal credits carryovers of approximately $10 million and Ireland net deferred tax assets of $10 million. In the event we determine it is more likely than not that we will be able to use a deferred tax asset in the future in excess of its net carrying value, the valuation allowance would be reduced, thereby increasing net earnings and increasing equity in the period such determination is made. We have recorded net deferred tax assets in some of our international subsidiaries. These amounts could change in future periods based upon our operating results and changes in tax law.\nWe provide for income taxes during interim periods based on the estimated effective tax rate for the full year. We record a cumulative adjustment to the tax provision in an interim period in which a change in the estimated annual effective tax rate is determined.\nWe have provided for income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 31, 2018, with the exception of the Company's Irish subsidiary, as we do not plan to permanently reinvest these amounts outside the U.S. The repatriation of the undistributed earnings would result in withholding taxes imposed on the repatriation. Consequently, we have recorded a tax liability of $4.5 million, consisting of potential withholding and distribution taxes related to undistributed earnings from these subsidiaries as of December 31, 2018. Had the earnings of the Irish subsidiary been determined to not be permanently reinvested outside the U.S., no additional deferred tax liability would be required due to no withholding taxes or income tax expense being imposed on such repatriation.\nWe assess all material positions taken in any income tax return, including all significant uncertain positions, in all tax years that are still subject to assessment or challenge by relevant taxing authorities. Assessing an uncertain tax position begins with the initial determination of the position's sustainability and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. As of each balance sheet date, unresolved uncertain tax positions must be reassessed, and we will determine whether (i) the factors underlying the sustainability assertion have changed and (ii) the amount of recognized tax benefit is still appropriate. The recognition and measurement of tax benefits require significant judgment. Judgments concerning the recognition and measurement of a tax benefit might change as new information becomes available.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to: reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%; requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries; generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; requiring a current inclusion in U.S. federal taxable income of certain earnings (Global Intangible Low-taxed Income) (\"GILTI\") of controlled foreign corporations; eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (\"AMT\") and changing how existing AMT credits can be realized; creating the base erosion anti-abuse tax; creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense; changing rules related to uses and limitations of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017; providing a tax deduction for foreign-derived intangible income; and changing rules related to deductibility of compensation for certain officers.\nWe completed our accounting for the effects of the Tax Act in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the effects of the Tax Act were reflected in in our 2018 tax provision. We considered the impact of the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (\"BEAT\"), the GILTI, the deduction for foreign derived intangible income and other provisions of the Tax Act when preparing our 2018 tax provision. Based on this analysis, we recorded BEAT tax expense of $0.4 million in 2018 and recorded an adjustment to the provisional amounts previously recorded related to the Tax Act that decreased our deferred tax assets by $0.2 million.\nResults of Operations\nYears Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nRevenue. Revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was as follows (in millions, except percentages):\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\nfrom prior year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>279.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>181.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service\n</td> <td>298.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>577.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>329.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>248.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur product revenue is generated from sales of software with attached appliances, software licenses and software subscription fees. Certain of our products may be included in more than one of our solutions (session solutions, network transformation solutions, and applications and security solutions), dependent upon the configuration of the individual customer solutions sold. Our software with attached appliances and software license revenues are primarily comprised of our media gateway, call controller, signaling, virtual mobile core and management (i.e., analytics, assurance, billing, etc.) products. Our software subscription fees revenue is primarily comprised of sales of our UC-related (i.e., application server, media server, etc.), Kandy Cloud and Ribbon Protect products. All three of our solutions portfolios address both the service provider and enterprise markets and are sold through both our direct sales program and from indirect sales through our channel partner program.\nOur product revenue increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the inclusion of GENBAND's product revenue for the full year in 2018 compared to the inclusion of two months of GENBAND's product revenue in 2017. Product revenue from sales of our software with attached appliances and software licenses contributed approximately $85 million in the aggregate to the increase in our product revenue in 2018, coupled with approximately $13 million of higher 2018 product revenue from sales of our software subscriptions.\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2018, approximately 21% of our product revenue was attributable to sales to enterprise customers, compared to approximately 20% in 2017. These sales were made through both our direct sales team and indirect sales channel partners.\nIn 2018, approximately 25% of our product revenue was from indirect sales through our channel partner program, compared to approximately 24% in 2017.\nThe timing of the completion of customer projects and revenue recognition criteria satisfaction may cause our product revenue to fluctuate from one period to the next.\nService revenue is primarily comprised of appliance and software maintenance and support ( maintenance revenue\u201d) and network design, installation and other professional services ( professional services revenue\u201d).\nService revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was comprised of the following (in millions, except\npercentages):\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\nfrom prior year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>234.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional services\n</td> <td>64.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total service revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>298.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>148.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur maintenance revenue increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the inclusion of GENBAND maintenance revenue for the full year in 2018 compared to the inclusion of two months of GENBAND maintenance revenue in 2017.\nThe increase in our professional services revenue in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the inclusion of GENBAND professional services revenue for the full year in 2018 compared to the inclusion of two months of GENBAND professional services revenue in 2017.\nThe following customer contributed 10% or more of our revenue in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Verizon Communications Inc.\n</td> <td>17%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue earned from customers domiciled outside the United States was approximately 42% of revenue in 2018 and approximately 34% of revenue in 2017. Due to the timing of project completions, we expect that the domestic and international components as a percentage of our revenue may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year.\nOur deferred product revenue was approximately $14 million at December 31, 2018 and approximately $22 million at December 31, 2017. Our deferred service revenue was approximately $108 million at December 31, 2018 and approximately $93 million at December 31, 2017. Our deferred revenue balance may fluctuate as a result of the timing of revenue recognition, customer payments, maintenance contract renewals, contractual billing rights and maintenance revenue deferrals included in multiple element arrangements.\nWe expect that our product revenue in 2019 will increase compared with 2018 levels, primarily due to the inclusion of revenue attributable to our acquisition of Edgewater.\nWe expect that our service revenue in 2019 will increase compared with 2018 levels, primarily due to the inclusion of revenue attributable to our acquisition of Edgewater and the continued organic growth of our installed customer base. However, we expect to continue to encounter ongoing industry pricing pressure, third-party competition and legacy network product decommissioning.\nOverall, we expect that total revenue in 2019 will increase compared with our 2018 total revenue, primarily due to the inclusion of revenue attributable to our acquisition of Edgewater.\nIn connection with the purchase price allocation to record our acquisition of GENBAND, we were required to record at fair value the assumed deferred revenue, resulting in a reduction of approximately $50 million to the assumed deferred revenue and future recognizable revenue. We recognized approximately $22 million less revenue in 2018 and expect to recognize approximately $7 million less revenue in 2019 than GENBAND would have recognized in the same period had we not acquired it. Our purchase price allocation to record our acquisition of Edgewater resulted in a reduction of approximately $4 million to the assumed deferred revenue and future recognizable revenue. We recognized approximately $2 million less revenue in the period of 2018 following the Edgewater Acquisition Date than Edgewater would have recognized in the same period had we not acquired it. We expect that these purchase accounting-related reductions to future revenue will continue through 2020, primarily related to future maintenance revenue.\nCost of Revenue/Gross Margin. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of amounts paid to third-party manufacturers for purchased materials and services, royalties and manufacturing and services personnel and related costs. Our cost of revenue and gross margins for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in millions, except percentages):\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\nfrom prior year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>142.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service\n</td> <td>127.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>118.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>269.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>128.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product\n</td> <td>49.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service\n</td> <td>57.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gross margin\n</td> <td>53.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in product gross margin in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the inclusion of GENBAND product costs for the full year in 2018 compared to the inclusion of two months of GENBAND product costs in 2017, including the amortization of intangible assets arising from the Merger, which decreased our product gross margin by approximately six percentage points, coupled with product and customer mix, which also decreased our product gross margin by approximately six percentage points.\nThe decrease in service gross margin in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the inclusion of GENBAND service costs for the full year in 2018 compared to the inclusion of two months of GENBAND service costs in 2017, coupled with higher project-related service costs, each of which decreased our service gross margin by approximately two percentage points. Although service revenue increased by approximately $150 million in 2018 compared to 2017, the increase in service costs of approximately $69 million contributed to the decline in gross margin. Our service cost of revenue is relatively fixed in advance of any particular quarter and therefore, changes in service revenue will typically have a significant impact on service gross margins.\nOur purchases of materials and components for manufacture increased in 2018 compared with 2017 due to the inclusion of GENBAND's operations since October 27, 2017 in our consolidated results. We expect our future purchases of materials and components to decrease as a result of the increase in software content of our products both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our revenue.\nWe believe that our total gross margin will increase in 2019, primarily due to the expected higher software content as a percentage of our total revenue, coupled with the impact of our restructuring and integration cost reduction initiatives.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses and prototype costs for the design, development, testing and enhancement of our products. Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in millions, except percentages):\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\nfrom prior year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$\n</td> <td>145.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in research and development expenses in 2018 compared to 2017 was attributable to approximately $18 million of higher employee-related expenses, approximately $14 million of higher product development expense (i.e., third-party development, prototype and test equipment costs) and approximately $12 million of higher infrastructure-related expense. The increase in employee-related expenses was primarily attributable to approximately $23 million of higher salary and related expenses, including our company-wide cash bonus program, partially offset by approximately $5 million of lower stock-based compensation expense. These increases were primarily attributable to the inclusion of GENBAND research and development expenses for the full year in 2018 compared to the inclusion of two months of GENBAND research and development expenses in 2017, partially offset by the cost reductions realized from our recent restructuring initiatives. Our research and development expenses in 2018 also included approximately $5 million of expense attributable to Edgewater since the Edgewater Acquisition Date, primarily for employee- and infrastructure-related expenses.\nSome aspects of our research and development efforts require significant short-term expenditures, the timing of which may cause significant variability in our expenses. We believe that rapid technological innovation is critical to our long-term success, and we are tailoring our investments to meet the requirements of our customers and market. We believe that our research and development expenses in 2019 will increase from 2018 levels due to our continued increased investment in our software solutions and the impact of Edgewater's research and development expenses for the full year 2019, partially offset by\nsavings from our ongoing restructuring and integration cost savings initiatives.\nSales and Marketing Expenses. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs, commissions, travel and entertainment expenses, promotions, customer trial and evaluations inventory and other marketing and sales support expenses. Sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in millions, except percentages):\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\nfrom prior year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$\n</td> <td>128.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in sales and marketing expenses in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to approximately $32 million of higher employee-related expenses, approximately $6 million of higher amortization of acquired intangible assets and approximately $6 million of higher infrastructure-related expenses. The increase in employee-related expenses was primarily attributable to $28 million of higher salary and commissions and related expenses, including our company-wide cash bonus program, and approximately $6 million of higher employee travel and training and related expenses, partially offset by approximately $2 million of lower stock-based compensation expense. These increases were primarily attributable to the inclusion of GENBAND sales and marketing expenses for the full year in 2018 compared to the inclusion of two months of GENBAND sales and marketing expenses in 2017, partially offset by the cost reductions realized from our recent restructuring initiatives. Our sales and marketing expenses in 2018 also included approximately $5 million of expense attributable to Edgewater for the period since the Edgewater Acquisition Date, primarily for employee- and infrastructure-related expenses.\nWe believe that our sales and marketing expenses will be essentially flat in 2019 compared with 2018, as we expect the inclusion of Edgewater's sales and marketing expenses for the full year 2019 will be offset by cost savings from our ongoing restructuring and integration cost savings initiatives.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs for executive and administrative personnel, and audit, legal and other professional fees. General and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in millions, except percentages):\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\nfrom prior year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$\n</td> <td>66.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in 2018 general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to approximately $11 million of higher professional fees (i.e., legal, audit and outside services), approximately $4 million of higher employee-related expenses, approximately $2 million of higher infrastructure-related expenses and approximately $1 million of net increases in other general and administrative expenses. The increase in our professional fees included approximately $8 million of fees related to ongoing litigation with one of our competitors and approximately $1 million of fees related to our planned convertible senior notes offering that we subsequently elected not to proceed with, as we believed that then-current market conditions were not conducive for an offering on terms that would be in the best interests of our stockholders. The increase in our employee-related expenses was primarily attributable to approximately $9 million of higher salary and related expenses, including expense in connection with our company-wide cash bonus program, partially offset by approximately $6 million of lower stock-based compensation expense. These increases were primarily attributable to the inclusion of GENBAND general and administrative expenses for the full year in 2018 compared to the inclusion of two months of GENBAND general and administrative expenses in 2017, partially offset by the cost reductions realized from our recent restructuring initiatives. Our general and administrative expenses in 2018 also included approximately $1 million of expense attributable to Edgewater, primarily for professional fees and employee- and infrastructure-related expenses.\nWe believe that our general and administrative expenses will decrease in 2019 compared with 2018, primarily due to savings from our restructuring and integration cost savings initiatives.\nAcquisition- and Integration-Related Expenses. Acquisition- and integration-related expenses include those expenses related to acquisitions that we would otherwise not have incurred. Acquisition-related expenses include professional and services fees, such as legal, audit, consulting, paying agent and other fees, and expenses related to cash payments to certain former executives of the acquired businesses in connection with their employment agreements. Integration-related expenses represent incremental costs related to combining the Company's systems and processes with those of acquired businesses,\nsuch as third-party consulting and other third-party services. We recorded approximately $17 million of acquisition- and integration-related expenses in 2018, comprised of $10 million of acquisition-related expenses and approximately $7 million of integration-related expenses. The acquisition-related expense primarily related to the Merger, with nominal amounts related to the acquisition of Edgewater and other acquisition-related activities. We recorded approximately $15 million of acquisition- and integration-related expenses in 2017, comprised of approximately $13 million of acquisition-related expense and approximately $2 million of integration-related expense. The acquisition-related expense was comprised of approximately $12 million for professional services fees and $1 million related to cash payments to certain former GENBAND executives. We estimate that we will incur additional integration-related expense in 2019 approximating $3 million.\nAcquisition- and integration-related expenses are reported separately in the consolidated statements of operations.\nRestructuring Expense. We have been committed to streamlining operations and reducing operating costs by closing and consolidating certain facilities and reducing our worldwide workforce. Please see the additional discussion of our restructuring initiatives in the \"Restructuring and Cost Reduction Initiatives\" section of the Overview of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nWe recorded restructuring expense of approximately $17 million in 2018, comprised of approximately $16 million in connection with our Merger Restructuring Initiative and approximately $1 million for changes in estimated costs in connection with our assumption of GENBAND's restructuring liability at the time of Merger.\nWe recorded net restructuring expense of approximately $9 million in 2017, comprised of approximately $9 million in connection with our Merger Restructuring Initiative, less than $1 million in connection with our Taqua Restructuring Initiative and less than $1 million in connection with our 2016 Restructuring Initiative. The net restructuring expense recorded included reversals for changes in estimated costs totaling less than $1 million in the aggregate in connection with the GENBAND Restructuring Initiative, the Taqua Restructuring Initiative and the 2016 Restructuring Initiative.\nAlthough we have eliminated positions as part of our restructuring initiatives, we continue to hire in certain areas that we believe are important to our future growth. Restructuring expense is reported separately in the consolidated statements of operations.\nInterest (Expense) Income, net. Interest expense and interest income for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in millions, except percentages):\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (decrease)\nfrom prior year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(69.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(4.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>573.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest (expense) income, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,708.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense in both 2018 and 2017 was primarily comprised of interest on the related party promissory note issued in connection with the Merger, the outstanding revolving credit facility balance, the amortization of debt issuance costs in connection with our revolving credit facilities and interest on capital lease obligations. Interest income consisted of interest earned on our cash equivalents, marketable securities and investments. The higher interest expense in 2018 compared with 2017 was primarily due to the promissory note and credit facility balances outstanding for the full year 2018, compared to approximately two months in 2017. The decrease in interest income in 2018 compared with 2017 was primarily due to the lower amounts available for investment in 2018.\nOther (Expense) Income, Net. Other expense, net, in 2018 of approximately $4 million was primarily comprised of foreign currency losses. Other income, net, in 2017 of approximately $1 million was primarily comprised of the gain on the sale of an intangible asset and foreign currency gains.\nIncome Taxes. We recorded an income tax provision of approximately $3 million in 2018 and a benefit for income taxes of approximately $18 million in 2017. The provision recorded in 2018 was primarily the result of foreign operations. The benefit recorded in 2017 was primarily the result of the release of an approximately $16 million domestic valuation allowance as a result of net deferred tax liabilities acquired as part of the GENBAND acquisition.\nDuring 2018 and 2017, we performed an analysis to determine if, based on all available evidence, we considered it more\nlikely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in a future period. As a result of our evaluations, we concluded that there was insufficient positive evidence to overcome the more objective negative evidence related to our cumulative losses and other factors. Accordingly, we maintained a valuation against our domestic deferred tax asset. A similar analysis and conclusion were made with regard to the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets of our Irish subsidiary. In analyzing the deferred tax assets related to our Canada subsidiaries, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the Canadian federal credits would not be realized in a future period.\nYears Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nRevenue.

Revenue from sales of our software with attached appliances and software licenses contributed approximately $32 million in the aggregate to the increase in product revenue in 2017, coupled with approximately $3 million of higher 2017 product revenue from sales of our software subscriptions.\nIn 2017, approximately 24% of our product revenue was from indirect sales through our channel partner program, compared to approximately 26% in 2016.\nIn 2017, approximately 20% of our product revenue was attributable to sales to enterprise customers, compared to approximately 19% in 2016. These sales were made through both our direct sales team and indirect sales channel partners.\nService revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was comprised of the following (in millions, except percentages): Table 183: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\nfrom prior year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional services\n</td> <td>34.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total service revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>148.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur maintenance revenue increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the inclusion of approximately $21 million of revenue attributable to GENBAND in 2017 for the period following the Merger Date and the inclusion of approximately $5 million of revenue attributable to Taqua.\nThe increase in our professional services revenue in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to the inclusion of approximately $10 million of revenue attributable to GENBAND in 2017 for the period following the Merger Date, coupled with an increase in the volume of network transformation solutions projects completed in 2017 compared to 2016.\nThe following customers each contributed 10% or more of our revenue in at least one of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Verizon Communications Inc.\n</td> <td>17%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AT&T Inc.\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue earned from customers domiciled outside the United States was approximately 34% of total revenue in 2017 and approximately 31% of revenue in 2016.\nOur deferred product revenue was approximately $22 million at December 31, 2017 and approximately $7 million at December 31, 2016.

These decreases were partially offset by the impact of our product and customer mix, particularly sales of certain of our security and applications products, which increased our product gross margin by approximately five percentage points in 2017.\nThe decrease in service gross margin in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to the inclusion of GENBAND expenses for the period following the Merger Date, which decreased our service gross margin by approximately four percentage points. Although service revenue increased by approximately $43 million in 2017 compared to 2016, the increase in service costs of approximately $21 million contributed to the decline in gross margin. Our service cost of revenue is relatively fixed in advance of any particular quarter and therefore, changes in service revenue will typically have a significant impact on service gross margins.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (in millions, except percentages):\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\nfrom prior year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$\n</td> <td>101.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in research and development expenses in 2017 compared to 2016 was attributable to approximately $19 million of higher employee-related expenses, approximately $7 million of higher product development expense, approximately $2 million of higher infrastructure-related expense and approximately $1 million of net increases in other research and development costs. The increase in employee-related expenses was attributable to approximately $14 million of higher salary and related expenses, approximately $2 million of higher stock-based compensation expense and approximately $3 million of higher combined expense in connection with our company-wide bonus program and employee travel, training and related expenses. Our 2017 research and development expenses included approximately $17 million of expense attributable to GENBAND, primarily comprised of approximately $9 million of employee-related expenses, approximately $5 million of product development costs, approximately $1 million of depreciation expense and approximately $1 million of infrastructure expense.\nSales and Marketing Expenses.

The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2017 compared to 2016 was attributable to approximately $10 million of higher employee-related expenses, approximately $3 million of higher professional fees and approximately $2 million of expense accrued for potential fines in connection with the then-ongoing SEC investigation. These increases were partially offset by approximately $3 million of lower infrastructure costs.\nAcquisition- and Integration-Related Expenses. We recorded approximately $15 million of acquisition- and integration-related expenses in the year ended December 31, 2017, comprised of approximately $13 million of acquisition-related expense and approximately $2 million of integration-related expense. The acquisition-related expense was comprised of approximately $12 million for professional services fees and $1 million related to cash payments to certain former GENBAND executives. We recorded approximately $1 million of acquisition-related expenses in 2016 in connection with the acquisition of Taqua.\nRestructuring Expense. We recorded net restructuring expense of approximately $9 million in 2017, comprised of approximately $9 million in connection with our Merger Restructuring Initiative, less than $1 million in connection with our Taqua Restructuring Initiative and less than $1 million in connection with our 2016 Restructuring Initiative, net of reversals for changes in estimated costs totaling less than $1 million in the aggregate in connection with the GENBAND Restructuring Initiative, the Taqua Restructuring Initiative and the 2016 Restructuring Initiative. We recorded restructuring expense aggregating approximately $3 million in 2016, primarily for severance and related costs, comprised of approximately $2 million under our 2016 Restructuring Initiative and approximately $1 million related to our Taqua Restructuring Initiative.\nInterest Income, net. Interest income and interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (in millions, except percentages):\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (decrease)\nfrom prior year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>591.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(65.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest income consisted of interest earned on our cash equivalents, marketable securities and investments. Interest expense in 2017 was primarily comprised of interest on the outstanding revolving credit facility balance assumed in connection with the acquisition of GENBAND, amortization of debt issuance costs in connection with our revolving credit facilities and interest on capital lease obligations. Interest expense in 2016 was comprised of expense related to the amortization of debt issuance costs in connection with our revolving credit facility and expense related to interest on capital lease obligations.\nOther Income, Net. Other income, net, in 2017 of approximately $1 million was primarily comprised of the gain on the sale of an intangible asset and foreign currency gains. Other income, net, in 2016 of approximately $1 million was primarily comprised of gains from the sale of intangible assets.\nIncome Taxes. We recorded a benefit for income taxes of approximately $18 million in 2017 and a provision for income taxes of approximately $3 million in 2016. The benefit recorded in 2017 was primarily the result of the release of an approximately $16 million domestic valuation allowance as a result of net deferred tax liabilities acquired as part of the GENBAND acquisition. The expense recorded in 2016 was primarily related to foreign operations. During 2017 and 2016,\nwe performed an analysis to determine if, based on all available evidence, we considered it more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in a future period. As a result of our evaluations, we concluded that there was insufficient positive evidence to overcome the more objective negative evidence related to our cumulative losses and other factors. Accordingly, we maintained a valuation against our domestic deferred tax asset. A similar analysis and conclusion were made with regard to the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets of our Irish subsidiary. In analyzing the deferred tax assets related to our Canada subsidiaries, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the Canadian federal SRED credits would not be realized in a future period.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial position, changes in financial position, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized as follows (in millions):\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to year ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(76.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(35.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(41.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments to reconcile net loss to cash flows (used in) provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>77.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in operating assets and liabilities\n</td> <td>(9.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(35.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(56.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(35.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(13.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(21.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments to reconcile net loss to cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>35.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in operating assets and liabilities\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur cash, cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments totaled approximately $51 million at December 31, 2018 and $83 million at December 31, 2017. We had cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries aggregating approximately $11 million at December 31, 2018 and $14 million at December 31, 2017. If we elect to repatriate all of the funds held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 31, 2018, we do not believe that the amounts of potential withholding taxes that would arise from the repatriation would have a material effect on our liquidity.\nOn November 13, 2018, we announced that we intended to offer, subject to market conditions and other factors, $150 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2023 in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We expected to grant the initial purchasers a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $25 million aggregate principal amount of such notes, solely to cover over-allotments, if any. On that same day, we decided not to proceed with our previously-announced offering and consequently did not sell any securities as part of such offering. We believed that then-current market conditions were not conducive for an offering on terms that would be in the best interests of our stockholders. In connection with this offering, we incurred $1 million of expense, primarily for professional fees, which is included as a component of General and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOn the Merger Date and in connection with the Merger, we assumed GENBAND's Senior Secured Credit Agreement (the \"Prior Credit Agreement\") with Silicon Valley Bank (\"SVB\"), which had outstanding borrowings and letters of credit totaling approximately $18 million and $3 million, respectively, and an average interest rate of 4.67%. GENBAND had entered into the Prior Credit Agreement with SVB effective July 1, 2016. The Prior Credit Agreement had a maturity date of July 1, 2019 and provided for revolving loans, including letters of credit and swingline loans, not to exceed $50 million in total, with potential further increases of up to $75 million available for a total revolving line of credit of up to $125 million. The Prior Credit Agreement was superseded by a Senior Secured Credit Agreement, as amended, which was entered into on December 21, 2017 and is discussed below.\nOn December 21, 2017, we entered into a Senior Secured Credit Agreement (as amended, the Credit Facility\u201d) with SVB, which refinanced the Prior Credit Agreement. The Credit Facility includes $100 million of commitments, the full amount of which is available for revolving loans, a $15 million sublimit that is available for letters of credit and a $15 million sublimit that is available for swingline loans. The Credit Facility is scheduled to mature in December 2021, subject to a springing maturity if, on or before July 14, 2020, the existing promissory note issued to certain shareholders is not converted or extended to March 2022 or later. The Credit Facility contains procedures for additional financial institutions to become lenders, or for any existing lender to increase its commitment under the facility, subject to an available increase of $50 million for all incremental commitments under the Credit Facility without amendment. On June 24, 2018, we amended the Credit Facility to, among other things, permit the Edgewater Acquisition and related transactions.\nThe indebtedness and other obligations under the Credit Facility are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by us and each of our other material U.S. domestic subsidiaries (collectively, the \"Guarantors\"). The Credit Agreement is secured by first-priority liens on substantially all of our assets.\nThe Credit Facility requires periodic interest payments on outstanding borrowings until maturity. We may prepay all revolving loans under the Credit Facility at any time without premium or penalty (other than customary LIBOR breakage costs), subject to certain notice requirements.\nRevolving loans under the Credit Facility bear interest at our option at either the Eurodollar (LIBOR) rate plus a margin ranging from 2.50% to 3.00% per year or the base rate (the highest of the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, or the prime rate announced from time to time in The Wall Street Journal) plus a margin ranging from 1.50% to 2.00% per year (such margins being referred to as the Applicable Margin\u201d). The Applicable Margin varies depending on our consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The base rate and the LIBOR rate are each subject to a zero percent floor.\nWe are charged a commitment fee ranging from 0.25% to 0.40% per year on the daily amount of the unused portions of the commitments under the Credit Facility. Additionally, with respect to all letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility, we are charged a fronting fee of 0.125% per year and an outstanding letter of credit fee equal to the Applicable Margin for base rate loans ranging from 1.50% to 2.00% times the amount of the outstanding letters of credit.\nThe Credit Facility requires compliance with certain financial covenants, including a minimum consolidated quick ratio, minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and maximum consolidated leverage ratio, all of which are defined in the Credit Agreement and tested on a quarterly basis. In addition, the Credit Facility contains various covenants that, among other restrictions, limit our and our subsidiaries' ability to enter into certain types of transactions, including, but not limited to: incurring or assuming indebtedness, making acquisitions or engaging in mergers, making investments, repurchasing equity and paying dividends, selling or otherwise transferring assets, changing the nature of our business and amending or making prepayments on certain junior debt. We were in compliance with all covenants of the Credit Facility at December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nThe Credit Facility contains events of default that are customary for a secured credit facility. If an event of default relating to bankruptcy or other insolvency events with respect to a borrower occurs, all obligations under the Credit Facility will immediately become due and payable. If any other event of default exists under the Credit Facility, the lenders may accelerate the maturity of the obligations outstanding under the Credit Facility and exercise other rights and remedies, including charging a default rate of interest equal to 2.00% per year above the rate that would otherwise be applicable. In addition, if any event of default exists under the Credit Facility, the lenders may commence foreclosure or other actions against the collateral.\nIf any default exists under the Credit Facility, or if the Borrower is unable to make any of the representations and warranties as stated in the Credit Agreement at the applicable time, the Borrower will be unable to borrow funds or have letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility, which, depending on the circumstances prevailing at that time, could have a material adverse effect on the Borrower's liquidity and working capital.\nOn December 21, 2017, concurrently with the completion of the Credit Facility, we repaid in full all outstanding amounts under the Prior Credit Agreement and terminated the agreement. We did not incur any early termination penalties in connection with the termination of the Prior Credit Agreement.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had an outstanding debt balance of $55 million at a weighted average interest rate of 5.96% and approximately $3 million of outstanding letters of credit at an interest rate of 1.75% under the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2017, we had an outstanding debt balance of $20 million at an interest rate of 4.51% and approximately $3 million of outstanding letters of credit at an interest rate of 2.00% under the Credit Facility.\nIn connection with the Merger, on October 27, 2017, we issued a promissory note for approximately $23 million to certain of GENBAND's equity holders (the \"Promissory Note\"). The Promissory Note does not amortize and the principal thereon is payable in full on the third anniversary of its execution. Interest on the promissory note is payable quarterly in arrears and accrued at a rate of 7.5% per year for the first six months after issuance, and thereafter at a rate of 10% per year. The failure to make any payment under the Promissory Note when due and, with respect to payment of any interest, the continuation of such failure for a period of thirty days thereafter, constitutes an event of default under the Promissory Note. If an event of default occurs under the Promissory Note, the payees may declare the entire balance of the Promissory Note due and payable (including principal and accrued and unpaid interest) within five business days of the payees' notification to the Company of such acceleration. Interest that is not paid on the interest payment date will increase the principal amount of the Promissory Note. At December 31, 2018, the Promissory Note balance was $24.1 million, comprised of $22.5 million of principal plus $1.6 million of interest converted to principal.\nSonus maintained a credit facility by and among Sonus, as Borrower, Bank of America, N.A. (\"Bank of America\"), as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer, and the other lenders from time to time party thereto entered into on June 27, 2014 (as amended, the \"Sonus Credit Agreement\"). The Sonus Credit Agreement expired by its terms on June 30, 2017 and was not renewed.\nOur operating activities used approximately $10 million of cash in 2018 and provided approximately $8 million of cash in 2017 and $19 million of cash in 2016.\nCash used in operating activities in 2018 was primarily the result of lower accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities and accounts payable, coupled with higher accounts receivable and other operating assets. These were partially offset by higher deferred revenue, lower inventory, and the net impact of non-cash items against our net loss. The decrease in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities is primarily related to lower accruals for taxes and professional fees. The decrease in accounts payable relates to the timing and amounts of purchases of both services and tangible goods and their related payment arrangements. The increase in accounts receivable primarily relates to the Edgewater Acquisition. Deferred revenue balances may fluctuate as a result of the timing of invoicing and revenue recognition. Our net loss, adjusted for non-cash items such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes and other non-cash items, including foreign currency exchange losses, was virtually break-even.\nCash provided by operating activities in 2017 was primarily the result of higher deferred revenue and accounts payable, coupled with decreases in inventory and other operating assets. These were partially offset by higher accounts receivable and lower accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities, plus the impact of our net loss, adjusted for non-cash items. The increase in accounts payable relates to the timing of purchases of both services and tangible goods and their related payment arrangements. The increase in accounts receivable primarily relates to higher revenue in 2017 compared to 2016, partially offset by our continued focus on our collection efforts. Our net loss, adjusted for non-cash items such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, impairment of intangible assets and deferred income taxes, was virtually break-even.\nCash provided by operating activities in 2016 was primarily the result of decreases in inventory and other operating assets and higher deferred revenue, partially offset by lower accrued expenses and accounts payable, higher accounts receivable and our net loss. The decrease in accrued expenses primarily relates to lower accruals in connection with our Company-wide cash bonus program, for which we changed the timing of bonus payments in 2016 such that a portion of the bonus was paid in August 2016 based on our results against certain internal goals for the first half of the year. Bonuses for the remainder of 2016 were paid in early 2017 based on our results for the second half of 2016. The increase in accounts receivable primarily relates to higher revenue in 2016 compared to 2015, partially offset by the results of our continued focus on our collection efforts. Our net loss, adjusted for non-cash items such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and deferred income taxes, provided approximately $21 million of cash.\nOur investing activities used approximately $35 million of cash in 2018, provided approximately $21 million of cash in 2017 and used approximately $27 million of cash in 2016. In 2018, we used approximately $46 million to pay the cash consideration for the Edgewater Acquisition and approximately $8 million to purchase property and equipment, partially offset by approximately $19 million of sales and maturities of our investments in marketable securities. In 2017, net sales of our investments in marketable securities provided approximately $67 million of cash, of which we used approximately $43 million to pay the cash consideration for GENBAND. We used approximately $4 million to purchase property and equipment. In 2016, we used approximately $21 million of cash, net of cash acquired, for business acquisitions, approximately $5 million of cash for the purchase of property and equipment, and approximately $3 million for net investments in marketable securities. The amount used for business acquisitions was comprised of $20 million, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition of Taqua, and slightly under $1 million paid as the final consideration installment for a previous acquisition.\nOur financing activities provided approximately $32 million of cash in 2018 and used approximately $4 million of cash in 2017 and $10 million in 2016. The 2018 amount was primarily comprised of approximately $35 million of net borrowings against our Credit Facility, partially offset by approximately $2 million used to pay withholding obligations related to the net share settlement of restricted and performance-based stock grants upon vesting and approximately $1 million in the aggregate used to make principal payments on our capital lease obligations and debt issuance costs related to our Credit Facility. The 2017 amount was primarily comprised of approximately $8 million used to pay withholding obligations related to the net share settlement of restricted and performance-based stock grants upon vesting and $1 million to pay debt issuance costs related to our Credit Facility, partially offset by approximately $2 million of net borrowings against our Credit Facility, $1 million of proceeds from the sale of our common stock in connection with our Amended and Restated 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended, and approximately $1 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options. The 2016 amount was primarily comprised of approximately $10 million used for the repurchase of common stock under our stock buyback program.\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations at December 31, 2018 consisted of the following (in millions):\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations *\n</td> <td>57.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>40.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring severance obligations\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt obligations - principal **\n</td> <td>79.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee postretirement defined benefit plans\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Uncertain tax positions ***\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>192.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________________________\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>*\n</td> <td>Includes restructuring payments aggregating approximately $1 million, approximately 50% of which is due in less than one year and the remainder is due in one to three years.

However, we cannot be sure that our current cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and available borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our future needs. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows in the future, and if availability under our credit facility is not sufficient to support our\noperations, we may need to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing. We may not be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all.\nThe rate at which we will consume cash will be dependent on the cash needs of future operations, including changes in working capital, which will, in turn, be directly affected by the levels of demand for our products, the timing and rate of expansion of our business, the resources we devote to developing our products and any litigation settlements. We anticipate devoting substantial capital resources to continue our research and development efforts, to maintain our sales, support and marketing, to complete merger-related integration activities and for other general corporate activities. However, it is difficult to predict future liquidity requirements with certainty. See Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our other contingencies.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2014-09, its new standard on revenue from contracts with customers, along with additional ASUs which, among other things, clarified the implementation of the new revenue guidance and delayed the adoption by one year, to January 1, 2018 (the \"New Revenue Standard\"). The New Revenue Standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The core principle of the revenue model is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In applying the revenue model to contracts within its scope, an entity identifies the contract(s) with a customer, identifies the performance obligations in the contract, determines the transaction price, allocates the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and recognizes revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the New Revenue Standard using the modified retrospective option and have identified the necessary changes to our policies, processes, systems and controls. Under the modified retrospective method, we are applying the New Revenue Standard to all contracts not yet completed as of January 1, 2018, recognizing in beginning Accumulated deficit an adjustment for the cumulative effect of the change and providing additional disclosures comparing results to those as if we were still following the previous accounting standards. Under ASC 605, we concluded we did not have VSOE for certain elements in software bundled arrangements, which resulted in revenue being recognized ratably over the longest performance period. The majority of the transition adjustments related to these arrangements. In connection with the adoption of ASC 606, as of January 1, 2018, the Company recorded an adjustment to decrease Accumulated deficit by approximately $12 million and capitalized certain commission costs resulting directly from securing contracts which were previously expensed.\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting (\"ASU 2017-09\"), which amends the scope of modification accounting for share-based payment arrangements such that an entity would not apply modification accounting if the fair value, vesting conditions and classification of the awards are the same immediately before and after the modification. ASU 2017-09 became effective for us beginning January 1, 2018 for both interim and annual reporting periods. The adoption of ASU 2017-09 did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Post Retirement Benefit Cost (\"ASU 2017-07\"). ASU 2017-07 amends the requirements in ASC 715, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (\"ASC 715\") to require entities to disaggregate the current-service-cost component from the other components of net benefit cost (the \"other components\") and include it with other current compensation costs for related employees, present the other components elsewhere in the income statement and outside of income from operations if such a subtotal is presented and disclose the income statement lines that contain the other components if they are not presented on appropriately described separate lines. ASU 2017-07 became effective for us beginning January 1, 2018 for both interim and annual reporting periods. The adoption of ASU 2017-07 did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (\"ASU 2016-15\"), which adds or clarifies guidance on eight cash flow issues, including debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or certain other debt instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, distributions received from equity method investees, beneficial interests in securitization transactions and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. ASU 2016-15 became effective for us beginning January 1, 2018 for both interim and annual reporting periods.\nEntities must apply the guidance retrospectively to all periods presented but may apply it prospectively from the earliest date practicable if retrospective application would be impracticable. The adoption of ASU 2016-15 did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract ( ASU 2018-15\u201d), which provides guidance on implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement ( CCA\u201d) that is a service contract. ASU 2018-15 amends ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other ( ASC 350\u201d) to include in its scope implementation costs of a CCA that is a service contract and clarifies that a customer should apply the guidance in ASC 350-40 to determine which implementation costs should be capitalized in such a CCA. ASU 2018-15 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2020. We are currently assessing the potential impact of the adoption of ASU 2018-15 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) Section A - Leases: Amendments to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASU 2016-02\"), its new standard on accounting for leases. ASU 2016-02 introduces a lessee model that brings most leases onto the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 eliminates the current GAAP requirement for an entity to use bright-line tests in determining lease classification. ASU 2016-02 became effective for us for both interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2019. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, we will recognize lease obligations for the right to use these assets in connection with our existing lease agreements. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements (\"ASU 2018-11\") and ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases, both of which provided improvements to certain aspects of the guidance in ASC 842, Leases. In January 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-01, Leases (Topic 842): Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842, which provided additional clarification and implementation guidance. We have elected to use the alternative transition method as described in ASU 2018-11, which allows entities to initially apply ASU 2016-02 at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings, with no subsequent adjustments to prior period lease costs for comparability. To illustrate the magnitude of this change, the amount of our off-balance sheet operating leases at December 31, 2018 is disclosed in Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements. Beginning on January 1, 2019, our operating leases, excluding those with terms less than 12 months, were discounted and recorded as assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.\nIn addition, the FASB has issued the following accounting pronouncements, none of which we believe will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements:\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General (Subtopic 715-20): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans ( ASU 2018-14\u201d), which amends ASC 715 to add, remove and clarify disclosure requirements related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. ASU 2018-14 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2020.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement ( ASU 2018-13\u201d), which changes the fair value measurement requirements of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement ( ASC 820\u201d). ASU 2018-13 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2020 for both interim and annual reporting.\nIn July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-09, Codification Improvements ( ASU 2018-09\u201d), which contains amendments to clarify, correct errors in or make minor improvements to the Codification. ASU 2018-09 makes improvements to multiple topics, including but not limited to comprehensive income, debt, income taxes related to both stock-based compensation and business combinations, fair value measurement and defined contribution benefit plans. ASU 2018-09 became effective for us beginning January 1, 2019.\nIn June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting (\"ASU 2018-07\"), which expands the scope of ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation (\"ASC 718\"), to include all share-based payment arrangements related to the acquisition of goods and services from both nonemployees and employees. As a result, most of the guidance in ASC 718 associated with employee share-based payments, including most of its requirements related to classification and measurement, applies to nonemployee share-based payment arrangements. ASU 2018-07 became effective for us beginning January 1, 2019.\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (\"ASU 2018-02\"), which amends ASC 220, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income, to allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive\nincome to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Act and requires entities to provide certain disclosures regarding stranded tax effects. ASU 2018-02 became effective for us beginning January 1, 2019.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory (\"ASU 2016-16\"), which removes the prohibition in ASC 740, Income Taxes, against the immediate recognition of the current and deferred income tax effects of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. ASU 2016-16 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2019 for both interim and annual reporting periods.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (\"ASU 2016-13\"), which adds an impairment model that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under ASU 2016-13, an entity recognizes as an allowance its estimate of expected credit losses, which the FASB believes will result in more timely recognition of such losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2020 for both interim and annual reporting periods, with early adoption permitted.", "item_7_truncated": "\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\nfrom prior year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$\n</td> <td>101.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and Development Expenses.

In determining future taxable income, we are responsible for assumptions utilized, including the amount of state, federal and international pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage our underlying businesses.

Because control transfers over time, revenue is recognized based on progress toward completion of the performance obligation. The method to measure progress toward completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. We generally use the input method to measure progress for our contracts because we believe it best depicts the transfer of assets to the customer which occurs as we incur costs for the contracts. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the progress toward completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. When the measure of progress is based upon expended labor, progress toward completion is measured as the ratio of labor time expended to date versus the total estimated labor time required to complete the performance obligation. Revenue is recorded proportionally as costs are incurred or as labor is expended. Costs to fulfill these obligations include internal labor as well as subcontractor costs.\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\nfrom prior year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$\n</td> <td>145.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur operating activities used approximately $10 million of cash in 2018 and provided approximately $8 million of cash in 2017 and $19 million of cash in 2016.\nCash used in operating activities in 2018 was primarily the result of lower accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities and accounts payable, coupled with higher accounts receivable and other operating assets. These were partially offset by higher deferred revenue, lower inventory, and the net impact of non-cash items against our net loss. The decrease in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities is primarily related to lower accruals for taxes and professional fees. The decrease in accounts payable relates to the timing and amounts of purchases of both services and tangible goods and their related payment arrangements. The increase in accounts receivable primarily relates to the Edgewater Acquisition. Deferred revenue balances may fluctuate as a result of the timing of invoicing and revenue recognition. Our net loss, adjusted for non-cash items such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes and other non-cash items, including foreign currency exchange losses, was virtually break-even.\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\nfrom prior year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$\n</td> <td>47.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn October 27, 2017 (the \"Merger Date\"), Sonus Networks, Inc.

Cost of revenue and gross margins for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (in millions, except percentages):\nAccounting for Income Taxes. Our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion. The current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for 2018. We provide for deferred income taxes resulting from temporary differences between financial and taxable income. Such differences arise primarily from tax net operating loss (\"NOL\") and credit carryforwards, depreciation, deferred revenue, stock-based compensation expense, accruals and reserves.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory (\"ASU 2016-16\"), which removes the prohibition in ASC 740, Income Taxes, against the immediate recognition of the current and deferred income tax effects of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. ASU 2016-16 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2019 for both interim and annual reporting periods.\nOn November 13, 2018, we announced that we intended to offer, subject to market conditions and other factors, $150 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2023 in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We expected to grant the initial purchasers a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $25 million aggregate principal amount of such notes, solely to cover over-allotments, if any. On that same day, we decided not to proceed with our previously-announced offering and consequently did not sell any securities as part of such offering. We believed that then-current market conditions were not conducive for an offering on terms that would be in the best interests of our stockholders. In connection with this offering, we incurred $1 million of expense, primarily for professional fees, which is included as a component of General and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\nRevolving loans under the Credit Facility bear interest at our option at either the Eurodollar (LIBOR) rate plus a margin ranging from 2.50% to 3.00% per year or the base rate (the highest of the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, or the prime rate announced from time to time in The Wall Street Journal) plus a margin ranging from 1.50% to 2.00% per year (such margins being referred to as the Applicable Margin\u201d). The Applicable Margin varies depending on our consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The base rate and the LIBOR rate are each subject to a zero percent floor.\nSonus maintained a credit facility by and among Sonus, as Borrower, Bank of America, N.A. (\"Bank of America\"), as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer, and the other lenders from time to time party thereto entered into on June 27, 2014 (as amended, the \"Sonus Credit Agreement\"). The Sonus Credit Agreement expired by its terms on June 30, 2017 and was not renewed.\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, the Company may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nYears Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nThe increase in sales and marketing expenses in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to the inclusion of GENBAND's expenses, aggregating approximately $14 million, for the 2017 period following the Merger Date, primarily comprised of approximately $10 million of employee-related expenses, $3 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets and $2 million of infrastructure-related expense.\nWe believe that our sales and marketing expenses will be essentially flat in 2019 compared with 2018, as we expect the inclusion of Edgewater's sales and marketing expenses for the full year 2019 will be offset by cost savings from our ongoing restructuring and integration cost savings initiatives.\n\nOur contractual obligations at December 31, 2018 consisted of the following (in millions):\n\nThe decrease in service gross margin in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to the inclusion of GENBAND expenses for the period following the Merger Date, which decreased our service gross margin by approximately four percentage points. Although service revenue increased by approximately $43 million in 2017 compared to 2016, the increase in service costs of approximately $21 million contributed to the decline in gross margin. Our service cost of revenue is relatively fixed in advance of any particular quarter and therefore, changes in service revenue will typically have a significant impact on service gross margins.\nRestructuring Expense. We have been committed to streamlining operations and reducing operating costs by closing and consolidating certain facilities and reducing our worldwide workforce. Please see the additional discussion of our restructuring initiatives in the \"Restructuring and Cost Reduction Initiatives\" section of the Overview of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe increase in product revenue in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily the result of the inclusion of GENBAND's product revenue for the period following the Merger Date. Revenue from sales of our software with attached appliances and software licenses contributed approximately $32 million in the aggregate to the increase in product revenue in 2017, coupled with approximately $3 million of higher 2017 product revenue from sales of our software subscriptions.\nService revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was comprised of the following (in millions, except\nWe are a leading provider of next generation (\"NextGen\") software solutions to telecommunications, wireless and cable service providers and enterprises across industry verticals.

We sell our software solutions through both direct sales and indirect channels globally, leveraging the assistance of resellers, and we provide ongoing support to our customers through a global services team with experience in design, deployment and maintenance of some of the world's largest software IP networks.\nOur deferred product revenue was approximately $14 million at December 31, 2018 and approximately $22 million at December 31, 2017. Our deferred service revenue was approximately $108 million at December 31, 2018 and approximately $93 million at December 31, 2017. Our deferred revenue balance may fluctuate as a result of the timing of revenue recognition, customer payments, maintenance contract renewals, contractual billing rights and maintenance revenue deferrals included in multiple element arrangements.\nStock-Based Compensation. Our stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period.\nThe increase in research and development expenses in 2018 compared to 2017 was attributable to approximately $18 million of higher employee-related expenses, approximately $14 million of higher product development expense (i.e., third-party development, prototype and test equipment costs) and approximately $12 million of higher infrastructure-related expense. The increase in employee-related expenses was primarily attributable to approximately $23 million of higher salary and related expenses, including our company-wide cash bonus program, partially offset by approximately $5 million of lower stock-based compensation expense. These increases were primarily attributable to the inclusion of GENBAND research and development expenses for the full year in 2018 compared to the inclusion of two months of GENBAND research and development expenses in 2017, partially offset by the cost reductions realized from our recent restructuring initiatives. Our research and development expenses in 2018 also included approximately $5 million of expense attributable to Edgewater since the Edgewater Acquisition Date, primarily for employee- and infrastructure-related expenses.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General (Subtopic 715-20): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans ( ASU 2018-14\u201d), which amends ASC 715 to add, remove and clarify disclosure requirements related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. ASU 2018-14 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2020.\n *** This liability is not subject to fixed payment terms and the amount and timing of payments, if any, that we will make related to this liability are not known. See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. \nRevenue. Revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was as follows (in millions, except percentages):\nIn July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-09, Codification Improvements ( ASU 2018-09\u201d), which contains amendments to clarify, correct errors in or make minor improvements to the Codification. ASU 2018-09 makes improvements to multiple topics, including but not limited to comprehensive income, debt, income taxes related to both stock-based compensation and business combinations, fair value measurement and defined contribution benefit plans. ASU 2018-09 became effective for us beginning January 1, 2019.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to: reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%; requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries; generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; requiring a current inclusion in U.S. federal taxable income of certain earnings (Global Intangible Low-taxed Income) (\"GILTI\") of controlled foreign corporations; eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (\"AMT\") and changing how existing AMT credits can be realized; creating the base erosion anti-abuse tax; creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense; changing rules related to uses and limitations of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017; providing a tax deduction for foreign-derived intangible income; and changing rules related to deductibility of compensation for certain officers.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs for executive and administrative personnel, and audit, legal and other professional fees. General and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in millions, except percentages):\nCustomer support includes software updates on a when-and-if-available basis, telephone support, integrated web-based support and bug fixes or patches. We sell our customer support contracts at a percentage of list or net product price related to the support. Customer support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the customer support agreement, which is typically one year.\nOur 2017 general and administrative expenses included approximately $5 million of expense attributable to GENBAND for the period following the Merger Date. The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2017 compared to 2016 was attributable to approximately $10 million of higher employee-related expenses, approximately $3 million of higher professional fees and approximately $2 million of expense accrued for potential fines in connection with the then-ongoing SEC investigation. These increases were partially offset by approximately $3 million of lower infrastructure costs.\nIn 2018, approximately 21% of our product revenue was attributable to sales to enterprise customers, compared to approximately 20% in 2017. These sales were made through both our direct sales team and indirect sales channel partners.\nWe recorded stock-based compensation expense of approximately $11 million in 2018, $26 million in 2017 and $20 million in 2016. The expense recorded in 2017 includes approximately $9 million of incremental expense related to the acceleration of stock options and certain full value stock awards in connection with the Merger.\nDuring 2018 and 2017, we performed an analysis to determine if, based on all available evidence, we considered it more\nprojections, additional inventory write-downs could be required and would be reflected in the cost of revenue in the period the revision is made. To date, we have not been required to revise any of our assumptions or estimates used in determining our inventory valuations.\nIn connection with the acquisition of Taqua, we implemented a restructuring plan in the third quarter of 2016 to eliminate certain redundant positions within the combined companies. On October 24, 2016, the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors (the \"Audit Committee\") approved a broader Taqua restructuring plan related to headcount and redundant facilities (collectively, the \"Taqua Restructuring Initiative\"). In connection with this initiative, we have recorded approximately $2 million of restructuring expense for severance and related costs and estimated costs related to the elimination of redundant facilities, including adjustments recorded for changes in cost estimates for the planned restructuring activities. The actions under the Taqua Restructuring Initiative have been implemented and accordingly, we do not expect to record additional expense in connection with this initiative. The amounts accrued for severance and related costs were fully paid by the end of the third quarter of 2017. We expect that the amounts accrued for facilities costs will be paid in 2019.\nIncome Taxes. We recorded an income tax provision of approximately $3 million in 2018 and a benefit for income taxes of approximately $18 million in 2017. The provision recorded in 2018 was primarily the result of foreign operations. The benefit recorded in 2017 was primarily the result of the release of an approximately $16 million domestic valuation allowance as a result of net deferred tax liabilities acquired as part of the GENBAND acquisition.\nThe Edgewater Acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination and the financial results of Edgewater have been included in our consolidated financial statements for the period subsequent to the Edgewater Acquisition Date.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) Section A - Leases: Amendments to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASU 2016-02\"), its new standard on accounting for leases. ASU 2016-02 introduces a lessee model that brings most leases onto the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 eliminates the current GAAP requirement for an entity to use bright-line tests in determining lease classification. ASU 2016-02 became effective for us for both interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2019. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, we will recognize lease obligations for the right to use these assets in connection with our existing lease agreements. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements (\"ASU 2018-11\") and ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases, both of which provided improvements to certain aspects of the guidance in ASC 842, Leases. In January 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-01, Leases (Topic 842): Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842, which provided additional clarification and implementation guidance. We have elected to use the alternative transition method as described in ASU 2018-11, which allows entities to initially apply ASU 2016-02 at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings, with no subsequent adjustments to prior period lease costs for comparability. To illustrate the magnitude of this change, the amount of our off-balance sheet operating leases at December 31, 2018 is disclosed in Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements. Beginning on January 1, 2019, our operating leases, excluding those with terms less than 12 months, were discounted and recorded as assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.\nWe believe that our total gross margin will increase in 2019, primarily due to the expected higher software content as a percentage of our total revenue, coupled with the impact of our restructuring and integration cost reduction initiatives.\nWe write down our evaluation equipment at the time of shipment to our customers, as it is not probable that the inventory value will be realizable.\nGENBAND\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (\"ASU 2016-13\"), which adds an impairment model that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under ASU 2016-13, an entity recognizes as an allowance its estimate of expected credit losses, which the FASB believes will result in more timely recognition of such losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2020 for both interim and annual reporting periods, with early adoption permitted.\nThe increase in 2018 general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to approximately $11 million of higher professional fees (i.e., legal, audit and outside services), approximately $4 million of higher employee-related expenses, approximately $2 million of higher infrastructure-related expenses and approximately $1 million of net increases in other general and administrative expenses. The increase in our professional fees included approximately $8 million of fees related to ongoing litigation with one of our competitors and approximately $1 million of fees related to our planned convertible senior notes offering that we subsequently elected not to proceed with, as we believed that then-current market conditions were not conducive for an offering on terms that would be in the best interests of our stockholders. The increase in our employee-related expenses was primarily attributable to approximately $9 million of higher salary and related expenses, including expense in connection with our company-wide cash bonus program, partially offset by approximately $6 million of lower stock-based compensation expense. These increases were primarily attributable to the inclusion of GENBAND general and administrative expenses for the full year in 2018 compared to the inclusion of two months of GENBAND general and administrative expenses in 2017, partially offset by the cost reductions realized from our recent restructuring initiatives. Our general and administrative expenses in 2018 also included approximately $1 million of expense attributable to Edgewater, primarily for professional fees and employee- and infrastructure-related expenses.\nTaqua, LLC\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (\"ASU 2016-15\"), which adds or clarifies guidance on eight cash flow issues, including debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or certain other debt instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, distributions received from equity method investees, beneficial interests in securitization transactions and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. ASU 2016-15 became effective for us beginning January 1, 2018 for both interim and annual reporting periods.\nSee \"Results of Operations\" in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") for additional discussion of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nOverall, we expect that total revenue in 2019 will increase compared with our 2018 total revenue, primarily due to the inclusion of revenue attributable to our acquisition of Edgewater.\nWe grant performance-based stock units, some of which include a market condition, to certain of our executives. We use a Monte Carlo simulation approach to model future stock price movements based upon the risk-free rate of return, the volatility of each entity, and the pair-wise covariance between each entity. These results are then used to calculate the grant date fair values of the performance-based stock units.\n\nOur investing activities used approximately $35 million of cash in 2018, provided approximately $21 million of cash in 2017 and used approximately $27 million of cash in 2016. In 2018, we used approximately $46 million to pay the cash consideration for the Edgewater Acquisition and approximately $8 million to purchase property and equipment, partially offset by approximately $19 million of sales and maturities of our investments in marketable securities. In 2017, net sales of our investments in marketable securities provided approximately $67 million of cash, of which we used approximately $43 million to pay the cash consideration for GENBAND. We used approximately $4 million to purchase property and equipment. In 2016, we used approximately $21 million of cash, net of cash acquired, for business acquisitions, approximately $5 million of cash for the purchase of property and equipment, and approximately $3 million for net investments in marketable securities. The amount used for business acquisitions was comprised of $20 million, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition of Taqua, and slightly under $1 million paid as the final consideration installment for a previous acquisition.\nIn connection with the Merger, we implemented a restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of 2017 to eliminate certain redundant positions and facilities within the combined companies (the \"Merger Restructuring Initiative\"). We recorded approximately $16 million of restructuring expense related to the Merger Restructuring Initiative in 2018, comprised of approximately $15 million for severance and related expenses and approximately $1 million in connection with redundant facilities located in the Czech Republic, Canada and the U.S. We recorded approximately $9 million of restructuring expense for severance and related expenses in 2017 related to the Merger Restructuring Initiative. We anticipate that we will record additional future expense in connection with this initiative for headcount and redundant facilities aggregating approximately $5 million. We believe that the severance payments currently accrued will be completed in 2019 and that the payments related to redundant facilities will be completed in 2029, when the last of the leases for these restructured facilities expires. We are actively seeking to sublease each of these facilities.\n \ntypical contract includes both product and services. Generally, contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. SSPs are typically estimated based on observable transactions when these services are sold on a standalone basis.\nManagement's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from management's estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. The significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical include revenue recognition, the valuation of inventory, loss contingencies and reserves, stock-based compensation, business combinations, goodwill and intangible assets, and accounting for income taxes.\nIn 2017, approximately 24% of our product revenue was from indirect sales through our channel partner program, compared to approximately 26% in 2016.\n\nCash provided by operating activities in 2017 was primarily the result of higher deferred revenue and accounts payable, coupled with decreases in inventory and other operating assets. These were partially offset by higher accounts receivable and lower accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities, plus the impact of our net loss, adjusted for non-cash items. The increase in accounts payable relates to the timing of purchases of both services and tangible goods and their related payment arrangements. The increase in accounts receivable primarily relates to higher revenue in 2017 compared to 2016, partially offset by our continued focus on our collection efforts. Our net loss, adjusted for non-cash items such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, impairment of intangible assets and deferred income taxes, was virtually break-even.\nWe provide for income taxes during interim periods based on the estimated effective tax rate for the full year. We record a cumulative adjustment to the tax provision in an interim period in which a change in the estimated annual effective tax rate is determined.\nOur maintenance revenue increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the inclusion of approximately $21 million of revenue attributable to GENBAND in 2017 for the period following the Merger Date and the inclusion of approximately $5 million of revenue attributable to Taqua.\nOverview\nWe expect that our product revenue in 2019 will increase compared with 2018 levels, primarily due to the inclusion of revenue attributable to our acquisition of Edgewater.\n\nOur maintenance revenue increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the inclusion of GENBAND maintenance revenue for the full year in 2018 compared to the inclusion of two months of GENBAND maintenance revenue in 2017.\n\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2014-09, its new standard on revenue from contracts with customers, along with additional ASUs which, among other things, clarified the implementation of the new revenue guidance and delayed the adoption by one year, to January 1, 2018 (the \"New Revenue Standard\"). The New Revenue Standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The core principle of the revenue model is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In applying the revenue model to contracts within its scope, an entity identifies the contract(s) with a customer, identifies the performance obligations in the contract, determines the transaction price, allocates the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and recognizes revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the New Revenue Standard using the modified retrospective option and have identified the necessary changes to our policies, processes, systems and controls. Under the modified retrospective method, we are applying the New Revenue Standard to all contracts not yet completed as of January 1, 2018, recognizing in beginning Accumulated deficit an adjustment for the cumulative effect of the change and providing additional disclosures comparing results to those as if we were still following the previous accounting standards. Under ASC 605, we concluded we did not have VSOE for certain elements in software bundled arrangements, which resulted in revenue being recognized ratably over the longest performance period. The majority of the transition adjustments related to these arrangements. In connection with the adoption of ASC 606, as of January 1, 2018, the Company recorded an adjustment to decrease Accumulated deficit by approximately $12 million and capitalized certain commission costs resulting directly from securing contracts which were previously expensed.\nRevenue earned from customers domiciled outside the United States was approximately 34% of total revenue in 2017 and approximately 31% of revenue in 2016.\nAnova Data, Inc.\nAs consideration for the Edgewater Acquisition, we paid, in the aggregate, approximately $46 million of cash, net of cash acquired, and issued 4.2 million shares of Ribbon common stock to Edgewater's selling shareholders and holders of vested in-the-money options and warrants to acquire common stock of Edgewater (the \"Edgewater Selling Stakeholders\") on the Edgewater Acquisition Date. The cash payment was funded through our existing credit facility. We had previously agreed to pay the Edgewater Selling Stakeholders an additional $30 million of cash, $15 million of which was to be paid six months from the Edgewater Acquisition Date and the other $15 million of which was to be paid as early as nine months from the Edgewater Acquisition Date and no later than 18 months from the Edgewater Acquisition Date (the exact timing of which would depend on the amount of revenue generated from the sales of Edgewater products in 2018) (the \"Edgewater Deferred Consideration\"). On February 15, 2019, we and the Edgewater Selling Stakeholders agreed to reduce the amount of Edgewater Deferred Consideration from $30 million to $21.9 million and agreed that all such deferred consideration will be payable on March 8, 2019.\nInterest Income, net. Interest income and interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (in millions, except percentages):\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, NewCo issued 50.9 million shares to the GENBAND equity holders, with the number of shares issued in the aggregate to the GENBAND equity holders equal to the number of shares of Sonus common stock\n\nThe increase in our professional services revenue in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the inclusion of GENBAND professional services revenue for the full year in 2018 compared to the inclusion of two months of GENBAND professional services revenue in 2017.\nWe assess all material positions taken in any income tax return, including all significant uncertain positions, in all tax years that are still subject to assessment or challenge by relevant taxing authorities. Assessing an uncertain tax position begins with the initial determination of the position's sustainability and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. As of each balance sheet date, unresolved uncertain tax positions must be reassessed, and we will determine whether (i) the factors underlying the sustainability assertion have changed and (ii) the amount of recognized tax benefit is still appropriate. The recognition and measurement of tax benefits require significant judgment. Judgments concerning the recognition and measurement of a tax benefit might change as new information becomes available.\nRestructuring Expense. We recorded net restructuring expense of approximately $9 million in 2017, comprised of approximately $9 million in connection with our Merger Restructuring Initiative, less than $1 million in connection with our Taqua Restructuring Initiative and less than $1 million in connection with our 2016 Restructuring Initiative, net of reversals for changes in estimated costs totaling less than $1 million in the aggregate in connection with the GENBAND Restructuring Initiative, the Taqua Restructuring Initiative and the 2016 Restructuring Initiative. We recorded restructuring expense aggregating approximately $3 million in 2016, primarily for severance and related costs, comprised of approximately $2 million under our 2016 Restructuring Initiative and approximately $1 million related to our Taqua Restructuring Initiative.\nsavings from our ongoing restructuring and integration cost savings initiatives.\nIn June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting (\"ASU 2018-07\"), which expands the scope of ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation (\"ASC 718\"), to include all share-based payment arrangements related to the acquisition of goods and services from both nonemployees and employees. As a result, most of the guidance in ASC 718 associated with employee share-based payments, including most of its requirements related to classification and measurement, applies to nonemployee share-based payment arrangements. ASU 2018-07 became effective for us beginning January 1, 2019.\nCash provided by operating activities in 2016 was primarily the result of decreases in inventory and other operating assets and higher deferred revenue, partially offset by lower accrued expenses and accounts payable, higher accounts receivable and our net loss. The decrease in accrued expenses primarily relates to lower accruals in connection with our Company-wide cash bonus program, for which we changed the timing of bonus payments in 2016 such that a portion of the bonus was paid in August 2016 based on our results against certain internal goals for the first half of the year. Bonuses for the remainder of 2016 were paid in early 2017 based on our results for the second half of 2016. The increase in accounts receivable primarily relates to higher revenue in 2016 compared to 2015, partially offset by the results of our continued focus on our collection efforts. Our net loss, adjusted for non-cash items such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and deferred income taxes, provided approximately $21 million of cash.\nWe use the Black-Scholes valuation model for estimating the fair value on the date of grant of employee stock options. Determining the fair value of stock option awards at the grant date requires judgment regarding certain valuation assumptions, including the volatility of our stock price, expected term of the option, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. Changes in such assumptions and estimates could result in different fair values and could therefore impact our earnings. Such changes, however, would not impact our cash flows. The fair value of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance-based awards is based upon our stock price on the grant date.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe decrease in service gross margin in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the inclusion of GENBAND service costs for the full year in 2018 compared to the inclusion of two months of GENBAND service costs in 2017, coupled with higher project-related service costs, each of which decreased our service gross margin by approximately two percentage points. Although service revenue increased by approximately $150 million in 2018 compared to 2017, the increase in service costs of approximately $69 million contributed to the decline in gross margin. Our service cost of revenue is relatively fixed in advance of any particular quarter and therefore, changes in service revenue will typically have a significant impact on service gross margins.\nThe increase in sales and marketing expenses in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to approximately $32 million of higher employee-related expenses, approximately $6 million of higher amortization of acquired intangible assets and approximately $6 million of higher infrastructure-related expenses. The increase in employee-related expenses was primarily attributable to $28 million of higher salary and commissions and related expenses, including our company-wide cash bonus program, and approximately $6 million of higher employee travel and training and related expenses, partially offset by approximately $2 million of lower stock-based compensation expense. These increases were primarily attributable to the inclusion of GENBAND sales and marketing expenses for the full year in 2018 compared to the inclusion of two months of GENBAND sales and marketing expenses in 2017, partially offset by the cost reductions realized from our recent restructuring initiatives. Our sales and marketing expenses in 2018 also included approximately $5 million of expense attributable to Edgewater for the period since the Edgewater Acquisition Date, primarily for employee- and infrastructure-related expenses.\nOn the Merger Date and in connection with the Merger, we assumed GENBAND's Senior Secured Credit Agreement (the \"Prior Credit Agreement\") with Silicon Valley Bank (\"SVB\"), which had outstanding borrowings and letters of credit totaling approximately $18 million and $3 million, respectively, and an average interest rate of 4.67%. GENBAND had entered into the Prior Credit Agreement with SVB effective July 1, 2016. The Prior Credit Agreement had a maturity date of July 1, 2019 and provided for revolving loans, including letters of credit and swingline loans, not to exceed $50 million in total, with potential further increases of up to $75 million available for a total revolving line of credit of up to $125 million. The Prior Credit Agreement was superseded by a Senior Secured Credit Agreement, as amended, which was entered into on December 21, 2017 and is discussed below.\nValuation of Inventory. We review inventory for both potential obsolescence and potential loss of value periodically. In this review, we make assumptions about the future demand for and market value of the inventory and, based on these assumptions, estimate the amount of any excess, obsolete or slow-moving inventory.\noperations, we may need to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing. We may not be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all.\nIf any default exists under the Credit Facility, or if the Borrower is unable to make any of the representations and warranties as stated in the Credit Agreement at the applicable time, the Borrower will be unable to borrow funds or have letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility, which, depending on the circumstances prevailing at that time, could have a material adverse effect on the Borrower's liquidity and working capital.\nWe assumed GENBAND's restructuring liability aggregating approximately $4 million at the Merger Date (the \"GENBAND Restructuring Initiative\"), primarily related to headcount reductions. In 2018, we recorded approximately $1 million of restructuring expense for changes in estimated costs for previously recorded initiatives, primarily changes in negotiated severance to employees in certain international locations and changes in estimated sublease income for restructured facilities. We do not expect to record additional expense in connection with this initiative except for adjustments for changes in estimated costs. We believe that the payments will be completed in 2020, when the lease for this restructured facility expires.\nIn 2017, approximately 20% of our product revenue was attributable to sales to enterprise customers, compared to approximately 19% in 2016. These sales were made through both our direct sales team and indirect sales channel partners.\nIn connection with the purchase price allocation to record our acquisition of GENBAND, we were required to record at fair value the assumed deferred revenue, resulting in a reduction of approximately $50 million to the assumed deferred revenue and future recognizable revenue. We recognized approximately $22 million less revenue in 2018 and expect to recognize approximately $7 million less revenue in 2019 than GENBAND would have recognized in the same period had we not acquired it. Our purchase price allocation to record our acquisition of Edgewater resulted in a reduction of approximately $4 million to the assumed deferred revenue and future recognizable revenue. We recognized approximately $2 million less revenue in the period of 2018 following the Edgewater Acquisition Date than Edgewater would have recognized in the same period had we not acquired it. We expect that these purchase accounting-related reductions to future revenue will continue through 2020, primarily related to future maintenance revenue.\nOur annual testing for impairment of goodwill is completed as of November 30. We operate as a single operating segment with one reporting unit and consequently we evaluate goodwill for impairment based on an evaluation of the fair value of the Company as a whole. We performed our step one assessments for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 and determined each year that our fair value was in excess of our carrying value and accordingly, there was no impairment of goodwill. At certain times during 2018, including at our annual testing date of November 30, 2018, our market capitalization was below our book value. While we have concluded that the fair value exceeds carrying value at that date, we regularly monitor for changes in circumstances, including changes to our projections regarding performance of the business, that could result in impairment of goodwill.\nThe increase in research and development expenses in 2017 compared to 2016 was attributable to approximately $19 million of higher employee-related expenses, approximately $7 million of higher product development expense, approximately $2 million of higher infrastructure-related expense and approximately $1 million of net increases in other research and development costs. The increase in employee-related expenses was attributable to approximately $14 million of higher salary and related expenses, approximately $2 million of higher stock-based compensation expense and approximately $3 million of higher combined expense in connection with our company-wide bonus program and employee travel, training and related expenses. Our 2017 research and development expenses included approximately $17 million of expense attributable to GENBAND, primarily comprised of approximately $9 million of employee-related expenses, approximately $5 million of product development costs, approximately $1 million of depreciation expense and approximately $1 million of infrastructure expense.\nOn August 3, 2018 (the \"Edgewater Acquisition Date\"), we completed our acquisition of Edgewater Networks, Inc. (\"Edgewater\"), a private company headquartered in San Jose, California (the \"Edgewater Acquisition\"). Edgewater is a market leader in Network Edge Orchestration for the small and medium enterprise and UC market. We believe that the acquisition of Edgewater will allow us to offer our global customer base a complete core-to-edge product portfolio, end-to-end service assurance and analytics solutions, and a fully integrated SD-WAN service.\nAcquisition- and Integration-Related Expenses. Acquisition- and integration-related expenses include those expenses related to acquisitions that we would otherwise not have incurred. Acquisition-related expenses include professional and services fees, such as legal, audit, consulting, paying agent and other fees, and expenses related to cash payments to certain former executives of the acquired businesses in connection with their employment agreements. Integration-related expenses represent incremental costs related to combining the Company's systems and processes with those of acquired businesses,\nOur deferred product revenue was approximately $22 million at December 31, 2017 and approximately $7 million at December 31, 2016. Our deferred service revenue was approximately $93 million at December 31, 2017 and approximately $44 million at December 31, 2016.\n\nAcquisition- and Integration-Related Expenses. We recorded approximately $15 million of acquisition- and integration-related expenses in the year ended December 31, 2017, comprised of approximately $13 million of acquisition-related expense and approximately $2 million of integration-related expense. The acquisition-related expense was comprised of approximately $12 million for professional services fees and $1 million related to cash payments to certain former GENBAND executives. We recorded approximately $1 million of acquisition-related expenses in 2016 in connection with the acquisition of Taqua.\nWe write down our inventories if they are considered to be obsolete or at levels in excess of forecasted demand. In these cases, inventory is written down to estimated realizable value based on historical usage and expected demand. Inherent in our estimates of market value in determining inventory valuation are estimates related to economic trends, future demand for our products and technical obsolescence of our products. If future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our\nAt December 31, 2018, we had valuation allowances of approximately $82 million to offset net domestic deferred tax assets of approximately $83 million. In addition, we had valuation allowances to offset Canada federal credits carryovers of approximately $10 million and Ireland net deferred tax assets of $10 million. In the event we determine it is more likely than not that we will be able to use a deferred tax asset in the future in excess of its net carrying value, the valuation allowance would be reduced, thereby increasing net earnings and increasing equity in the period such determination is made. We have recorded net deferred tax assets in some of our international subsidiaries. These amounts could change in future periods based upon our operating results and changes in tax law.\nOur financing activities provided approximately $32 million of cash in 2018 and used approximately $4 million of cash in 2017 and $10 million in 2016. The 2018 amount was primarily comprised of approximately $35 million of net borrowings against our Credit Facility, partially offset by approximately $2 million used to pay withholding obligations related to the net share settlement of restricted and performance-based stock grants upon vesting and approximately $1 million in the aggregate used to make principal payments on our capital lease obligations and debt issuance costs related to our Credit Facility. The 2017 amount was primarily comprised of approximately $8 million used to pay withholding obligations related to the net share settlement of restricted and performance-based stock grants upon vesting and $1 million to pay debt issuance costs related to our Credit Facility, partially offset by approximately $2 million of net borrowings against our Credit Facility, $1 million of proceeds from the sale of our common stock in connection with our Amended and Restated 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended, and approximately $1 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options. The 2016 amount was primarily comprised of approximately $10 million used for the repurchase of common stock under our stock buyback program.\nWe recorded restructuring expense of approximately $17 million in 2018, comprised of approximately $16 million in connection with our Merger Restructuring Initiative and approximately $1 million for changes in estimated costs in connection with our assumption of GENBAND's restructuring liability at the time of Merger.\n__________________________________\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting (\"ASU 2017-09\"), which amends the scope of modification accounting for share-based payment arrangements such that an entity would not apply modification accounting if the fair value, vesting conditions and classification of the awards are the same immediately before and after the modification. ASU 2017-09 became effective for us beginning January 1, 2018 for both interim and annual reporting periods. The adoption of ASU 2017-09 did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.\nOther Income, Net. Other income, net, in 2017 of approximately $1 million was primarily comprised of the gain on the sale of an intangible asset and foreign currency gains. Other income, net, in 2016 of approximately $1 million was primarily comprised of gains from the sale of intangible assets.\n\nThe following customers each contributed 10% or more of our revenue in at least one of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nBusiness Acquisitions\nOn December 21, 2017, we entered into a Senior Secured Credit Agreement (as amended, the Credit Facility\u201d) with SVB, which refinanced the Prior Credit Agreement. The Credit Facility includes $100 million of commitments, the full amount of which is available for revolving loans, a $15 million sublimit that is available for letters of credit and a $15 million sublimit that is available for swingline loans. The Credit Facility is scheduled to mature in December 2021, subject to a springing maturity if, on or before July 14, 2020, the existing promissory note issued to certain shareholders is not converted or extended to March 2022 or later. The Credit Facility contains procedures for additional financial institutions to become lenders, or for any existing lender to increase its commitment under the facility, subject to an available increase of $50 million for all incremental commitments under the Credit Facility without amendment. On June 24, 2018, we amended the Credit Facility to, among other things, permit the Edgewater Acquisition and related transactions.\nResults of Operations\nAcquisition- and integration-related expenses are reported separately in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (\"ASU 2018-02\"), which amends ASC 220, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income, to allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive\noutstanding immediately prior to the closing date of the Merger, such that former stockholders of Sonus would own approximately 50%, and former shareholders of GENBAND and the two related holding companies would own approximately 50%, of the shares of NewCo common stock issued and outstanding immediately following the consummation of the Merger.\nThe timing of the completion of customer projects and revenue recognition criteria satisfaction may cause our product revenue to fluctuate from one period to the next.\n\nOn December 21, 2017, concurrently with the completion of the Credit Facility, we repaid in full all outstanding amounts under the Prior Credit Agreement and terminated the agreement. We did not incur any early termination penalties in connection with the termination of the Prior Credit Agreement.\n \nOur product revenue is generated from sales of software with attached appliances, software licenses and software subscription fees. Certain of our products may be included in more than one of our solutions (session solutions, network transformation solutions, and applications and security solutions), dependent upon the configuration of the individual customer solutions sold. Our software with attached appliances and software license revenues are primarily comprised of our media gateway, call controller, signaling, virtual mobile core and management (i.e., analytics, assurance, billing, etc.) products. Our software subscription fees revenue is primarily comprised of sales of our UC-related (i.e., application server, media server, etc.), Kandy Cloud and Ribbon Protect products. All three of our solutions portfolios address both the service provider and enterprise markets and are sold through both our direct sales program and from indirect sales through our channel partner program.\nOur 2018 operating expenses included approximately $17 million of acquisition- and integration-related expenses, primarily related to the Merger and, to a lesser extent, to the recent acquisition of Edgewater, and approximately $17 million of restructuring expense, primarily related to severance and related costs.\nService revenue includes revenue from customer support and other professional services. We offer warranties on our products. Certain of our warranties are considered to be assurance-type in nature and do not cover anything beyond ensuring that the product is functioning as intended. Based on the guidance in ASC 606, assurance-type warranties do not represent separate performance obligations. We also sell separately-priced maintenance service contracts which qualify as service-type warranties and represent separate performance obligations. We do not allow and have no history of accepting product returns.\nOur revenue was approximately $578 million in 2018, $330 million in 2017 and $253 million in 2016. Our gross profit was approximately $308 million in 2018, $201 million in 2017 and $168 million in 2016. Our gross profit as a percentage of revenue (\"total gross margin\") was approximately 53% in 2018, 61% in 2017 and 66% in 2016.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract ( ASU 2018-15\u201d), which provides guidance on implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement ( CCA\u201d) that is a service contract. ASU 2018-15 amends ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other ( ASC 350\u201d) to include in its scope implementation costs of a CCA that is a service contract and clarifies that a customer should apply the guidance in ASC 350-40 to determine which implementation costs should be capitalized in such a CCA. ASU 2018-15 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2020. We are currently assessing the potential impact of the adoption of ASU 2018-15 on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe have provided for income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 31, 2018, with the exception of the Company's Irish subsidiary, as we do not plan to permanently reinvest these amounts outside the U.S. The repatriation of the undistributed earnings would result in withholding taxes imposed on the repatriation. Consequently, we have recorded a tax liability of $4.5 million, consisting of potential withholding and distribution taxes related to undistributed earnings from these subsidiaries as of December 31, 2018. Had the earnings of the Irish subsidiary been determined to not be permanently reinvested outside the U.S., no additional deferred tax liability would be required due to no withholding taxes or income tax expense being imposed on such repatriation.\nWe are charged a commitment fee ranging from 0.25% to 0.40% per year on the daily amount of the unused portions of the commitments under the Credit Facility. Additionally, with respect to all letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility, we are charged a fronting fee of 0.125% per year and an outstanding letter of credit fee equal to the Applicable Margin for base rate loans ranging from 1.50% to 2.00% times the amount of the outstanding letters of credit.\nContractual Obligations\nBusiness Combinations. We allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed and represents the expected future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in the business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. Significant management judgments and assumptions are required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, particularly acquired intangible assets which are principally based upon estimates of the future performance and cash flows expected from the acquired business and applied discount rates. While we use our best estimates and assumptions as part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at a business combination date, our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. If different assumptions are used, it could materially impact the purchase price allocation and our financial position and results of operations. Any adjustments to assets acquired or liabilities assumed subsequent to the purchase price allocation period are included in operating results in the period in which the adjustments are determined. Intangible assets typically are comprised of in-process research and development, developed technology, customer relationships, trade names and internal use software.\n\nThe decrease in product gross margin in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the inclusion of GENBAND product costs for the full year in 2018 compared to the inclusion of two months of GENBAND product costs in 2017, including the amortization of intangible assets arising from the Merger, which decreased our product gross margin by approximately six percentage points, coupled with product and customer mix, which also decreased our product gross margin by approximately six percentage points.\n\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial position, changes in financial position, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nFinancial Overview\nRevenue earned from customers domiciled outside the United States was approximately 42% of revenue in 2018 and approximately 34% of revenue in 2017. Due to the timing of project completions, we expect that the domestic and international components as a percentage of our revenue may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year.\nAlthough we have eliminated positions as part of our restructuring initiatives, we continue to hire in certain areas that we believe are important to our future growth. Restructuring expense is reported separately in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOur purchases of materials and components for manufacture increased in 2018 compared with 2017 due to the inclusion of GENBAND's operations since October 27, 2017 in our consolidated results. We expect our future purchases of materials and components to decrease as a result of the increase in software content of our products both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our revenue.\nIn March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Post Retirement Benefit Cost (\"ASU 2017-07\"). ASU 2017-07 amends the requirements in ASC 715, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (\"ASC 715\") to require entities to disaggregate the current-service-cost component from the other components of net benefit cost (the \"other components\") and include it with other current compensation costs for related employees, present the other components elsewhere in the income statement and outside of income from operations if such a subtotal is presented and disclose the income statement lines that contain the other components if they are not presented on appropriately described separate lines. ASU 2017-07 became effective for us beginning January 1, 2018 for both interim and annual reporting periods. The adoption of ASU 2017-07 did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.\nincome to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Act and requires entities to provide certain disclosures regarding stranded tax effects. ASU 2018-02 became effective for us beginning January 1, 2019.\nLoss Contingencies and Reserves. We are subject to ongoing business risks arising in the ordinary course of business that affect the estimation process of the carrying value of assets, the recording of liabilities and the possibility of various loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to determine whether such amounts should be adjusted and record changes in estimates in the period they become known. We are subject to various legal claims. We reserve for legal contingencies and legal fees when the amounts are probable and reasonably estimable.\nThe Merger has been accounted for as a business combination and the financial results of GENBAND have been included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on the Merger Date. On November 28, 2017, the Company changed its name to \"Ribbon Communications Inc.\"\nThe software licenses typically provide a perpetual right to use our software. We also sell term-based software licenses that expire and Software-as-as-Service (\"SaaS\")-based software which are referred to as subscription arrangements. We do not customize our software nor are installation services required, as the customer has a right to utilize internal resources or a third-party service company. The software and appliances are delivered before related services are provided and are functional without professional services or customer support. We have concluded that our software licenses are functional intellectual property that are distinct, as the user can benefit from the software on its own. The product revenue is typically recognized upon transfer of control or when the software is made available for download, as this is the point that the user of the software can direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the functional intellectual property. We do not recognize software revenue related to the renewal of subscription software licenses earlier than the beginning of the subscription period. Appliance products are generally sold with software to provide the customer solution.\nThe indebtedness and other obligations under the Credit Facility are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by us and each of our other material U.S. domestic subsidiaries (collectively, the \"Guarantors\"). The Credit Agreement is secured by first-priority liens on substantially all of our assets.\n\nOn July 25, 2016, we announced a program (the \"2016 Restructuring Initiative\") to further accelerate our investment in new technologies as the communications industry migrates to a cloud-based architecture and pursues new strategic initiatives, such as new products and an expanded go-to-market footprint in selected geographies and discrete vertical markets. We have recorded an aggregate of approximately $2 million of restructuring expense in connection with this initiative, primarily for severance and related costs. The amounts accrued for severance and related costs were fully paid in 2017. We expect that the amounts accrued for facilities will be paid by the end of 2019.\n\nInterest expense in both 2018 and 2017 was primarily comprised of interest on the related party promissory note issued in connection with the Merger, the outstanding revolving credit facility balance, the amortization of debt issuance costs in connection with our revolving credit facilities and interest on capital lease obligations. Interest income consisted of interest earned on our cash equivalents, marketable securities and investments. The higher interest expense in 2018 compared with 2017 was primarily due to the promissory note and credit facility balances outstanding for the full year 2018, compared to approximately two months in 2017. The decrease in interest income in 2018 compared with 2017 was primarily due to the lower amounts available for investment in 2018.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had an outstanding debt balance of $55 million at a weighted average interest rate of 5.96% and approximately $3 million of outstanding letters of credit at an interest rate of 1.75% under the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2017, we had an outstanding debt balance of $20 million at an interest rate of 4.51% and approximately $3 million of outstanding letters of credit at an interest rate of 2.00% under the Credit Facility.\nService revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was comprised of the following (in millions, except percentages): \nThe following customer contributed 10% or more of our revenue in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nWe offer customer training courses, for which the related revenue is typically recognized as the training services are performed.\nYears Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nInterest income consisted of interest earned on our cash equivalents, marketable securities and investments. Interest expense in 2017 was primarily comprised of interest on the outstanding revolving credit facility balance assumed in connection with the acquisition of GENBAND, amortization of debt issuance costs in connection with our revolving credit facilities and interest on capital lease obligations. Interest expense in 2016 was comprised of expense related to the amortization of debt issuance costs in connection with our revolving credit facility and expense related to interest on capital lease obligations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nCost of Revenue/Gross Margin. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of amounts paid to third-party manufacturers for purchased materials and services, royalties and manufacturing and services personnel and related costs. Our cost of revenue and gross margins for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in millions, except percentages):\nEdgewater Networks, Inc.\nIncome Taxes. We recorded a benefit for income taxes of approximately $18 million in 2017 and a provision for income taxes of approximately $3 million in 2016. The benefit recorded in 2017 was primarily the result of the release of an approximately $16 million domestic valuation allowance as a result of net deferred tax liabilities acquired as part of the GENBAND acquisition. The expense recorded in 2016 was primarily related to foreign operations. During 2017 and 2016,\nOur product revenue increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the inclusion of GENBAND's product revenue for the full year in 2018 compared to the inclusion of two months of GENBAND's product revenue in 2017. Product revenue from sales of our software with attached appliances and software licenses contributed approximately $85 million in the aggregate to the increase in our product revenue in 2018, coupled with approximately $13 million of higher 2018 product revenue from sales of our software subscriptions.\nThe amount of stock-based compensation expense recorded in any period for unvested awards requires estimates of the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited prior to vesting, as well as assumptions regarding the probability that performance-based stock awards without market conditions will be earned.\nOn September 26, 2016 (the \"Taqua Acquisition Date\"), we acquired Taqua, LLC (\"Taqua\"), a leading supplier of IP communications systems, applications and services to mobile and fixed operators. Taqua enables the transformation of software-based service provider networks to deliver next-generation voice, video and messaging services, including VoIP, VoWiFi and VoLTE. The financial results of Taqua are included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on the Taqua Acquisition Date.\nIn connection with the Merger, on October 27, 2017, we issued a promissory note for approximately $23 million to certain of GENBAND's equity holders (the \"Promissory Note\"). The Promissory Note does not amortize and the principal thereon is payable in full on the third anniversary of its execution. Interest on the promissory note is payable quarterly in arrears and accrued at a rate of 7.5% per year for the first six months after issuance, and thereafter at a rate of 10% per year. The failure to make any payment under the Promissory Note when due and, with respect to payment of any interest, the continuation of such failure for a period of thirty days thereafter, constitutes an event of default under the Promissory Note. If an event of default occurs under the Promissory Note, the payees may declare the entire balance of the Promissory Note due and payable (including principal and accrued and unpaid interest) within five business days of the payees' notification to the Company of such acceleration. Interest that is not paid on the interest payment date will increase the principal amount of the Promissory Note. At December 31, 2018, the Promissory Note balance was $24.1 million, comprised of $22.5 million of principal plus $1.6 million of interest converted to principal.\nOther (Expense) Income, Net. Other expense, net, in 2018 of approximately $4 million was primarily comprised of foreign currency losses. Other income, net, in 2017 of approximately $1 million was primarily comprised of the gain on the sale of an intangible asset and foreign currency gains.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. Intangible assets with estimated lives and other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of intangible assets with estimated lives and other long-lived assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to future net undiscounted pretax cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If these comparisons indicate that an asset is not recoverable, we will recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the related estimated fair value.\nAs a result of the Merger, we believe we are better positioned to enable network transformations to IP and to cloud-based networks for service providers and enterprise customers worldwide, with a broader and deeper sales footprint, increased ability to invest in growth, more efficient and effective research and development, and a comprehensive RTC product offering.\nWe expect that our service revenue in 2019 will increase compared with 2018 levels, primarily due to the inclusion of revenue attributable to our acquisition of Edgewater and the continued organic growth of our installed customer base. However, we expect to continue to encounter ongoing industry pricing pressure, third-party competition and legacy network product decommissioning.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (in millions, except percentages):\nOur cash, cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments totaled approximately $51 million at December 31, 2018 and $83 million at December 31, 2017. We had cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries aggregating approximately $11 million at December 31, 2018 and $14 million at December 31, 2017. If we elect to repatriate all of the funds held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 31, 2018, we do not believe that the amounts of potential withholding taxes that would arise from the repatriation would have a material effect on our liquidity.\nOn February 28, 2019, we acquired the business and technology assets of Anova Data, Inc. (\"Anova\"), a provider of advanced analytics solutions, for total purchase consideration of 3.3 million shares of our common stock. Anova is based in the U.S., and its NextGen products provide a cloud-native, streaming analytics platform for network and subscriber optimization and monetization. We believe that the proposed acquisition reinforces and extends our strategy to expand into network optimization, security and data monetization via big data analytics and machine learning. We do not expect that the acquisition will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in 2019.\nRevenue. Revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was as follows (in millions, except percentages):\nWe derive revenue from two primary sources: products (software and non-software products) and services. Software and non-software product revenue is generated from sales of our software with proprietary appliances that function together to deliver the products' essential functionality. Software and appliances are also sold on a standalone basis. Services include customer support (software updates and technical support), consulting, design services, installation services and training. A\nIn addition, the FASB has issued the following accounting pronouncements, none of which we believe will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements:\nWe recorded net restructuring expense of approximately $9 million in 2017, comprised of approximately $9 million in connection with our Merger Restructuring Initiative, less than $1 million in connection with our Taqua Restructuring Initiative and less than $1 million in connection with our 2016 Restructuring Initiative. The net restructuring expense recorded included reversals for changes in estimated costs totaling less than $1 million in the aggregate in connection with the GENBAND Restructuring Initiative, the Taqua Restructuring Initiative and the 2016 Restructuring Initiative.\nThe Credit Facility requires compliance with certain financial covenants, including a minimum consolidated quick ratio, minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and maximum consolidated leverage ratio, all of which are defined in the Credit Agreement and tested on a quarterly basis. In addition, the Credit Facility contains various covenants that, among other restrictions, limit our and our subsidiaries' ability to enter into certain types of transactions, including, but not limited to: incurring or assuming indebtedness, making acquisitions or engaging in mergers, making investments, repurchasing equity and paying dividends, selling or otherwise transferring assets, changing the nature of our business and amending or making prepayments on certain junior debt. We were in compliance with all covenants of the Credit Facility at December 31, 2018 and 2017.", "item_7_text": "\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses and prototype costs for the design, development, testing and enhancement of our products. Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in millions, except percentages):\nOur consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized as follows (in millions):\n\nsuch as third-party consulting and other third-party services. We recorded approximately $17 million of acquisition- and integration-related expenses in 2018, comprised of $10 million of acquisition-related expenses and approximately $7 million of integration-related expenses. The acquisition-related expense primarily related to the Merger, with nominal amounts related to the acquisition of Edgewater and other acquisition-related activities. We recorded approximately $15 million of acquisition- and integration-related expenses in 2017, comprised of approximately $13 million of acquisition-related expense and approximately $2 million of integration-related expense. The acquisition-related expense was comprised of approximately $12 million for professional services fees and $1 million related to cash payments to certain former GENBAND executives. We estimate that we will incur additional integration-related expense in 2019 approximating $3 million.\nSales and Marketing Expenses. Sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (in millions, except percentages):\nwe performed an analysis to determine if, based on all available evidence, we considered it more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in a future period. As a result of our evaluations, we concluded that there was insufficient positive evidence to overcome the more objective negative evidence related to our cumulative losses and other factors. Accordingly, we maintained a valuation against our domestic deferred tax asset. A similar analysis and conclusion were made with regard to the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets of our Irish subsidiary. In analyzing the deferred tax assets related to our Canada subsidiaries, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the Canadian federal SRED credits would not be realized in a future period.\nOur 2016 operating expenses included approximately $1 million of acquisition- and integration-related costs for professional and services fees related to our acquisition of Taqua and approximately $3 million of restructuring expense. Our 2016 restructuring expense was primarily related to severance and related costs.\nWe believe that our general and administrative expenses will decrease in 2019 compared with 2018, primarily due to savings from our restructuring and integration cost savings initiatives.\nRevenue Recognition. We account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASC 606\"), which we adopted on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method.\nEntities must apply the guidance retrospectively to all periods presented but may apply it prospectively from the earliest date practicable if retrospective application would be impracticable. The adoption of ASU 2016-15 did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.\nThe decrease in product gross margin in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to the inclusion of GENBAND for the period following the Merger Date, which decreased our product gross margin by approximately seven percentage points, and impairment expense of approximately $6 million related to the write-off of one of our previously acquired developed technology intangible assets, which decreased our product gross margin by approximately four percentage points. These decreases were partially offset by the impact of our product and customer mix, particularly sales of certain of our security and applications products, which increased our product gross margin by approximately five percentage points in 2017.\nOur 2017 operating expenses included approximately $15 million of acquisition- and integration-related expenses, nearly all related to the Merger, and approximately $9 million of restructuring expense. Our 2017 restructuring expense was primarily related to severance and related costs.\nSome aspects of our research and development efforts require significant short-term expenditures, the timing of which may cause significant variability in our expenses. We believe that rapid technological innovation is critical to our long-term success, and we are tailoring our investments to meet the requirements of our customers and market. We believe that our research and development expenses in 2019 will increase from 2018 levels due to our continued increased investment in our software solutions and the impact of Edgewater's research and development expenses for the full year 2019, partially offset by\nWe assess the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary valuation allowances as required. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative income in the most recent years, changes in the business in which we operate and our forecast of future taxable income. In determining future taxable income, we are responsible for assumptions utilized, including the amount of state, federal and international pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage our underlying businesses. Such assessment is completed on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis.\nRestructuring and Cost Reduction Initiatives\nFinancial Results\nThe rate at which we will consume cash will be dependent on the cash needs of future operations, including changes in working capital, which will, in turn, be directly affected by the levels of demand for our products, the timing and rate of expansion of our business, the resources we devote to developing our products and any litigation settlements. We anticipate devoting substantial capital resources to continue our research and development efforts, to maintain our sales, support and marketing, to complete merger-related integration activities and for other general corporate activities. However, it is difficult to predict future liquidity requirements with certainty. See Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our other contingencies.\nInterest (Expense) Income, net. Interest expense and interest income for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in millions, except percentages):\npercentages):\n * Includes restructuring payments aggregating approximately $1 million, approximately 50% of which is due in less than one year and the remainder is due in one to three years. Excludes current estimated sublease income aggregating approximately $125,000 over the remaining lease terms of the restructured facilities. \nService revenue is primarily comprised of appliance and software maintenance and support ( maintenance revenue\u201d) and network design, installation and other professional services ( professional services revenue\u201d).\nThe Credit Facility requires periodic interest payments on outstanding borrowings until maturity. We may prepay all revolving loans under the Credit Facility at any time without premium or penalty (other than customary LIBOR breakage costs), subject to certain notice requirements.\nIn 2018, approximately 25% of our product revenue was from indirect sales through our channel partner program, compared to approximately 24% in 2017.\nJudgment is required in determining whether an event has occurred that may impair the value of goodwill or identifiable intangible or other long-lived assets. Factors that could indicate an impairment may exist include significant underperformance\nWe completed our accounting for the effects of the Tax Act in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the effects of the Tax Act were reflected in in our 2018 tax provision. We considered the impact of the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (\"BEAT\"), the GILTI, the deduction for foreign derived intangible income and other provisions of the Tax Act when preparing our 2018 tax provision. Based on this analysis, we recorded BEAT tax expense of $0.4 million in 2018 and recorded an adjustment to the provisional amounts previously recorded related to the Tax Act that decreased our deferred tax assets by $0.2 million.\n ** Debt obligations - principal represents both our Promissory Note payable of $24.1 million and the outstanding balance on our Credit Facility of $55.0 million at December 31, 2018. We periodically make payments and borrow on the revolving credit facility, and accordingly, we have included it in current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. However, we have reported the outstanding balance payment due in the table above in the \"3-5 years\" column based solely on the expiration date of the Credit Facility. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nSales and Marketing Expenses. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs, commissions, travel and entertainment expenses, promotions, customer trial and evaluations inventory and other marketing and sales support expenses. Sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in millions, except percentages):\nrelative to plan or long-term projections, strategic changes in business strategy, significant negative industry or economic trends, a significant change in circumstances relative to a large customer, a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and a decline in our market capitalization to below net book value. We must make assumptions about future control premiums, market comparables, cash flows, operating plans, discount rates and other factors to determine recoverability.\nBased on our current expectations, we believe our current cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and available borrowings under the Credit Agreement will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least twelve months. However, we cannot be sure that our current cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and available borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our future needs. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows in the future, and if availability under our credit facility is not sufficient to support our\nlikely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in a future period. As a result of our evaluations, we concluded that there was insufficient positive evidence to overcome the more objective negative evidence related to our cumulative losses and other factors. Accordingly, we maintained a valuation against our domestic deferred tax asset. A similar analysis and conclusion were made with regard to the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets of our Irish subsidiary. In analyzing the deferred tax assets related to our Canada subsidiaries, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the Canadian federal credits would not be realized in a future period.\nThe Credit Facility contains events of default that are customary for a secured credit facility. If an event of default relating to bankruptcy or other insolvency events with respect to a borrower occurs, all obligations under the Credit Facility will immediately become due and payable. If any other event of default exists under the Credit Facility, the lenders may accelerate the maturity of the obligations outstanding under the Credit Facility and exercise other rights and remedies, including charging a default rate of interest equal to 2.00% per year above the rate that would otherwise be applicable. In addition, if any event of default exists under the Credit Facility, the lenders may commence foreclosure or other actions against the collateral.\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to the customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment.\nWe reported losses from operations of approximately $65 million for 2018, $55 million for 2017 and $14 million for 2016. We reported net losses of approximately $77 million for 2018, $35 million for 2017 and $14 million for 2016.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (in millions, except percentages):\nOur operating expenses were approximately $374 million in 2018, compared to approximately $257 million in 2017 and approximately $181 million in 2016.\nThe increase in our professional services revenue in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to the inclusion of approximately $10 million of revenue attributable to GENBAND in 2017 for the period following the Merger Date, coupled with an increase in the volume of network transformation solutions projects completed in 2017 compared to 2016.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement ( ASU 2018-13\u201d), which changes the fair value measurement requirements of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement ( ASC 820\u201d). ASU 2018-13 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2020 for both interim and annual reporting.\nOur professional services include consulting, technical support, resident engineer services, design services and installation services. Because control transfers over time, revenue is recognized based on progress toward completion of the performance obligation. The method to measure progress toward completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. We generally use the input method to measure progress for our contracts because we believe it best depicts the transfer of assets to the customer which occurs as we incur costs for the contracts. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the progress toward completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. When the measure of progress is based upon expended labor, progress toward completion is measured as the ratio of labor time expended to date versus the total estimated labor time required to complete the performance obligation. Revenue is recorded proportionally as costs are incurred or as labor is expended. Costs to fulfill these obligations include internal labor as well as subcontractor costs.\nOur operating activities used approximately $10 million of cash in 2018 and provided approximately $8 million of cash in 2017 and $19 million of cash in 2016.\nCash used in operating activities in 2018 was primarily the result of lower accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities and accounts payable, coupled with higher accounts receivable and other operating assets. These were partially offset by higher deferred revenue, lower inventory, and the net impact of non-cash items against our net loss. The decrease in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities is primarily related to lower accruals for taxes and professional fees. The decrease in accounts payable relates to the timing and amounts of purchases of both services and tangible goods and their related payment arrangements. The increase in accounts receivable primarily relates to the Edgewater Acquisition. Deferred revenue balances may fluctuate as a result of the timing of invoicing and revenue recognition. Our net loss, adjusted for non-cash items such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes and other non-cash items, including foreign currency exchange losses, was virtually break-even.\nOn October 27, 2017 (the \"Merger Date\"), Sonus Networks, Inc. (\"Sonus\") consummated an acquisition as specified in an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d) with Solstice Sapphire Investments, Inc. (\"NewCo\") and certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, GENBAND Holdings Company, GENBAND Inc. and GENBAND II, INC. (collectively, \"GENBAND\") such that, following a series of mergers (collectively, the \"Merger\"), Sonus and GENBAND each became a wholly-owned subsidiary of NewCo.\nCost of Revenue/Gross Margin. Cost of revenue and gross margins for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (in millions, except percentages):\nAccounting for Income Taxes. Our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion. The current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for 2018. We provide for deferred income taxes resulting from temporary differences between financial and taxable income. Such differences arise primarily from tax net operating loss (\"NOL\") and credit carryforwards, depreciation, deferred revenue, stock-based compensation expense, accruals and reserves.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory (\"ASU 2016-16\"), which removes the prohibition in ASC 740, Income Taxes, against the immediate recognition of the current and deferred income tax effects of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. ASU 2016-16 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2019 for both interim and annual reporting periods.\nOn November 13, 2018, we announced that we intended to offer, subject to market conditions and other factors, $150 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2023 in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We expected to grant the initial purchasers a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $25 million aggregate principal amount of such notes, solely to cover over-allotments, if any. On that same day, we decided not to proceed with our previously-announced offering and consequently did not sell any securities as part of such offering. We believed that then-current market conditions were not conducive for an offering on terms that would be in the best interests of our stockholders. In connection with this offering, we incurred $1 million of expense, primarily for professional fees, which is included as a component of General and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\nRevolving loans under the Credit Facility bear interest at our option at either the Eurodollar (LIBOR) rate plus a margin ranging from 2.50% to 3.00% per year or the base rate (the highest of the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, or the prime rate announced from time to time in The Wall Street Journal) plus a margin ranging from 1.50% to 2.00% per year (such margins being referred to as the Applicable Margin\u201d). The Applicable Margin varies depending on our consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The base rate and the LIBOR rate are each subject to a zero percent floor.\nSonus maintained a credit facility by and among Sonus, as Borrower, Bank of America, N.A. (\"Bank of America\"), as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer, and the other lenders from time to time party thereto entered into on June 27, 2014 (as amended, the \"Sonus Credit Agreement\"). The Sonus Credit Agreement expired by its terms on June 30, 2017 and was not renewed.\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, the Company may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nYears Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nThe increase in sales and marketing expenses in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to the inclusion of GENBAND's expenses, aggregating approximately $14 million, for the 2017 period following the Merger Date, primarily comprised of approximately $10 million of employee-related expenses, $3 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets and $2 million of infrastructure-related expense.\nWe believe that our sales and marketing expenses will be essentially flat in 2019 compared with 2018, as we expect the inclusion of Edgewater's sales and marketing expenses for the full year 2019 will be offset by cost savings from our ongoing restructuring and integration cost savings initiatives.\n\nOur contractual obligations at December 31, 2018 consisted of the following (in millions):\n\nThe decrease in service gross margin in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to the inclusion of GENBAND expenses for the period following the Merger Date, which decreased our service gross margin by approximately four percentage points. Although service revenue increased by approximately $43 million in 2017 compared to 2016, the increase in service costs of approximately $21 million contributed to the decline in gross margin. Our service cost of revenue is relatively fixed in advance of any particular quarter and therefore, changes in service revenue will typically have a significant impact on service gross margins.\nRestructuring Expense. We have been committed to streamlining operations and reducing operating costs by closing and consolidating certain facilities and reducing our worldwide workforce. Please see the additional discussion of our restructuring initiatives in the \"Restructuring and Cost Reduction Initiatives\" section of the Overview of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe increase in product revenue in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily the result of the inclusion of GENBAND's product revenue for the period following the Merger Date. Revenue from sales of our software with attached appliances and software licenses contributed approximately $32 million in the aggregate to the increase in product revenue in 2017, coupled with approximately $3 million of higher 2017 product revenue from sales of our software subscriptions.\nService revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was comprised of the following (in millions, except\nWe are a leading provider of next generation (\"NextGen\") software solutions to telecommunications, wireless and cable service providers and enterprises across industry verticals.

Our software solutions provide a secure way for our customers to connect and leverage multivendor, multiprotocol communications systems and applications across their networks and the cloud, around the world and in a rapidly changing ecosystem of IP-enabled devices, such as smartphones and tablets. In addition, our software solutions secure cloud-based delivery of UC solutions - both for service providers transforming to a cloud-based network and for enterprises using cloud-based UC. We sell our software solutions through both direct sales and indirect channels globally, leveraging the assistance of resellers, and we provide ongoing support to our customers through a global services team with experience in design, deployment and maintenance of some of the world's largest software IP networks.\nOur deferred product revenue was approximately $14 million at December 31, 2018 and approximately $22 million at December 31, 2017. Our deferred service revenue was approximately $108 million at December 31, 2018 and approximately $93 million at December 31, 2017. Our deferred revenue balance may fluctuate as a result of the timing of revenue recognition, customer payments, maintenance contract renewals, contractual billing rights and maintenance revenue deferrals included in multiple element arrangements.\nStock-Based Compensation. Our stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period.\nThe increase in research and development expenses in 2018 compared to 2017 was attributable to approximately $18 million of higher employee-related expenses, approximately $14 million of higher product development expense (i.e., third-party development, prototype and test equipment costs) and approximately $12 million of higher infrastructure-related expense. The increase in employee-related expenses was primarily attributable to approximately $23 million of higher salary and related expenses, including our company-wide cash bonus program, partially offset by approximately $5 million of lower stock-based compensation expense. These increases were primarily attributable to the inclusion of GENBAND research and development expenses for the full year in 2018 compared to the inclusion of two months of GENBAND research and development expenses in 2017, partially offset by the cost reductions realized from our recent restructuring initiatives. Our research and development expenses in 2018 also included approximately $5 million of expense attributable to Edgewater since the Edgewater Acquisition Date, primarily for employee- and infrastructure-related expenses.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General (Subtopic 715-20): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans ( ASU 2018-14\u201d), which amends ASC 715 to add, remove and clarify disclosure requirements related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. ASU 2018-14 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2020.\n *** This liability is not subject to fixed payment terms and the amount and timing of payments, if any, that we will make related to this liability are not known. See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. \nRevenue. Revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was as follows (in millions, except percentages):\nIn July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-09, Codification Improvements ( ASU 2018-09\u201d), which contains amendments to clarify, correct errors in or make minor improvements to the Codification. ASU 2018-09 makes improvements to multiple topics, including but not limited to comprehensive income, debt, income taxes related to both stock-based compensation and business combinations, fair value measurement and defined contribution benefit plans. ASU 2018-09 became effective for us beginning January 1, 2019.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to: reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%; requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries; generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; requiring a current inclusion in U.S. federal taxable income of certain earnings (Global Intangible Low-taxed Income) (\"GILTI\") of controlled foreign corporations; eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (\"AMT\") and changing how existing AMT credits can be realized; creating the base erosion anti-abuse tax; creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense; changing rules related to uses and limitations of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017; providing a tax deduction for foreign-derived intangible income; and changing rules related to deductibility of compensation for certain officers.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs for executive and administrative personnel, and audit, legal and other professional fees. General and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in millions, except percentages):\nCustomer support includes software updates on a when-and-if-available basis, telephone support, integrated web-based support and bug fixes or patches. We sell our customer support contracts at a percentage of list or net product price related to the support. Customer support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the customer support agreement, which is typically one year.\nOur 2017 general and administrative expenses included approximately $5 million of expense attributable to GENBAND for the period following the Merger Date. The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2017 compared to 2016 was attributable to approximately $10 million of higher employee-related expenses, approximately $3 million of higher professional fees and approximately $2 million of expense accrued for potential fines in connection with the then-ongoing SEC investigation. These increases were partially offset by approximately $3 million of lower infrastructure costs.\nIn 2018, approximately 21% of our product revenue was attributable to sales to enterprise customers, compared to approximately 20% in 2017. These sales were made through both our direct sales team and indirect sales channel partners.\nWe recorded stock-based compensation expense of approximately $11 million in 2018, $26 million in 2017 and $20 million in 2016. The expense recorded in 2017 includes approximately $9 million of incremental expense related to the acceleration of stock options and certain full value stock awards in connection with the Merger.\nDuring 2018 and 2017, we performed an analysis to determine if, based on all available evidence, we considered it more\nprojections, additional inventory write-downs could be required and would be reflected in the cost of revenue in the period the revision is made. To date, we have not been required to revise any of our assumptions or estimates used in determining our inventory valuations.\nIn connection with the acquisition of Taqua, we implemented a restructuring plan in the third quarter of 2016 to eliminate certain redundant positions within the combined companies. On October 24, 2016, the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors (the \"Audit Committee\") approved a broader Taqua restructuring plan related to headcount and redundant facilities (collectively, the \"Taqua Restructuring Initiative\"). In connection with this initiative, we have recorded approximately $2 million of restructuring expense for severance and related costs and estimated costs related to the elimination of redundant facilities, including adjustments recorded for changes in cost estimates for the planned restructuring activities. The actions under the Taqua Restructuring Initiative have been implemented and accordingly, we do not expect to record additional expense in connection with this initiative. The amounts accrued for severance and related costs were fully paid by the end of the third quarter of 2017. We expect that the amounts accrued for facilities costs will be paid in 2019.\nIncome Taxes. We recorded an income tax provision of approximately $3 million in 2018 and a benefit for income taxes of approximately $18 million in 2017. The provision recorded in 2018 was primarily the result of foreign operations. The benefit recorded in 2017 was primarily the result of the release of an approximately $16 million domestic valuation allowance as a result of net deferred tax liabilities acquired as part of the GENBAND acquisition.\nThe Edgewater Acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination and the financial results of Edgewater have been included in our consolidated financial statements for the period subsequent to the Edgewater Acquisition Date.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) Section A - Leases: Amendments to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASU 2016-02\"), its new standard on accounting for leases. ASU 2016-02 introduces a lessee model that brings most leases onto the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 eliminates the current GAAP requirement for an entity to use bright-line tests in determining lease classification. ASU 2016-02 became effective for us for both interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2019. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, we will recognize lease obligations for the right to use these assets in connection with our existing lease agreements. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements (\"ASU 2018-11\") and ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases, both of which provided improvements to certain aspects of the guidance in ASC 842, Leases. In January 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-01, Leases (Topic 842): Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842, which provided additional clarification and implementation guidance. We have elected to use the alternative transition method as described in ASU 2018-11, which allows entities to initially apply ASU 2016-02 at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings, with no subsequent adjustments to prior period lease costs for comparability. To illustrate the magnitude of this change, the amount of our off-balance sheet operating leases at December 31, 2018 is disclosed in Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements. Beginning on January 1, 2019, our operating leases, excluding those with terms less than 12 months, were discounted and recorded as assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.\nWe believe that our total gross margin will increase in 2019, primarily due to the expected higher software content as a percentage of our total revenue, coupled with the impact of our restructuring and integration cost reduction initiatives.\nWe write down our evaluation equipment at the time of shipment to our customers, as it is not probable that the inventory value will be realizable.\nGENBAND\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (\"ASU 2016-13\"), which adds an impairment model that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under ASU 2016-13, an entity recognizes as an allowance its estimate of expected credit losses, which the FASB believes will result in more timely recognition of such losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2020 for both interim and annual reporting periods, with early adoption permitted.\nThe increase in 2018 general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to approximately $11 million of higher professional fees (i.e., legal, audit and outside services), approximately $4 million of higher employee-related expenses, approximately $2 million of higher infrastructure-related expenses and approximately $1 million of net increases in other general and administrative expenses. The increase in our professional fees included approximately $8 million of fees related to ongoing litigation with one of our competitors and approximately $1 million of fees related to our planned convertible senior notes offering that we subsequently elected not to proceed with, as we believed that then-current market conditions were not conducive for an offering on terms that would be in the best interests of our stockholders. The increase in our employee-related expenses was primarily attributable to approximately $9 million of higher salary and related expenses, including expense in connection with our company-wide cash bonus program, partially offset by approximately $6 million of lower stock-based compensation expense. These increases were primarily attributable to the inclusion of GENBAND general and administrative expenses for the full year in 2018 compared to the inclusion of two months of GENBAND general and administrative expenses in 2017, partially offset by the cost reductions realized from our recent restructuring initiatives. Our general and administrative expenses in 2018 also included approximately $1 million of expense attributable to Edgewater, primarily for professional fees and employee- and infrastructure-related expenses.\nTaqua, LLC\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (\"ASU 2016-15\"), which adds or clarifies guidance on eight cash flow issues, including debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or certain other debt instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, distributions received from equity method investees, beneficial interests in securitization transactions and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. ASU 2016-15 became effective for us beginning January 1, 2018 for both interim and annual reporting periods.\nSee \"Results of Operations\" in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") for additional discussion of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nOverall, we expect that total revenue in 2019 will increase compared with our 2018 total revenue, primarily due to the inclusion of revenue attributable to our acquisition of Edgewater.\nWe grant performance-based stock units, some of which include a market condition, to certain of our executives. We use a Monte Carlo simulation approach to model future stock price movements based upon the risk-free rate of return, the volatility of each entity, and the pair-wise covariance between each entity. These results are then used to calculate the grant date fair values of the performance-based stock units.\n\nOur investing activities used approximately $35 million of cash in 2018, provided approximately $21 million of cash in 2017 and used approximately $27 million of cash in 2016. In 2018, we used approximately $46 million to pay the cash consideration for the Edgewater Acquisition and approximately $8 million to purchase property and equipment, partially offset by approximately $19 million of sales and maturities of our investments in marketable securities. In 2017, net sales of our investments in marketable securities provided approximately $67 million of cash, of which we used approximately $43 million to pay the cash consideration for GENBAND. We used approximately $4 million to purchase property and equipment. In 2016, we used approximately $21 million of cash, net of cash acquired, for business acquisitions, approximately $5 million of cash for the purchase of property and equipment, and approximately $3 million for net investments in marketable securities. The amount used for business acquisitions was comprised of $20 million, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition of Taqua, and slightly under $1 million paid as the final consideration installment for a previous acquisition.\nIn connection with the Merger, we implemented a restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of 2017 to eliminate certain redundant positions and facilities within the combined companies (the \"Merger Restructuring Initiative\"). We recorded approximately $16 million of restructuring expense related to the Merger Restructuring Initiative in 2018, comprised of approximately $15 million for severance and related expenses and approximately $1 million in connection with redundant facilities located in the Czech Republic, Canada and the U.S. We recorded approximately $9 million of restructuring expense for severance and related expenses in 2017 related to the Merger Restructuring Initiative. We anticipate that we will record additional future expense in connection with this initiative for headcount and redundant facilities aggregating approximately $5 million. We believe that the severance payments currently accrued will be completed in 2019 and that the payments related to redundant facilities will be completed in 2029, when the last of the leases for these restructured facilities expires. We are actively seeking to sublease each of these facilities.\n \ntypical contract includes both product and services. Generally, contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. SSPs are typically estimated based on observable transactions when these services are sold on a standalone basis.\nManagement's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from management's estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. The significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical include revenue recognition, the valuation of inventory, loss contingencies and reserves, stock-based compensation, business combinations, goodwill and intangible assets, and accounting for income taxes.\nIn 2017, approximately 24% of our product revenue was from indirect sales through our channel partner program, compared to approximately 26% in 2016.\n\nCash provided by operating activities in 2017 was primarily the result of higher deferred revenue and accounts payable, coupled with decreases in inventory and other operating assets. These were partially offset by higher accounts receivable and lower accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities, plus the impact of our net loss, adjusted for non-cash items. The increase in accounts payable relates to the timing of purchases of both services and tangible goods and their related payment arrangements. The increase in accounts receivable primarily relates to higher revenue in 2017 compared to 2016, partially offset by our continued focus on our collection efforts. Our net loss, adjusted for non-cash items such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, impairment of intangible assets and deferred income taxes, was virtually break-even.\nWe provide for income taxes during interim periods based on the estimated effective tax rate for the full year. We record a cumulative adjustment to the tax provision in an interim period in which a change in the estimated annual effective tax rate is determined.\nOur maintenance revenue increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the inclusion of approximately $21 million of revenue attributable to GENBAND in 2017 for the period following the Merger Date and the inclusion of approximately $5 million of revenue attributable to Taqua.\nOverview\nWe expect that our product revenue in 2019 will increase compared with 2018 levels, primarily due to the inclusion of revenue attributable to our acquisition of Edgewater.\n\nOur maintenance revenue increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the inclusion of GENBAND maintenance revenue for the full year in 2018 compared to the inclusion of two months of GENBAND maintenance revenue in 2017.\n\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2014-09, its new standard on revenue from contracts with customers, along with additional ASUs which, among other things, clarified the implementation of the new revenue guidance and delayed the adoption by one year, to January 1, 2018 (the \"New Revenue Standard\"). The New Revenue Standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The core principle of the revenue model is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In applying the revenue model to contracts within its scope, an entity identifies the contract(s) with a customer, identifies the performance obligations in the contract, determines the transaction price, allocates the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and recognizes revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the New Revenue Standard using the modified retrospective option and have identified the necessary changes to our policies, processes, systems and controls. Under the modified retrospective method, we are applying the New Revenue Standard to all contracts not yet completed as of January 1, 2018, recognizing in beginning Accumulated deficit an adjustment for the cumulative effect of the change and providing additional disclosures comparing results to those as if we were still following the previous accounting standards. Under ASC 605, we concluded we did not have VSOE for certain elements in software bundled arrangements, which resulted in revenue being recognized ratably over the longest performance period. The majority of the transition adjustments related to these arrangements. In connection with the adoption of ASC 606, as of January 1, 2018, the Company recorded an adjustment to decrease Accumulated deficit by approximately $12 million and capitalized certain commission costs resulting directly from securing contracts which were previously expensed.\nRevenue earned from customers domiciled outside the United States was approximately 34% of total revenue in 2017 and approximately 31% of revenue in 2016.\nAnova Data, Inc.\nAs consideration for the Edgewater Acquisition, we paid, in the aggregate, approximately $46 million of cash, net of cash acquired, and issued 4.2 million shares of Ribbon common stock to Edgewater's selling shareholders and holders of vested in-the-money options and warrants to acquire common stock of Edgewater (the \"Edgewater Selling Stakeholders\") on the Edgewater Acquisition Date. The cash payment was funded through our existing credit facility. We had previously agreed to pay the Edgewater Selling Stakeholders an additional $30 million of cash, $15 million of which was to be paid six months from the Edgewater Acquisition Date and the other $15 million of which was to be paid as early as nine months from the Edgewater Acquisition Date and no later than 18 months from the Edgewater Acquisition Date (the exact timing of which would depend on the amount of revenue generated from the sales of Edgewater products in 2018) (the \"Edgewater Deferred Consideration\"). On February 15, 2019, we and the Edgewater Selling Stakeholders agreed to reduce the amount of Edgewater Deferred Consideration from $30 million to $21.9 million and agreed that all such deferred consideration will be payable on March 8, 2019.\nInterest Income, net. Interest income and interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (in millions, except percentages):\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, NewCo issued 50.9 million shares to the GENBAND equity holders, with the number of shares issued in the aggregate to the GENBAND equity holders equal to the number of shares of Sonus common stock\n\nThe increase in our professional services revenue in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the inclusion of GENBAND professional services revenue for the full year in 2018 compared to the inclusion of two months of GENBAND professional services revenue in 2017.\nWe assess all material positions taken in any income tax return, including all significant uncertain positions, in all tax years that are still subject to assessment or challenge by relevant taxing authorities. Assessing an uncertain tax position begins with the initial determination of the position's sustainability and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. As of each balance sheet date, unresolved uncertain tax positions must be reassessed, and we will determine whether (i) the factors underlying the sustainability assertion have changed and (ii) the amount of recognized tax benefit is still appropriate. The recognition and measurement of tax benefits require significant judgment. Judgments concerning the recognition and measurement of a tax benefit might change as new information becomes available.\nRestructuring Expense. We recorded net restructuring expense of approximately $9 million in 2017, comprised of approximately $9 million in connection with our Merger Restructuring Initiative, less than $1 million in connection with our Taqua Restructuring Initiative and less than $1 million in connection with our 2016 Restructuring Initiative, net of reversals for changes in estimated costs totaling less than $1 million in the aggregate in connection with the GENBAND Restructuring Initiative, the Taqua Restructuring Initiative and the 2016 Restructuring Initiative. We recorded restructuring expense aggregating approximately $3 million in 2016, primarily for severance and related costs, comprised of approximately $2 million under our 2016 Restructuring Initiative and approximately $1 million related to our Taqua Restructuring Initiative.\nsavings from our ongoing restructuring and integration cost savings initiatives.\nIn June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting (\"ASU 2018-07\"), which expands the scope of ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation (\"ASC 718\"), to include all share-based payment arrangements related to the acquisition of goods and services from both nonemployees and employees. As a result, most of the guidance in ASC 718 associated with employee share-based payments, including most of its requirements related to classification and measurement, applies to nonemployee share-based payment arrangements. ASU 2018-07 became effective for us beginning January 1, 2019.\nCash provided by operating activities in 2016 was primarily the result of decreases in inventory and other operating assets and higher deferred revenue, partially offset by lower accrued expenses and accounts payable, higher accounts receivable and our net loss. The decrease in accrued expenses primarily relates to lower accruals in connection with our Company-wide cash bonus program, for which we changed the timing of bonus payments in 2016 such that a portion of the bonus was paid in August 2016 based on our results against certain internal goals for the first half of the year. Bonuses for the remainder of 2016 were paid in early 2017 based on our results for the second half of 2016. The increase in accounts receivable primarily relates to higher revenue in 2016 compared to 2015, partially offset by the results of our continued focus on our collection efforts. Our net loss, adjusted for non-cash items such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and deferred income taxes, provided approximately $21 million of cash.\nWe use the Black-Scholes valuation model for estimating the fair value on the date of grant of employee stock options. Determining the fair value of stock option awards at the grant date requires judgment regarding certain valuation assumptions, including the volatility of our stock price, expected term of the option, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. Changes in such assumptions and estimates could result in different fair values and could therefore impact our earnings. Such changes, however, would not impact our cash flows. The fair value of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance-based awards is based upon our stock price on the grant date.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe decrease in service gross margin in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the inclusion of GENBAND service costs for the full year in 2018 compared to the inclusion of two months of GENBAND service costs in 2017, coupled with higher project-related service costs, each of which decreased our service gross margin by approximately two percentage points. Although service revenue increased by approximately $150 million in 2018 compared to 2017, the increase in service costs of approximately $69 million contributed to the decline in gross margin. Our service cost of revenue is relatively fixed in advance of any particular quarter and therefore, changes in service revenue will typically have a significant impact on service gross margins.\nThe increase in sales and marketing expenses in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to approximately $32 million of higher employee-related expenses, approximately $6 million of higher amortization of acquired intangible assets and approximately $6 million of higher infrastructure-related expenses. The increase in employee-related expenses was primarily attributable to $28 million of higher salary and commissions and related expenses, including our company-wide cash bonus program, and approximately $6 million of higher employee travel and training and related expenses, partially offset by approximately $2 million of lower stock-based compensation expense. These increases were primarily attributable to the inclusion of GENBAND sales and marketing expenses for the full year in 2018 compared to the inclusion of two months of GENBAND sales and marketing expenses in 2017, partially offset by the cost reductions realized from our recent restructuring initiatives. Our sales and marketing expenses in 2018 also included approximately $5 million of expense attributable to Edgewater for the period since the Edgewater Acquisition Date, primarily for employee- and infrastructure-related expenses.\nOn the Merger Date and in connection with the Merger, we assumed GENBAND's Senior Secured Credit Agreement (the \"Prior Credit Agreement\") with Silicon Valley Bank (\"SVB\"), which had outstanding borrowings and letters of credit totaling approximately $18 million and $3 million, respectively, and an average interest rate of 4.67%. GENBAND had entered into the Prior Credit Agreement with SVB effective July 1, 2016. The Prior Credit Agreement had a maturity date of July 1, 2019 and provided for revolving loans, including letters of credit and swingline loans, not to exceed $50 million in total, with potential further increases of up to $75 million available for a total revolving line of credit of up to $125 million. The Prior Credit Agreement was superseded by a Senior Secured Credit Agreement, as amended, which was entered into on December 21, 2017 and is discussed below.\nValuation of Inventory. We review inventory for both potential obsolescence and potential loss of value periodically. In this review, we make assumptions about the future demand for and market value of the inventory and, based on these assumptions, estimate the amount of any excess, obsolete or slow-moving inventory.\noperations, we may need to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing. We may not be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all.\nIf any default exists under the Credit Facility, or if the Borrower is unable to make any of the representations and warranties as stated in the Credit Agreement at the applicable time, the Borrower will be unable to borrow funds or have letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility, which, depending on the circumstances prevailing at that time, could have a material adverse effect on the Borrower's liquidity and working capital.\nWe assumed GENBAND's restructuring liability aggregating approximately $4 million at the Merger Date (the \"GENBAND Restructuring Initiative\"), primarily related to headcount reductions. In 2018, we recorded approximately $1 million of restructuring expense for changes in estimated costs for previously recorded initiatives, primarily changes in negotiated severance to employees in certain international locations and changes in estimated sublease income for restructured facilities. We do not expect to record additional expense in connection with this initiative except for adjustments for changes in estimated costs. We believe that the payments will be completed in 2020, when the lease for this restructured facility expires.\nIn 2017, approximately 20% of our product revenue was attributable to sales to enterprise customers, compared to approximately 19% in 2016. These sales were made through both our direct sales team and indirect sales channel partners.\nIn connection with the purchase price allocation to record our acquisition of GENBAND, we were required to record at fair value the assumed deferred revenue, resulting in a reduction of approximately $50 million to the assumed deferred revenue and future recognizable revenue. We recognized approximately $22 million less revenue in 2018 and expect to recognize approximately $7 million less revenue in 2019 than GENBAND would have recognized in the same period had we not acquired it. Our purchase price allocation to record our acquisition of Edgewater resulted in a reduction of approximately $4 million to the assumed deferred revenue and future recognizable revenue. We recognized approximately $2 million less revenue in the period of 2018 following the Edgewater Acquisition Date than Edgewater would have recognized in the same period had we not acquired it. We expect that these purchase accounting-related reductions to future revenue will continue through 2020, primarily related to future maintenance revenue.\nOur annual testing for impairment of goodwill is completed as of November 30. We operate as a single operating segment with one reporting unit and consequently we evaluate goodwill for impairment based on an evaluation of the fair value of the Company as a whole. We performed our step one assessments for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 and determined each year that our fair value was in excess of our carrying value and accordingly, there was no impairment of goodwill. At certain times during 2018, including at our annual testing date of November 30, 2018, our market capitalization was below our book value. While we have concluded that the fair value exceeds carrying value at that date, we regularly monitor for changes in circumstances, including changes to our projections regarding performance of the business, that could result in impairment of goodwill.\nThe increase in research and development expenses in 2017 compared to 2016 was attributable to approximately $19 million of higher employee-related expenses, approximately $7 million of higher product development expense, approximately $2 million of higher infrastructure-related expense and approximately $1 million of net increases in other research and development costs. The increase in employee-related expenses was attributable to approximately $14 million of higher salary and related expenses, approximately $2 million of higher stock-based compensation expense and approximately $3 million of higher combined expense in connection with our company-wide bonus program and employee travel, training and related expenses. Our 2017 research and development expenses included approximately $17 million of expense attributable to GENBAND, primarily comprised of approximately $9 million of employee-related expenses, approximately $5 million of product development costs, approximately $1 million of depreciation expense and approximately $1 million of infrastructure expense.\nOn August 3, 2018 (the \"Edgewater Acquisition Date\"), we completed our acquisition of Edgewater Networks, Inc. (\"Edgewater\"), a private company headquartered in San Jose, California (the \"Edgewater Acquisition\"). Edgewater is a market leader in Network Edge Orchestration for the small and medium enterprise and UC market. We believe that the acquisition of Edgewater will allow us to offer our global customer base a complete core-to-edge product portfolio, end-to-end service assurance and analytics solutions, and a fully integrated SD-WAN service.\nAcquisition- and Integration-Related Expenses. Acquisition- and integration-related expenses include those expenses related to acquisitions that we would otherwise not have incurred. Acquisition-related expenses include professional and services fees, such as legal, audit, consulting, paying agent and other fees, and expenses related to cash payments to certain former executives of the acquired businesses in connection with their employment agreements. Integration-related expenses represent incremental costs related to combining the Company's systems and processes with those of acquired businesses,\nOur deferred product revenue was approximately $22 million at December 31, 2017 and approximately $7 million at December 31, 2016. Our deferred service revenue was approximately $93 million at December 31, 2017 and approximately $44 million at December 31, 2016.\n\nAcquisition- and Integration-Related Expenses. We recorded approximately $15 million of acquisition- and integration-related expenses in the year ended December 31, 2017, comprised of approximately $13 million of acquisition-related expense and approximately $2 million of integration-related expense. The acquisition-related expense was comprised of approximately $12 million for professional services fees and $1 million related to cash payments to certain former GENBAND executives. We recorded approximately $1 million of acquisition-related expenses in 2016 in connection with the acquisition of Taqua.\nWe write down our inventories if they are considered to be obsolete or at levels in excess of forecasted demand. In these cases, inventory is written down to estimated realizable value based on historical usage and expected demand. Inherent in our estimates of market value in determining inventory valuation are estimates related to economic trends, future demand for our products and technical obsolescence of our products. If future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our\nAt December 31, 2018, we had valuation allowances of approximately $82 million to offset net domestic deferred tax assets of approximately $83 million. In addition, we had valuation allowances to offset Canada federal credits carryovers of approximately $10 million and Ireland net deferred tax assets of $10 million. In the event we determine it is more likely than not that we will be able to use a deferred tax asset in the future in excess of its net carrying value, the valuation allowance would be reduced, thereby increasing net earnings and increasing equity in the period such determination is made. We have recorded net deferred tax assets in some of our international subsidiaries. These amounts could change in future periods based upon our operating results and changes in tax law.\nOur financing activities provided approximately $32 million of cash in 2018 and used approximately $4 million of cash in 2017 and $10 million in 2016. The 2018 amount was primarily comprised of approximately $35 million of net borrowings against our Credit Facility, partially offset by approximately $2 million used to pay withholding obligations related to the net share settlement of restricted and performance-based stock grants upon vesting and approximately $1 million in the aggregate used to make principal payments on our capital lease obligations and debt issuance costs related to our Credit Facility. The 2017 amount was primarily comprised of approximately $8 million used to pay withholding obligations related to the net share settlement of restricted and performance-based stock grants upon vesting and $1 million to pay debt issuance costs related to our Credit Facility, partially offset by approximately $2 million of net borrowings against our Credit Facility, $1 million of proceeds from the sale of our common stock in connection with our Amended and Restated 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended, and approximately $1 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options. The 2016 amount was primarily comprised of approximately $10 million used for the repurchase of common stock under our stock buyback program.\nWe recorded restructuring expense of approximately $17 million in 2018, comprised of approximately $16 million in connection with our Merger Restructuring Initiative and approximately $1 million for changes in estimated costs in connection with our assumption of GENBAND's restructuring liability at the time of Merger.\n__________________________________\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting (\"ASU 2017-09\"), which amends the scope of modification accounting for share-based payment arrangements such that an entity would not apply modification accounting if the fair value, vesting conditions and classification of the awards are the same immediately before and after the modification. ASU 2017-09 became effective for us beginning January 1, 2018 for both interim and annual reporting periods. The adoption of ASU 2017-09 did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.\nOther Income, Net. Other income, net, in 2017 of approximately $1 million was primarily comprised of the gain on the sale of an intangible asset and foreign currency gains. Other income, net, in 2016 of approximately $1 million was primarily comprised of gains from the sale of intangible assets.\n\nThe following customers each contributed 10% or more of our revenue in at least one of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nBusiness Acquisitions\nOn December 21, 2017, we entered into a Senior Secured Credit Agreement (as amended, the Credit Facility\u201d) with SVB, which refinanced the Prior Credit Agreement. The Credit Facility includes $100 million of commitments, the full amount of which is available for revolving loans, a $15 million sublimit that is available for letters of credit and a $15 million sublimit that is available for swingline loans. The Credit Facility is scheduled to mature in December 2021, subject to a springing maturity if, on or before July 14, 2020, the existing promissory note issued to certain shareholders is not converted or extended to March 2022 or later. The Credit Facility contains procedures for additional financial institutions to become lenders, or for any existing lender to increase its commitment under the facility, subject to an available increase of $50 million for all incremental commitments under the Credit Facility without amendment. On June 24, 2018, we amended the Credit Facility to, among other things, permit the Edgewater Acquisition and related transactions.\nResults of Operations\nAcquisition- and integration-related expenses are reported separately in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (\"ASU 2018-02\"), which amends ASC 220, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income, to allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive\noutstanding immediately prior to the closing date of the Merger, such that former stockholders of Sonus would own approximately 50%, and former shareholders of GENBAND and the two related holding companies would own approximately 50%, of the shares of NewCo common stock issued and outstanding immediately following the consummation of the Merger.\nThe timing of the completion of customer projects and revenue recognition criteria satisfaction may cause our product revenue to fluctuate from one period to the next.\n\nOn December 21, 2017, concurrently with the completion of the Credit Facility, we repaid in full all outstanding amounts under the Prior Credit Agreement and terminated the agreement. We did not incur any early termination penalties in connection with the termination of the Prior Credit Agreement.\n \nOur product revenue is generated from sales of software with attached appliances, software licenses and software subscription fees. Certain of our products may be included in more than one of our solutions (session solutions, network transformation solutions, and applications and security solutions), dependent upon the configuration of the individual customer solutions sold. Our software with attached appliances and software license revenues are primarily comprised of our media gateway, call controller, signaling, virtual mobile core and management (i.e., analytics, assurance, billing, etc.) products. Our software subscription fees revenue is primarily comprised of sales of our UC-related (i.e., application server, media server, etc.), Kandy Cloud and Ribbon Protect products. All three of our solutions portfolios address both the service provider and enterprise markets and are sold through both our direct sales program and from indirect sales through our channel partner program.\nOur 2018 operating expenses included approximately $17 million of acquisition- and integration-related expenses, primarily related to the Merger and, to a lesser extent, to the recent acquisition of Edgewater, and approximately $17 million of restructuring expense, primarily related to severance and related costs.\nService revenue includes revenue from customer support and other professional services. We offer warranties on our products. Certain of our warranties are considered to be assurance-type in nature and do not cover anything beyond ensuring that the product is functioning as intended. Based on the guidance in ASC 606, assurance-type warranties do not represent separate performance obligations. We also sell separately-priced maintenance service contracts which qualify as service-type warranties and represent separate performance obligations. We do not allow and have no history of accepting product returns.\nOur revenue was approximately $578 million in 2018, $330 million in 2017 and $253 million in 2016. Our gross profit was approximately $308 million in 2018, $201 million in 2017 and $168 million in 2016. Our gross profit as a percentage of revenue (\"total gross margin\") was approximately 53% in 2018, 61% in 2017 and 66% in 2016.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract ( ASU 2018-15\u201d), which provides guidance on implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement ( CCA\u201d) that is a service contract. ASU 2018-15 amends ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other ( ASC 350\u201d) to include in its scope implementation costs of a CCA that is a service contract and clarifies that a customer should apply the guidance in ASC 350-40 to determine which implementation costs should be capitalized in such a CCA. ASU 2018-15 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2020. We are currently assessing the potential impact of the adoption of ASU 2018-15 on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe have provided for income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 31, 2018, with the exception of the Company's Irish subsidiary, as we do not plan to permanently reinvest these amounts outside the U.S. The repatriation of the undistributed earnings would result in withholding taxes imposed on the repatriation. Consequently, we have recorded a tax liability of $4.5 million, consisting of potential withholding and distribution taxes related to undistributed earnings from these subsidiaries as of December 31, 2018. Had the earnings of the Irish subsidiary been determined to not be permanently reinvested outside the U.S., no additional deferred tax liability would be required due to no withholding taxes or income tax expense being imposed on such repatriation.\nWe are charged a commitment fee ranging from 0.25% to 0.40% per year on the daily amount of the unused portions of the commitments under the Credit Facility. Additionally, with respect to all letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility, we are charged a fronting fee of 0.125% per year and an outstanding letter of credit fee equal to the Applicable Margin for base rate loans ranging from 1.50% to 2.00% times the amount of the outstanding letters of credit.\nContractual Obligations\nBusiness Combinations. We allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed and represents the expected future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in the business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. Significant management judgments and assumptions are required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, particularly acquired intangible assets which are principally based upon estimates of the future performance and cash flows expected from the acquired business and applied discount rates. While we use our best estimates and assumptions as part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at a business combination date, our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. If different assumptions are used, it could materially impact the purchase price allocation and our financial position and results of operations. Any adjustments to assets acquired or liabilities assumed subsequent to the purchase price allocation period are included in operating results in the period in which the adjustments are determined. Intangible assets typically are comprised of in-process research and development, developed technology, customer relationships, trade names and internal use software.\n\nThe decrease in product gross margin in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the inclusion of GENBAND product costs for the full year in 2018 compared to the inclusion of two months of GENBAND product costs in 2017, including the amortization of intangible assets arising from the Merger, which decreased our product gross margin by approximately six percentage points, coupled with product and customer mix, which also decreased our product gross margin by approximately six percentage points.\n\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial position, changes in financial position, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nFinancial Overview\nRevenue earned from customers domiciled outside the United States was approximately 42% of revenue in 2018 and approximately 34% of revenue in 2017. Due to the timing of project completions, we expect that the domestic and international components as a percentage of our revenue may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year.\nAlthough we have eliminated positions as part of our restructuring initiatives, we continue to hire in certain areas that we believe are important to our future growth. Restructuring expense is reported separately in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOur purchases of materials and components for manufacture increased in 2018 compared with 2017 due to the inclusion of GENBAND's operations since October 27, 2017 in our consolidated results. We expect our future purchases of materials and components to decrease as a result of the increase in software content of our products both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our revenue.\nIn March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Post Retirement Benefit Cost (\"ASU 2017-07\"). ASU 2017-07 amends the requirements in ASC 715, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (\"ASC 715\") to require entities to disaggregate the current-service-cost component from the other components of net benefit cost (the \"other components\") and include it with other current compensation costs for related employees, present the other components elsewhere in the income statement and outside of income from operations if such a subtotal is presented and disclose the income statement lines that contain the other components if they are not presented on appropriately described separate lines. ASU 2017-07 became effective for us beginning January 1, 2018 for both interim and annual reporting periods. The adoption of ASU 2017-07 did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.\nincome to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Act and requires entities to provide certain disclosures regarding stranded tax effects. ASU 2018-02 became effective for us beginning January 1, 2019.\nLoss Contingencies and Reserves. We are subject to ongoing business risks arising in the ordinary course of business that affect the estimation process of the carrying value of assets, the recording of liabilities and the possibility of various loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to determine whether such amounts should be adjusted and record changes in estimates in the period they become known. We are subject to various legal claims. We reserve for legal contingencies and legal fees when the amounts are probable and reasonably estimable.\nThe Merger has been accounted for as a business combination and the financial results of GENBAND have been included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on the Merger Date. On November 28, 2017, the Company changed its name to \"Ribbon Communications Inc.\"\nThe software licenses typically provide a perpetual right to use our software. We also sell term-based software licenses that expire and Software-as-as-Service (\"SaaS\")-based software which are referred to as subscription arrangements. We do not customize our software nor are installation services required, as the customer has a right to utilize internal resources or a third-party service company. The software and appliances are delivered before related services are provided and are functional without professional services or customer support. We have concluded that our software licenses are functional intellectual property that are distinct, as the user can benefit from the software on its own. The product revenue is typically recognized upon transfer of control or when the software is made available for download, as this is the point that the user of the software can direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the functional intellectual property. We do not recognize software revenue related to the renewal of subscription software licenses earlier than the beginning of the subscription period. Appliance products are generally sold with software to provide the customer solution.\nThe indebtedness and other obligations under the Credit Facility are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by us and each of our other material U.S. domestic subsidiaries (collectively, the \"Guarantors\"). The Credit Agreement is secured by first-priority liens on substantially all of our assets.\n\nOn July 25, 2016, we announced a program (the \"2016 Restructuring Initiative\") to further accelerate our investment in new technologies as the communications industry migrates to a cloud-based architecture and pursues new strategic initiatives, such as new products and an expanded go-to-market footprint in selected geographies and discrete vertical markets. We have recorded an aggregate of approximately $2 million of restructuring expense in connection with this initiative, primarily for severance and related costs. The amounts accrued for severance and related costs were fully paid in 2017. We expect that the amounts accrued for facilities will be paid by the end of 2019.\n\nInterest expense in both 2018 and 2017 was primarily comprised of interest on the related party promissory note issued in connection with the Merger, the outstanding revolving credit facility balance, the amortization of debt issuance costs in connection with our revolving credit facilities and interest on capital lease obligations. Interest income consisted of interest earned on our cash equivalents, marketable securities and investments. The higher interest expense in 2018 compared with 2017 was primarily due to the promissory note and credit facility balances outstanding for the full year 2018, compared to approximately two months in 2017. The decrease in interest income in 2018 compared with 2017 was primarily due to the lower amounts available for investment in 2018.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had an outstanding debt balance of $55 million at a weighted average interest rate of 5.96% and approximately $3 million of outstanding letters of credit at an interest rate of 1.75% under the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2017, we had an outstanding debt balance of $20 million at an interest rate of 4.51% and approximately $3 million of outstanding letters of credit at an interest rate of 2.00% under the Credit Facility.\nService revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was comprised of the following (in millions, except percentages): \nThe following customer contributed 10% or more of our revenue in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nWe offer customer training courses, for which the related revenue is typically recognized as the training services are performed.\nYears Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nInterest income consisted of interest earned on our cash equivalents, marketable securities and investments. Interest expense in 2017 was primarily comprised of interest on the outstanding revolving credit facility balance assumed in connection with the acquisition of GENBAND, amortization of debt issuance costs in connection with our revolving credit facilities and interest on capital lease obligations. Interest expense in 2016 was comprised of expense related to the amortization of debt issuance costs in connection with our revolving credit facility and expense related to interest on capital lease obligations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nCost of Revenue/Gross Margin. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of amounts paid to third-party manufacturers for purchased materials and services, royalties and manufacturing and services personnel and related costs. Our cost of revenue and gross margins for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in millions, except percentages):\nEdgewater Networks, Inc.\nIncome Taxes. We recorded a benefit for income taxes of approximately $18 million in 2017 and a provision for income taxes of approximately $3 million in 2016. The benefit recorded in 2017 was primarily the result of the release of an approximately $16 million domestic valuation allowance as a result of net deferred tax liabilities acquired as part of the GENBAND acquisition. The expense recorded in 2016 was primarily related to foreign operations. During 2017 and 2016,\nOur product revenue increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the inclusion of GENBAND's product revenue for the full year in 2018 compared to the inclusion of two months of GENBAND's product revenue in 2017. Product revenue from sales of our software with attached appliances and software licenses contributed approximately $85 million in the aggregate to the increase in our product revenue in 2018, coupled with approximately $13 million of higher 2018 product revenue from sales of our software subscriptions.\nThe amount of stock-based compensation expense recorded in any period for unvested awards requires estimates of the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited prior to vesting, as well as assumptions regarding the probability that performance-based stock awards without market conditions will be earned.\nOn September 26, 2016 (the \"Taqua Acquisition Date\"), we acquired Taqua, LLC (\"Taqua\"), a leading supplier of IP communications systems, applications and services to mobile and fixed operators. Taqua enables the transformation of software-based service provider networks to deliver next-generation voice, video and messaging services, including VoIP, VoWiFi and VoLTE. The financial results of Taqua are included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on the Taqua Acquisition Date.\nIn connection with the Merger, on October 27, 2017, we issued a promissory note for approximately $23 million to certain of GENBAND's equity holders (the \"Promissory Note\"). The Promissory Note does not amortize and the principal thereon is payable in full on the third anniversary of its execution. Interest on the promissory note is payable quarterly in arrears and accrued at a rate of 7.5% per year for the first six months after issuance, and thereafter at a rate of 10% per year. The failure to make any payment under the Promissory Note when due and, with respect to payment of any interest, the continuation of such failure for a period of thirty days thereafter, constitutes an event of default under the Promissory Note. If an event of default occurs under the Promissory Note, the payees may declare the entire balance of the Promissory Note due and payable (including principal and accrued and unpaid interest) within five business days of the payees' notification to the Company of such acceleration. Interest that is not paid on the interest payment date will increase the principal amount of the Promissory Note. At December 31, 2018, the Promissory Note balance was $24.1 million, comprised of $22.5 million of principal plus $1.6 million of interest converted to principal.\nOther (Expense) Income, Net. Other expense, net, in 2018 of approximately $4 million was primarily comprised of foreign currency losses. Other income, net, in 2017 of approximately $1 million was primarily comprised of the gain on the sale of an intangible asset and foreign currency gains.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. Intangible assets with estimated lives and other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of intangible assets with estimated lives and other long-lived assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to future net undiscounted pretax cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If these comparisons indicate that an asset is not recoverable, we will recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the related estimated fair value.\nAs a result of the Merger, we believe we are better positioned to enable network transformations to IP and to cloud-based networks for service providers and enterprise customers worldwide, with a broader and deeper sales footprint, increased ability to invest in growth, more efficient and effective research and development, and a comprehensive RTC product offering.\nWe expect that our service revenue in 2019 will increase compared with 2018 levels, primarily due to the inclusion of revenue attributable to our acquisition of Edgewater and the continued organic growth of our installed customer base. However, we expect to continue to encounter ongoing industry pricing pressure, third-party competition and legacy network product decommissioning.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (in millions, except percentages):\nOur cash, cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments totaled approximately $51 million at December 31, 2018 and $83 million at December 31, 2017. We had cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries aggregating approximately $11 million at December 31, 2018 and $14 million at December 31, 2017. If we elect to repatriate all of the funds held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 31, 2018, we do not believe that the amounts of potential withholding taxes that would arise from the repatriation would have a material effect on our liquidity.\nOn February 28, 2019, we acquired the business and technology assets of Anova Data, Inc. (\"Anova\"), a provider of advanced analytics solutions, for total purchase consideration of 3.3 million shares of our common stock. Anova is based in the U.S., and its NextGen products provide a cloud-native, streaming analytics platform for network and subscriber optimization and monetization. We believe that the proposed acquisition reinforces and extends our strategy to expand into network optimization, security and data monetization via big data analytics and machine learning. We do not expect that the acquisition will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in 2019.\nRevenue. Revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was as follows (in millions, except percentages):\nWe derive revenue from two primary sources: products (software and non-software products) and services. Software and non-software product revenue is generated from sales of our software with proprietary appliances that function together to deliver the products' essential functionality. Software and appliances are also sold on a standalone basis. Services include customer support (software updates and technical support), consulting, design services, installation services and training. A\nIn addition, the FASB has issued the following accounting pronouncements, none of which we believe will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements:\nWe recorded net restructuring expense of approximately $9 million in 2017, comprised of approximately $9 million in connection with our Merger Restructuring Initiative, less than $1 million in connection with our Taqua Restructuring Initiative and less than $1 million in connection with our 2016 Restructuring Initiative. The net restructuring expense recorded included reversals for changes in estimated costs totaling less than $1 million in the aggregate in connection with the GENBAND Restructuring Initiative, the Taqua Restructuring Initiative and the 2016 Restructuring Initiative.\nThe Credit Facility requires compliance with certain financial covenants, including a minimum consolidated quick ratio, minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and maximum consolidated leverage ratio, all of which are defined in the Credit Agreement and tested on a quarterly basis. In addition, the Credit Facility contains various covenants that, among other restrictions, limit our and our subsidiaries' ability to enter into certain types of transactions, including, but not limited to: incurring or assuming indebtedness, making acquisitions or engaging in mergers, making investments, repurchasing equity and paying dividends, selling or otherwise transferring assets, changing the nature of our business and amending or making prepayments on certain junior debt. We were in compliance with all covenants of the Credit Facility at December 31, 2018 and 2017.", "item_7_tables": "Table 186: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

report:\n\n- Ribbon Communications provides software solutions to telecom, wireless, cable and enterprise customers. Revenue was $578M in 2018, up from $330M in 2017 and $253M in 2016. \n\n- Net loss was $77M in 2018, $35M in 2017, and $14M in 2016. Loss widened in 2018 due to higher operating expenses.\n\n- In October 2017, Ribbon acquired GENBAND in an all-stock merger. This expanded product portfolio and customer base but also increased expenses. \n\n- In August 2018, Ribbon acquired Edgewater Networks for $46M to expand into network edge orchestration.\n\n- Gross margin declined from 61% in 2017 to 53% in 2018, driven by inclusion of lower margin GENBAND business. \n\n- Operating expenses were $374M in 2018, up from $257M in 2017, primarily due to GENBAND and other acquisitions.\n\n- R&D and sales/marketing are the two largest operating expense categories. Both increased in 2018 with the full year inclusion of GENBAND.\n\n- The company has undertaken restructuring initiatives to streamline operations, including headcount reductions. Recorded $17M restructuring expense in 2018.\n\n- Ribbon has a $100M senior secured credit facility maturing in 2021 to support operations and acquisitions. Had $55M drawn at December 31, 2018.\n\nIn summary, Ribbon is growing via acquisitions but this has increased expenses and reduced profitability. The company is restructuring to improve cost structure going forward."}
