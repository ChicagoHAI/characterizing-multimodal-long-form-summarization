Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements, the related notes and the section Important Notice to Investors Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d that appear elsewhere in this report.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe Company's discussion and analysis of its results of operations, financial condition and liquidity are based upon the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"). The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, shareholders' equity, sales and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an ongoing basis, the Company reviews its estimates to ensure that the estimates appropriately reflect changes in its business and new information as it becomes available.\nManagement believes the critical accounting policies discussed below affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. For a complete discussion of all of the Company's significant accounting policies, see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company accounts for revenue recognition in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 606, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\" See Note 2 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" and Note 4 Revenue Recognition\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nThe Company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products when it satisfies the terms of a sales order from a customer, and transfers control of the products ordered to the customer. Control transfers at a point in time when products are shipped, and in certain cases, when products are received by customers. In addition, the Company recognizes revenue at the point of sale on transactions with consumers at its retail locations. The Company receives a royalty from the licensing of its trademarks and service marks to third parties for certain apparel, gear and golf accessories. Royalty income is recognized over time in net sales as underlying product sales occur, subject to certain minimum royalties, in accordance with the related licensing arrangements and is included in the Company's Apparel, Gear and Other operating segment. Revenues from gift cards are deferred and recognized when the cards are redeemed. The Company's gift cards have no expiration date. The Company recognizes revenue from unredeemed gift cards, otherwise known as breakage, when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote and under circumstances that comply with any applicable state escheatment laws.\nThe amount of revenue the Company recognizes is based on the amount of consideration it expects to receive from customers. The amount of consideration is the sales price adjusted for estimates of variable consideration, including sales returns, discounts and allowances as well as sales programs, sales promotions and price concessions that are offered by the Company as described below. These estimates are based on the amounts earned or expected to be claimed by customers on the related sales, and are therefore recorded as reductions to sales and trade accounts receivable.\nThe Company's primary sales program, the Preferred Retailer Program,\u201d offers potential rebates and discounts for participating retailers in exchange for providing certain benefits to the Company, including the maintenance of agreed upon inventory levels, prime product placement and retailer staff training. Under this program, qualifying retailers can earn either discounts or rebates based upon the amount of product purchased. Discounts are applied and recorded at the time of sale. For rebates, the Company estimates the amount of variable consideration related to the rebate at the time of sale based on the customer's estimated qualifying current year product purchases. The estimate is based on the historical level of purchases, adjusted for any factors expected to affect the current year purchase levels. The estimated year-end rebate is adjusted quarterly based on actual purchase levels, as necessary. The Preferred Retailer Program is generally short-term in nature and the actual amount of rebate to be paid under this program is known as of the end of the year and paid to customers shortly after year-end. Historically, the Company's actual amount of variable consideration related to its Preferred Retailer Program has not been materially different from its estimates.\nThe Company also offers short-term sales program incentives, which include sell-through promotions and price concessions or price reductions. Sell-through promotions are generally offered throughout the product's life cycle, which varies from two to three years, and price concessions or price reductions are generally offered at the end of the product's life cycle. The estimated variable consideration related to these programs is based on a rate that includes historical and forecasted data. The Company records a reduction to net sales using this rate at the time of the sale. The Company monitors this rate against actual results and forecasted estimates and adjusts the rate as deemed necessary in order to reflect the amount of consideration it expects to receive from its customers. There were no material changes to the rate during the year ended December 31, 2020, and the Company's actual amount of variable consideration related to these sales programs has historically not been materially different from its estimates. However, if the actual variable consideration is significantly different than the accrued estimates, the Company may be exposed to adjustments to revenue that could be material. Assuming there had been a 10% increase over the accrued estimated variable consideration for 2020 sales program incentives, pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2020 would have decreased by approximately $2.5 million.\nThe Company records an estimate for anticipated returns as a reduction of sales and cost of sales, and accounts receivable in the period that the related sales are recorded. The cost recovery of inventory associated with this reserve is accounted for in other current assets. Sales returns are estimated based upon historical returns, current economic trends, changes in customer demands and sell-through of products. The Company also offers certain customers sales programs that allow for specific returns. The Company records a return reserve for anticipated returns related to these sales programs at the time of the sale based on the terms of the sales program. Historically, the Company's actual sales returns have not been materially different from management's original estimates. The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the allowance for sales returns. However, if the actual costs of sales returns are significantly different than the recorded estimated allowance, the Company may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. Assuming there had been a 10% increase over the recorded estimated allowance for 2020 sales returns less the cost recovery of inventory, pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2020 would have decreased by approximately $4.4 million.\nAllowance for Estimated Credit Losses\nThe Company maintains an allowance for estimated credit losses resulting from the failure of its customers to make required payments. As of January 1, 2020, the Company accounts for these estimated losses in accordance with ASC Topic 326, \"Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\" which replaced the \"expected credit loss\" model with the \"incurred loss\" model and requires consideration of a broader range of information to estimate expected credit losses over the life of the asset. The Company's prior methodology for estimating credit losses on trade accounts receivable did not differ significantly from the new requirements of ASC 326. Specific allowance amounts are established to record the appropriate provision for customers that have a higher probability of default. An estimate of credit losses for the remaining customers in the aggregate is based upon historical bad debts, current customer receivable balances, age of customer receivable balances, and the customers' financial condition, all of which are subject to change. Additionally, the Company's monitoring activities now consider future reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions to adjust all general reserve percentages as necessary. Balances are written off when determined to be uncollectible. Assuming there had been a 10% increase in uncollectible accounts over the 2020 recorded estimated allowance for doubtful accounts, pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2020 would have decreased by approximately $1.7 million.\nInventories\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which includes a reserve for excess, obsolete and/or unmarketable inventory. The Company estimates the reserve based upon current inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience as well as management's estimates of market conditions and forecasts of future product demand, all of which are subject to change. The calculation of the Company's reserve for excess, obsolete and/or unmarketable inventory requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory aging, forecasted consumer demand and pricing, regulatory (USGA and R&A) rule changes, the promotional environment and technological obsolescence. The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the reserve. However, if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or change, the Company may need to increase its inventory allowance, which could significantly adversely affect the Company's operating results. Assuming there had been a 10% increase in obsolete or unmarketable inventory over the 2020 recorded\nestimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory, pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2020 would have decreased by approximately $2.5 million.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually or more frequently whenever indicators are present that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable. To determine fair value, the Company uses cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate rate, quoted market prices, royalty rates when available and independent appraisals as appropriate. Any required impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the asset and a charge to earnings. The Company uses its best judgment based on current facts and circumstances related to its business when making these estimates. However, if actual results are not consistent with the Company's estimates and assumptions used in calculating future cash flows and asset fair values, the Company may be exposed to losses that could be material.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, due to the significant disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's operations, the Company performed a qualitative assessment considering the macroeconomic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the potential impact on the Company's sales and operating income for the remainder of fiscal 2020 and potentially beyond. Based on this assessment, the Company determined that there were indicators of impairment, and proceeded with a quantitative assessment of goodwill for all reporting units as well as for its indefinite-lived intangible assets. As a result, the Company recognized impairment losses of $148.4 million to write-off the goodwill associated with the Jack Wolfskin reporting unit, and $25.9 million to write-down the trade name associated with Jack Wolfskin to its new estimated fair value. The Company did not record further impairments in the second half of 2020. For further information, see Note 9 Goodwill and Intangible Assets\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nIncome Taxes\nCurrent income tax expense or benefit is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable or receivable for the current year. A deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability computed pursuant to ASC Topic 740 and its reported amount in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively. In accordance with the applicable accounting rules, the Company maintains a valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset when it is deemed to be more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating whether a valuation allowance is required under such rules, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including prior operating results, the nature and reason for any losses, its forecast of future taxable income, and the dates on which any deferred tax assets are expected to expire. These assumptions require a significant amount of judgment, including estimates of future taxable income. These estimates are based on the Company's best judgment at the time made based on current and projected circumstances and conditions. For further information, see Note 13 Income Taxes\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nPursuant to ASC Topic 740-25-6, the Company is required to accrue for the estimated additional amount of taxes for uncertain tax positions if it is deemed to be more likely than not that the Company would be required to pay such additional taxes. The Company is required to file federal and state income tax returns in the United States and various other income tax returns in foreign jurisdictions. The preparation of these income tax returns requires the Company to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions, which could affect the amount of tax paid by the Company. The Company accrues an amount for its estimate of additional tax liability, including interest and penalties in income tax expense, for any uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. The Company reviews and updates the accrual for uncertain tax positions as more definitive information becomes available. Historically, additional taxes paid as a result of the resolution of the Company's uncertain tax positions have not been materially different from the Company's expectations. The Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. For further information, see Note 13 Income Taxes.\u201d\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company is required to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, as well as the estimated useful life of those acquired intangible assets. Intangible assets may include the acquired company's trade name, existing customer relationships, developed technology, patents and goodwill. Significant estimates and assumptions used to value intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future revenues, growth rates, cash flows and discount rates. In addition, significant estimates and assumptions are used in determining uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances, as well as the fair value of equity awards assumed. The Company's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.\nDerivatives and Hedging\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to transactions of its international subsidiaries. As part of its strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company uses designated cash flow hedges and non-designated hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency translation on transactions that are denominated primarily in Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Euros, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars and Korean Won, and designated interest rate hedge contracts to mitigate the impact of variable interest rates on long-term debt.\nThe Company accounts for its foreign currency forward contracts, cross-currency debt swap contracts and interest rate hedge contracts in accordance with ASC Topic 815, \"Derivatives and Hedging\" (\"ASC Topic 815\"). ASC Topic 815 requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet, the measurement of those instruments at fair value and the recognition of changes in the fair value of derivatives in earnings in the period of change, unless the derivative qualifies as a designated cash flow hedge that offsets certain exposures. Certain criteria must be satisfied in order for derivative financial instruments to be classified and accounted for as a cash flow hedge. Gains and losses from the remeasurement of qualifying cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and released into earnings as a component of cost of goods sold or net sales, other income (expense) and interest expense during the period in which the hedged transaction takes place. Remeasurement gains or losses of derivatives that are not elected for hedge accounting treatment are recorded in earnings immediately as a component of other income (expense).\nForeign currency forward contracts and interest rate hedge contracts are used only to meet the Company's objectives of minimizing variability in the Company's operating results arising from foreign exchange rate movements and changes in interest rates. The Company does not enter into foreign currency forward contracts, cross-currency debt swap contracts and interest rate hedge contracts for speculative purposes. The Company utilizes counterparties for its derivative instruments that it believes are credit-worthy at the time the transactions are entered into and the Company closely monitors the credit ratings of these counterparties.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nInformation regarding recent accounting pronouncements is contained in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by this reference.\nDiscussion of Non-GAAP Measures\nIn addition to the financial results contained in this report, which have been prepared and presented in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, the Company has also included supplemental information concerning the Company's financial results on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP information includes the following:\n\u2022For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, certain of the Company's financial results were presented on a constant currency basis, which estimates what the Company's financial results would have been without changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This information is calculated by taking the current period local currency results and translating them into U.S. dollars based upon the foreign currency exchange rates for the applicable comparable prior period.\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2020, certain financial results exclude certain non-cash charges, including the recognition of an impairment loss to write-off goodwill and a portion of the trade name associated with Jack Wolfskin, amortization expense of intangible assets associated with the Jack Wolfskin, OGIO and TravisMathew acquisitions, amortization expense related to the discount of the Convertible Notes issued in May 2020, costs associated with the pending Topgolf merger, and other non-recurring expenses.\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2019, certain financial results exclude certain non-cash charges, including the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments associated with the Jack Wolfskin acquisition, amortization expense of intangible assets associated with the Jack Wolfskin, OGIO and TravisMathew acquisitions, and transaction and transition costs in connection with the Jack Wolfskin acquisition.\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2018, certain financial results exclude non-cash amortization expense of intangible assets associated with the OGIO and TravisMathew acquisitions.\nThe Company has included in this report information to reconcile this non-GAAP information to the most directly comparable GAAP information. The non-GAAP information presented in this report should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any measure derived in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP information may also be inconsistent with the manner in which similar measures are derived or used by other companies. Management uses such non-GAAP information for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period over period comparisons of the underlying performance of its business and in forecasting the Company's business going forward. Management believes that the presentation of such non-GAAP information, when considered in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP information, provides additional useful comparative information for investors in their assessment of the underlying performance of the Company's business.\nResults of Operations\nOverview of Business, Seasonality and Foreign Currency\nBusiness and Products\nThe Company designs, manufactures and sells a full line of high quality golf equipment, including golf clubs and golf balls, and apparel, gear and other products. The Company designs its golf products to be technologically advanced and in this regard invests a considerable amount in research and development each year. The Company designs its golf products for golfers of all skill levels, both amateur and professional. In addition, the Company designs and develops a full line of high quality soft goods, including golf bags, apparel, footwear and other golf accessories. In 2017, the Company expanded its soft goods lines with the acquisitions of OGIO and TravisMathew. Under the OGIO brand, the Company offers a full line of premium personal storage gear for sport and personal use, a line of performance outerwear for men, and golf and apparel accessories. TravisMathew offers a full line of premium golf and lifestyle apparel as well as footwear and accessories. In January 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of JW Stargazer Holding GmbH, the owner of the international, premium outdoor apparel, gear and accessories brand, Jack Wolfskin. This acquisition further enhanced the Company's lifestyle category and provides a platform for future growth in the active outdoor and urban outdoor categories. The Company's soft goods under the Callaway, OGIO, TravisMathew and Jack Wolfskin brands are largely designed and developed internally.\nPending Merger with Topgolf\nIn October 2020, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire Topgolf in an all-stock transaction, pursuant to a Merger Agreement by and among the Company, Topgolf and the Merger Sub. The Merger is expected to close during the first quarter of 2021, after which the former Topgolf stockholders (other than the Company) are expected to own approximately 48.5% of the combined company on a fully diluted basis. This Merger is expected to enable the combined company to accelerate innovation, develop exciting new products and experiences, and create compelling value for shareholders.\nThe Company currently estimates that it will issue approximately 90 million shares of its common stock to the stockholders of Topgolf (excluding the Company) for 100% of the outstanding equity of Topgolf, using an exchange ratio based on an equity value of Topgolf of approximately $1,986.0 million (or approximately $1,745.0 million excluding Topgolf shares currently held by the Company) and a price per share of the Company's common stock fixed at $19.40 per share. The actual purchase consideration upon the close of the Merger will be based on the estimated number of shares of the Company's common stock as discussed above, multiplied by the closing price of Company's common stock as of that day. As of December 31, 2020, the Company held approximately 14.3% of Topgolf's outstanding shares, which will be contributed towards that total purchase consideration. The Company will also recognize a gain, which is expected to be in excess of $200.0 million to write-up its pre-merger investment in Topgolf to its fair value, based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of the Merger. Upon completion of the Merger, the former Topgolf stockholders (other than the Company) are expected to own approximately 48.5% of the combined company on a fully diluted basis. Outstanding Topgolf stock options will be converted into options to purchase the Company's common stock, generally using the same exchange ratio. Additionally, the Company currently expects to acquire significant deferred tax assets related to tax carryforwards in the Proposed Merger. As a result of the propose merger it is possible a significant amount of the combined Company's deferred tax assets could expire unused and therefore the Company may be required to record a valuation allowance against all or a substantial portion of its net deferred tax assets, which could have a significant impact on the Company's tax provision in 2021. The analysis of this is complex and is subject to judgment based on information not yet available to the Company. The Company will make a more complete assessment of this following the merger and will record a valuation allowance, if appropriate.\nThe Merger Agreement further provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, either party may be required to pay the other party a termination fee of $75.0 million. The Merger is expected to close on or around March 8, 2021, subject to shareholder approval and other customary conditions (see Note 6 Business Combinations\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).\nOperating and Reportable Segments\nThe Company has two operating and reportable segments, namely Golf Equipment and Apparel, Gear and Other.\nThe Golf Equipment operating segment, which is comprised of golf club and golf ball products, includes Callaway Golf-branded woods, hybrids, irons, wedges, Odyssey putters, including Toulon Design putters by Odyssey, packaged sets, Callaway Golf and Strata branded golf balls and sales of pre-owned golf clubs.\nThe Apparel, Gear and Other operating segment includes the Jack Wolfskin outdoor apparel, gear and accessories business, the TravisMathew golf and lifestyle apparel and accessories business, and the Callaway soft goods business and the OGIO business, which consists of golf apparel and accessories (including golf bags and gloves), storage gear for sport and personal use, and royalties from licensing of the Company's trademarks and service marks for various soft goods products.\nIn connection with the pending Merger with Topgolf discussed above, the Company will reassess its operating and reportable segments at the time the Merger becomes final.\nCost of Sales\nThe Company's cost of sales is comprised primarily of material and component costs, distribution and warehousing costs, and overhead. Historically, over 85% of the Company's manufacturing costs, primarily material and component costs, are variable in nature and fluctuate with sales volumes. With respect to the Company's Golf Equipment operating segment, variable costs as a percentage of cost of sales range between 85% to 95% for golf club products and 70% to 80% for golf ball products. Variable costs for soft goods in the Apparel, Gear and Other operating segment are generally greater than 85% as fewer fixed costs are used in the manufacturing of soft goods products. Generally, the relative significance of the components of cost of sales does not vary materially from these percentages from period to period. See \"Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019-Segment Profitability\" and \"Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018-Segment Profitability\" below for further discussion of gross margins.\nSeasonality\nGolf Equipment\nIn most of the regions where the Company conducts business, the game of golf is played primarily on a seasonal basis. Weather conditions generally restrict golf from being played year-round, except in a few markets, with many of the Company's on-course customers closing for the cold weather months. The Company's golf equipment business is therefore subject to seasonal fluctuations. In general, during the first quarter, the Company begins selling its golf club and golf ball products into the golf retail channel for the new golf season. This initial sell-in generally continues into the second quarter. Second-quarter sales are significantly affected by the amount of reorder business of the products sold during the first quarter. Third-quarter sales are generally dependent on reorder business but can also include smaller new product launches, typically resulting in lower sales than the second quarter as many retailers begin decreasing their inventory levels in anticipation of the end of the golf season. Fourth-quarter sales are generally less than the other quarters due to the end of the golf season in many of the Company's key regions. However, third-quarter sales can be affected by a mid-year product launch, and fourth-quarter sales can be affected from time to time by the early launch of product introductions related to the new golf season of the subsequent year. This seasonality, and therefore quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, can be affected by many factors, including the timing of new product introductions as well as weather conditions. In general, because of this seasonality, a majority of the Company's sales from its Golf Equipment operating segment and most, if not all, of its profitability from this segment generally occurs during the first half of the year.\nApparel, Gear and Other\nSales of the Company's golf and lifestyle apparel, gear and accessories generally follow the same seasonality as golf equipment, and are therefore generally higher during the first half of the year. Sales of outdoor apparel, footwear and equipment related to the Jack Wolfskin business focuses primarily on outerwear and consequently experiences stronger sales for such products during the cold-weather months and the corresponding prior sell-in periods. Therefore, sales of Jack Wolfskin products are generally greater during the second half of the year.\nForeign Currency\nA significant portion of the Company's business is conducted outside of the United States in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign currency rates can have a significant effect on the Company's financial results. The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency rates. While these foreign currency forward contracts can mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency rates, they do not eliminate those effects, which can be significant. These effects include (i) the translation of results denominated in foreign currency into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, (ii) the mark-to-market adjustments of certain intercompany balance sheet accounts denominated in foreign currencies and (iii) the mark-to-market adjustments of the Company's foreign currency forward contracts. In general, the Company's overall financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which the Company conducts its business.\nExecutive Summary of Results of Operations\nNet sales for the full year in 2020 decreased $111.6 million or 6.6% to $1,589.5 million compared to $1,701.1million in 2019. This decrease reflects a $115.1 million or 15.9% decline in net sales of apparel, gear and other, offset by an increase of $3.5 million or 0.4% in net sales of golf equipment, compared to 2019. The overall decline in net sales in 2020 reflects the challenges the Company faced as the result of the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily during the first half of 2020 at the height of the worldwide regulatory restrictions, which resulted in the temporary closure of the Company's retail locations, manufacturing facilities and distribution centers at varying times. The Company began to see signs of improvement coming out of the second quarter of 2020, and in the third and fourth quarters of 2020, the Company experienced record sales due to an unprecedented demand for golf equipment, particularly in the United States and Europe, due to an increased interest in the game of golf, as it supports an active and healthy way of life that is compatible with social distancing. This surge in golf equipment sales also reflects the strength of the Company's product offerings across all skill levels. Additionally, although sales of apparel, gear and other were down substantially for the full year, these soft goods sales rebounded faster than anticipated during the second half of the year, led by the TravisMathew and Jack Wolfskin apparel businesses, which have benefited from strong brand momentum combined with increased outdoor consumer activity. In addition, as government mandated restrictions and retail store closures limited consumers' ability to shop in-store, the Company experienced a higher mix of e-commerce sales in 2020, which increased overall by 34.5%\ncompared to e-commerce sales in 2019. The Company anticipates this trend will continue into 2021. Overall, the Company is encouraged that sales in all of its businesses are improving since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCOVID-19 also negatively impacted the Company's gross margin. More specifically, the Company's 2020 full year gross margin compared to 2019 declined 370 basis points primarily due to the decrease in sales, the shutdown of its manufacturing plants during the year and the Company's proactive inventory reduction initiatives. To mitigate the effects of COVID-19 on the Company's business, the Company took proactive actions to protect its employees, reduce costs, maximize liquidity, and conserve cash. Reductions in discretionary spending and infrastructure costs, including a reduction in workforce, reduced marketing and travel expenses, and voluntary reductions in compensation by the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer and other members of senior management, have resulted in a significant reduction in planned operating expenses and capital expenditures. As a result of these cost reduction initiatives, the Company realized net savings in operating expenses of $45.3 million (7.1%) (excluding impairment charges of $174.3 million) for the full year in 2020 compared to 2019.\nAfter COVID-19 began, the Company also focused on maximizing cash and liquidity, including the inventory reduction initiatives to generate cash and tight management of working capital generally, combined with the suspension of open market stock repurchases and the cessation of the Company's quarterly dividend. Due to these efforts to maximize cash and liquidity, reduced discretionary spending, and overall business improvement, at December 31, 2020, the Company's liquidity, consisting of cash, including proceeds from the convertible senior notes issued in May 2020, combined with availability under its credit facilities, increased to $632.4 million compared to $303.3 million at December 31, 2019.\nLooking forward, the Company anticipates that COVID-19 will continue to negatively impact its business in 2021 as a result of the continued government shutdown orders and other restrictions around the world, although to a lesser degree than in 2020. All of the Company's business segments, as well as the Topgolf business, support an active outdoor lifestyle that is compatible with a world of social distancing and the Company anticipates that its continued brand momentum, increased demand for golf equipment and recovery in its soft goods business will continue into 2021, and therefore help mitigate the impact of COVID-19.\nYears Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $111.6 million (6.6%) to $1,589.5 million compared to $1,701.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease reflects a $115.1 million or 15.9% decline in sales of apparel, gear and other resulting from the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the temporary closure of most of the Company's operations and retail doors during the second quarter of 2020, with additional closures in the fourth quarter of 2020. This decrease was partially offset by the golf equipment segment, which saw strong momentum during the second half of the year and resulted in a $3.5 million or 0.4% increase in sales of golf equipment. In addition, due to government mandated restrictions and retail store closures, the Company experienced a higher mix of e-commerce sales, which increased overall by 34.5% in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in net sales also reflects the favorable impact of $10.8 million due to fluctuations in foreign currencies for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe Company's net sales by operating segment are presented below (dollars in millions):\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Growth/(Decline) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollars </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Golf Equipment </td> <td>$ </td> <td>982.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>979.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Apparel, Gear and Other </td> <td>606.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>721.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(115.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15.9) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,589.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,701.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(111.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.6) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor further discussion of each operating segment's results, see \"Operating Segments Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\" below.\nNet sales information by region is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Decline </td> <td> </td> <td>Constant Currency\nDecline vs. 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollars </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States </td> <td>$ </td> <td>778.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>788.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.2) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.2)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe </td> <td>373.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>428.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(55.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.0) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(14.7)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Japan </td> <td>212.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>246.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(34.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.9) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(15.6)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rest of World </td> <td>225.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>238.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.1) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.8)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,589.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,701.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(111.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.6) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.2)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales in the United States decreased $9.6 million (1.2%) to $778.6 million during 2020 compared to $788.2 million in 2019. Net sales in regions outside of the United States decreased $102.0 million (11.2%) to $810.9 million in 2020 compared to $912.9 million in 2019. Fluctuations in foreign currencies had a favorable impact on international net sales of $10.8 million in 2020 relative to the prior year. The general decrease in net sales by region was primarily due to the business disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as discussed above, partially offset by increased sales of golf equipment resulting from the popularity of golf as a social-distancing activity. The significant decline in Europe was primarily due to a decline in sales of soft goods in that region as the result of the temporary closure of retail stores during the second quarter of 2020, and again, to a lesser extent in the fourth quarter of 2020. The decline in Japan was due to a region specific product launch in 2019 and no similar launch in 2020, combined with a slower recovery of their apparel business, which was more heavily impacted by the pandemic.\nGross profit decreased $109.2 million to $657.6 million in 2020 from $766.8 million in 2019. Gross profit as a percent of net sales (\"gross margin\") decreased 370 basis points to 41.4% in 2020 from 45.1% in 2019. The decline in gross profit was primarily due to the overall decline in sales related to the COVID-19 pandemic, proactive soft goods inventory reduction initiatives, costs associated with idle facilities during the government mandated shutdown and increased freight expense in the back-half of 2020. These declines were partially offset by favorable changes in foreign currency as well as a higher mix of e-commerce sales, which have higher gross margins. For a further discussion of gross margin, see \"Segment Profitability\" below.\nSelling expenses decreased by $46.4 million to $391.8 million (24.7% of net sales) in 2020 compared to $438.2 million (25.8% of net sales) in 2019. This 10.6% decrease was primarily due to the Company's planned reduction in operating expenses in response to the decline in sales caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. These reductions consisted of a $23.6 million decline in marketing and tour expenses due to the cancellation of golf events, a $11.5 million decline in employee costs as a result of the Company's cost reduction initiatives in response to COVID-19, and a $8.3 million decline in employee travel expenses due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, as well as an overall decline in variable expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $5.4 million to $150.7 million (9.5% of net sales) in 2020 compared to $145.3 million (8.5% of net sales) in 2019. This 3.7% increase was primarily due to a $10.9 million increase in legal expenses and professional fees, and a $2.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense. These increases were partially offset by a $6.5 million decline in employee costs as a result of the Company's cost reduction initiatives in response to COVID-19, and a $2.1 million decline in travel expenses due to COVID-19 travel restrictions.\nResearch and development expenses decreased by $4.3 million to $46.3 million (2.9% of net sales) in 2020 compared to $50.6 million (3.0% of net sales) in 2019. This 8.5% decrease was primarily due to a $4.1 million decline in employee costs resulting from the Company's cost reduction initiatives, and a $1.2 million decline in travel and entertainment as a result of travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDue to the significant business disruption and macro-economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $174.3 million to write-off goodwill and a portion of the trade name associated with Jack Wolfskin. For further discussion, see Note 9 \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets\" to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nInterest expense increased by $8.1 million to $47.4 million in 2020 compared to $39.3 million in 2019 primarily due to the issuance of $258.8 million in Convertible Notes in May 2020 partially offset by a decrease resulting from repayments on the Term Loan Facility and lower outstanding borrowings on the Company's credit facilities (see Note 7\n\"Financing Arrangements\" and Note 19 \"Derivatives and Hedging\" to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).\nOther income increased by $23.4 million to $25.0 million in 2020 compared to $1.6 million in 2019. This increase was due to a $14.8 million increase in net foreign currency transaction gains, combined with the recognition of an $11.0 million net gain in connection with the settlement of a cross-currency swap contract. These increases were partially offset by a net decrease of $4.0 million on gains related to hedging contracts.\nThe provision for income taxes decreased by $17.0 million to a tax benefit of $0.5 million in 2020, compared to a tax provision of $16.5 million in 2019. The Company's effective tax rate as a percentage of pre-tax loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased to 0.4%, compared to 17.3% as a percent of pre-tax income in the comparable period of 2019. This decrease was primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge recorded during the second quarter of 2020, which is non-deductible for tax purposes combined with an overall decline in pre-tax earnings in 2020 compared to 2019. For further discussion, see Note 13 \"Income Taxes\" to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nNet income/loss in 2020 decreased to a net loss of $126.9 million compared to net income of $79.4 million in 2019. Diluted earnings/loss per share decreased $2.17 to a loss per share of $1.35 in 2020 compared to earnings per share of $0.82 in 2019.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, excluding the items described in the table following this paragraph, the Company's net income and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2020 would have been $64.4 million and $0.67 per share, respectively, compared to $105.7 million and $1.10 per share, respectively, for the comparative period in 2019. The decrease in non-GAAP earnings in 2020 was primarily due to the business disruptions and challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020, which resulted in a significant decline in net sales and operating income compared to 2019, partially offset by the Company's planned cost reduction initiatives in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as decreased travel and entertainment expenses, lower variable expenses due to lower sales, and reduced spending in marketing and tour expenses. In addition, non-GAAP net income for 2020 includes a net gain that was recognized in connection with the settlement of a cross-currency swap contract as well as the favorable impact of changes in foreign currencies. All the foregoing was offset by the Company's continued investments in its new businesses.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of the Company's results under GAAP for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 to the Company's non-GAAP results as defined above for the same periods (in millions, except per share information).\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As Reported </td> <td> </td> <td>Non-Cash Amortization of Intangible Assets and Impairment Charges (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Non-Cash Amortization of Discount on Convertible Notes(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Acquisition and Other Costs(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Non-GAAP(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) attributable to Callaway Golf Company </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(126.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(170.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(16.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted earnings (loss) per share </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1.35) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1.81) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.05) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.17) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.67 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted-average shares outstanding </td> <td>94.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>94.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>94.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>94.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As Reported </td> <td> </td> <td>Non-Cash Amortization of Intangible Assets(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Acquisition and Transition Costs(5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Non-GAAP </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) attributable to Callaway Golf Company </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>79.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(13.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(12.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>105.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted earnings (loss) per share </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.82 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.15) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.13) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted-average shares outstanding </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Includes the non-cash amortization expense of intangible assets in connection with the acquisitions of Jack Wolfskin, TravisMathew and OGIO.

Net sales information for the Golf Equipment segment by product category is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Growth/(Decline) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollars </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Golf Clubs </td> <td>$ </td> <td>787.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>768.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Golf Balls </td> <td>195.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>210.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.3) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>982.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>979.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales of Golf Clubs increased $18.8 million (2.4%) to $787.1 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in sales volume, partially offset by a decline in average selling prices. The increase in sales volume was driven by an increase in the popularity of golf as a result of the heightened demand for outdoor, socially-distanced activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Also due to the pandemic, sales of golf equipment through the Company's e-commerce channel increased by approximately 24.0% in 2020 compared to 2019. The decline in average selling prices was primarily due to the current year launch of the Mavrik line of drivers and irons, which have a lower average selling price compared to the Epic Flash drivers and Apex irons launched in 2019, combined with a shift in sales mix to lower margin pre-owned products.\nNet sales of Golf Balls decreased $15.3 million (7.3%) to $195.6 million in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to a decline in sales volume and flat average selling prices. The decline in sales volume was due to the business disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic during the first half of 2020, including the delayed launch of the Chrome Soft X golf balls, which occurred later in the second quarter of 2020 than originally anticipated. This decline was partially offset by an increase in sales in the third and fourth quarters due to the popularity of golf as a socially-distanced activity.\nApparel, Gear and Other\nApparel, Gear and Other sales decreased $115.1 million (15.9%) to $606.8 million in 2020 compared to $721.9 million in 2019 primarily due to the business disruptions and challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in e-commerce sales, which increased by approximately 56.0% in 2020 compared to 2019. Net sales information for the Apparel, Gear and Other segment is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Decline </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollars </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Apparel </td> <td>$ </td> <td>349.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>410.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(61.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15.0) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gear, Accessories & Other </td> <td>257.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>311.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(53.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17.3) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>606.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>721.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(115.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15.9) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales of Apparel decreased $61.4 million (15.0%) to $349.3 million in 2020 compared to 2019 due to a decline in sales across all apparel brands as a result of the business challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the temporary closure of retail stores in most major markets, primarily during the second quarter of 2020, combined with additional closures during the fourth quarter of 2020.\nNet sales of Gear, Accessories & Other decreased $53.7 million (17.3%) to $257.5 million in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to a decline in sales of OGIO-branded bags and Callaway-branded golf bags resulting from the business challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the Company moved a portion of the OGIO business to a licensing arrangement during the current year.\nSegment Profitability\nProfitability by operating segment is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Growth/(Decline) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollars </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Golf Equipment </td> <td>$ </td> <td>148.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>140.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Apparel, Gear and Other </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(74.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(99.1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciling items(1)\n</td> <td>(276.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(120.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(156.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>130.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(127.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>95.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(223.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(233.1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Reconciling items represent corporate general and administrative expenses and other income (expense) not included by management in determining segment profitability.

These increases were partially offset by a $23.4 million increase in other income primarily due to foreign currency and hedging contract gains, and a $10.9 million decrease in amortization expense recognized in 2019 related to the inventory valuation step-up from the Jack Wolfskin acquisition (see Note 6 \"Business Combinations\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).\nPre-tax income in the Company's Golf Equipment operating segment improved to $148.6 million in 2020 from $140.3 million in 2019. This improvement was primarily due to a $36.0 million decrease in operating expenses, partially offset by a $27.7 million decline in gross profit (a decline of 300 basis points in gross margin). The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to decreases in marketing expenses and employee costs resulting from the Company's cost reduction initiatives in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to decreases in employee travel costs and tour expense resulting from travel restrictions and canceled golf tournaments caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The decline in gross margin was largely due to lower sales and the negative impact of idle facilities during the government mandated shutdown during the first half of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and increased freight expense in the back-half of 2020. This decline was partially offset by a higher mix of direct-to-consumer e-commerce sales, which have higher margins relative the Company's wholesale business.\nPre-tax income in the Company's Apparel, Gear and Other operating segment decreased to $0.7 million in 2020 from $75.5 million in 2019. This decrease was primarily due to a $86.9 million decrease in gross profit (a decline of 540 basis points in gross margin), partially offset by a $12.1 million decrease in operating expenses. The decline in gross margin was\nprimarily due to the Company's proactive soft goods inventory reduction initiatives combined with the negative impact of idle facilities during the government mandated shutdown, fixed costs on the lower sales base caused by the temporary shut-down of the Company's distribution centers and retail locations primarily during the first half of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These declines were partially offset by a higher mix of direct to consumer e-commerce sales, which have higher gross margins relative to the Company's wholesale business. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to decreases in marketing expenses and employee costs resulting from the Company's cost reduction initiatives in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to a decrease in employee travel costs as the result of travel restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nYears Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $458.3 million (36.9%) to $1,701.1 million compared to $1,242.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to the Company's acquisition of the outdoor apparel, gear and accessories company, Jack Wolfskin, which added incremental sales of $356.2 million to the Company's Apparel, Gear and Other operating segment. Excluding this acquisition, net sales increased $102.0 million (8.2%) for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, primarily due to a 7.3% increase in the Golf Equipment segment as well as the continued success of the TravisMathew apparel business. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 would have been $31.2 million higher using average foreign exchange rates in effect in 2018.\nThe Company's net sales by operating segment are presented below (dollars in millions):\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Growth </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Dollars </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Golf Equipment </td> <td>$ </td> <td>979.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>912.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Apparel, Gear and Other </td> <td>721.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>329.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>392.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>118.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,701.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,242.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>458.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)The Company changed its operating segments as of January 1, 2019.

As a result, starting on January 1, 2019, the Company began to report regional sales previously reported in rest of Asia and other foreign countries in rest of world. Accordingly, the prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation of regional sales.\nNet sales in the United States increased $79.7 million (11.2%) to $788.2 million during 2019 compared to $708.5 million in 2018. Net sales in regions outside of the United States increased $378.6 million (70.9%) to $912.9 million in 2019 compared to $534.3 million in 2018. Fluctuations in foreign currencies had an unfavorable impact on international net sales of $31.2 million in 2019 relative to the prior year. The increase in net sales by region includes the following:\n\u2022In the United States, the increase was primarily due to an increase in sales of golf equipment combined with an increase in apparel sales due to the continued growth of the Travis Mathew business.\n\u2022In Europe, the increase was primarily due to incremental apparel sales resulting from the Jack Wolfskin acquisition completed in January 2019, combined with an increase in sales of golf equipment, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations on sales.\n\u2022The increase in Japan was primarily due to an increase in sales of golf equipment.\n\u2022The increase in Rest of World was primarily driven by incremental apparel sales in China resulting from the Jack Wolfskin acquisition completed in January 2019, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations on sales.\nGross profit increased $188.4 million to $766.8 million in 2019 from $578.4 million in 2018. Gross profit as a percent of net sales (\"gross margin\") decreased 140 basis points to 45.1% in 2019 from 46.5% in 2018. This decrease was primarily due to amortization charges of $10.9 million related to a fair value adjustment to Jack Wolfskin's inventory recorded as part of the Company's purchase price allocation, which resulted in a negative impact to gross margin of 60 basis points. The remaining decrease in margin of 80 basis points was due to a shift in current year product mix in the golf equipment segment to sales of more premium products, which generally have lower margins due to more advanced technology, combined with the negative impact of increased tariff expense and unfavorable changes in foreign currency rates. These decreases were partially offset by sales growth from the Company's TravisMathew business, which is accretive to gross margin. For a further discussion of gross margin, see \"Segment Profitability\" below.\nSelling expenses increased by $129.5 million to $438.2 million (25.8% of net sales) in 2019 compared to $308.7 million (24.8% of net sales) in 2018. This increase reflects $114.4 million of incremental costs resulting from the addition of the Jack Wolfskin business, a $5.9 million increase in employee costs, and a $3.8 million increase in professional fees as a result of additional investments in the business to sustain the Company's growth.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $44.8 million to $145.3 million (8.5% of net sales) in 2019 compared to $100.5 million (8.1% of net sales) in 2018. This increase was primarily due to $30.1 million of incremental costs resulting from the addition of the Jack Wolfskin business, in addition to increases of $10.6 million in transaction and transition costs related to the Jack Wolfskin acquisition combined with expense from the purchase accounting amortization of intangible assets, and $3.6 million in legal expense.\nResearch and development expenses increased by $9.8 million to $50.6 million (3.0% of net sales) in 2019 compared to $40.8 million (3.3% of net sales) in 2018. This increase was primarily due to $9.3 million of incremental costs resulting from the addition of the Jack Wolfskin business.\nInterest expense increased by $33.8 million to $39.3 million in 2019 compared to $5.5 million in 2018 primarily due to $31.7 million of incremental interest expense recognized from the Term Loan Facility and related debt issuance costs in connection with the Jack Wolfskin acquisition completed in January 2019 (see Note 6 \"Business Combinations\" and Note 7 \"Financing Arrangements\" to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).\nOther income decreased by $6.2 million to $1.6 million in 2019 compared to $7.8 million in 2018 primarily due to the recognition of a net loss of $3.9 million from the remeasurement of a foreign currency forward contract that was put in place to mitigate the risk of foreign currency fluctuations on the acquisition of Jack Wolfskin, combined with a decline in net foreign currency gains from non-designated foreign currency hedging contracts, and an increase in net foreign currency transaction losses year over year.\nThe provision for income taxes decreased by $9.5 million to $16.5 million in 2019, compared to $26.0 million in 2018 primarily due to the decline in pre-tax income. As a percentage of pre-tax income, the Company's effective tax rate during 2019 declined to 17.3% compared to 19.8% in 2018 primarily due to a shift in the mix of foreign earnings relative to the prior year. For further discussion, see Note 13 \"Income Taxes\" to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nNet income in 2019 decreased 24.2% to $79.4 million compared to $104.7 million in 2018. Diluted earnings per share decreased to $0.82 in 2019 compared to $1.08 in 2018. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding after-tax acquisition related costs as well as certain hedging losses associated with the purchase price of Jack Wolfskin, and excluding after-tax purchase accounting amortization expenses related to the Jack Wolfskin, TravisMathew and OGIO acquisitions, the Company's net income and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2019 would have been $105.7 million and $1.10\nper share compared to $104.9 million and $1.08 per share for the comparative period in 2018. The increased non-GAAP earnings in 2019 is primarily due to the new Jack Wolfskin business combined with growth in the TravisMathew business, the success of the golf equipment product lines launched in 2019, in addition to a lower tax rate, partially offset by a $33.8 million increase in interest expense primarily as a result of the new Term Loan Facility to fund the purchase of Jack Wolfskin.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of the Company's results under GAAP for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 to the Company's non-GAAP results as defined above for the same periods (in millions, except per share information).\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>GAAP </td> <td> </td> <td>Acquisition and Other Non-Recurring Expenses(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Non-Cash Purchase Accounting Adjustments(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Non-GAAP </td> <td> </td> <td>GAAP </td> <td> </td> <td>Acquisition and Other Non-Recurring Expenses(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Non-Cash Purchase Accounting Adjustments(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Non-GAAP </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) attributable to Callaway Golf Company\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>79.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(13.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(12.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>105.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>104.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>104.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted earnings (loss) per share\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.82 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.15) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.13) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.08 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.01 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.01) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.08 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted-average shares outstanding </td> <td>96.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Represents non-recurring transaction fees, including banker's fees, legal fees, consulting and travel, and transition costs, including consulting, audit fees and valuations services associated with the acquisition of Jack Wolfskin completed in January 2019, as well as other non-recurring advisory fees.

Net sales for Golf Equipment in 2019 reflect $11.6 million of unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency rates.\nNet sales information for the Golf Equipment segment by product category is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Growth </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollars </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Golf Clubs </td> <td>$ </td> <td>768.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>717.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Golf Balls </td> <td>210.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>195.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>979.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>912.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales of Golf Clubs increased $51.0 million (7.1%) to $768.3 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to increases in sales of irons and putters, partially offset by a decline in sales of woods. Net sales of irons and wedges increased due to the successful launch of the Apex and Big Bertha premium lines of irons in 2019 in addition to the 2019 launch of the Epic Forged premium line of irons and MD5 Jaws wedges with no comparable models launched in 2018, combined with the continued success of the prior year Rogue line of irons and MD4 wedges. The increase in putter sales was due to the success of the new platform of Stroke Lab putters launched in 2019. Net sales of woods declined due to the wide success of the Rogue line of fairway woods in 2018, which was a larger core product launch targeted toward a larger\nsegment of the market compared to the premium Epic Flash line of fairway woods launched in 2019. Net sales of golf clubs were negatively impacted by $9.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations period over period.\nNet sales of Golf Balls increased $15.3 million (7.8%) to $210.9 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the successful launch of the new ERC and Chrome Soft X Triple Track and Supersoft lines of golf balls in 2019, combined with the continued success of the 2018 Truvis and Chrome Soft golf balls, which resulted in an overall increase in market share period over period. Net sales of golf balls were negatively impacted by $2.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations period over period.\nApparel, Gear and Other\nNet sales information for the Apparel, Gear and Other segment is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Growth </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollars </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Apparel </td> <td>$ </td> <td>410.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>112.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>298.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>266.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gear, Accessories & Other </td> <td>311.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>217.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>721.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>329.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>392.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>118.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales of Apparel increased $298.5 million (266.0%) to $410.7 million in 2019 compared to 2018. This increase was primarily due to incremental sales of outdoor apparel, gear and accessories as a result of the acquisition of Jack Wolfskin in January 2019, combined with the continued success of the TravisMathew apparel business. This increase in TravisMathew sales resulted from brand momentum, an increase in their wholesale business and an increase in direct-to-consumer sales due in part to the opening of five new retail stores in 2019 and six new retail stores in 2018. Net sales of apparel were negatively impacted by $12.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations period over period.\nNet sales of Gear, Accessories & Other increased $93.5 million (42.9%) to $311.2 million in 2019 compared to 2018. This increase was primarily due to the addition of Jack Wolfskin, combined with an increase in sales of Callaway-branded golf gloves. Net sales of gear, accessories and other were negatively impacted by $7.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations period over period.\nSegment Profitability\nProfitability by operating segment is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Growth </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollars </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Golf Equipment\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>140.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>128.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Apparel, Gear and Other </td> <td>75.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciling items(1)\n</td> <td>(120.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(52.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(67.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>129.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>95.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>131.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(35.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Reconciling items represent corporate general and administrative expenses and other income (expense) not included by management in determining segment profitability. The $67.8 million increase in reconciling items in 2019 compared to 2018 includes incremental corporate general and administrative expenses associated with the addition of the Jack Wolfskin business in January 2019, in addition to $34.1 million in non-recurring charges that include (i) transition costs associated with the acquisition of Jack Wolfskin, (ii) the amortization of intangible assets and the cost impact associated with a change in valuation of inventory (inventory step-up) related to the Company's Jack Wolfskin acquisition, and (iii) amortization charges of intangible assets related to the Company's OGIO and TravisMathew acquisitions. Reconciling items in 2019 also include incremental interest expense of $31.7 million related to the Term Loan Facility used for the Jack Wolfskin acquisition as well as $3.9 million of net foreign currency exchange losses associated with the Jack Wolfskin acquisition. In 2018, reconciling items include $7.3 million of net foreign currency exchange gains, and $3.7 million of transaction costs associated with the Jack Wolfskin acquisition. For information\non the acquisition of Jack Wolfskin and the Company's credit facilities and long-term debt obligations see Note 6 \"Business Combinations\" and Note 7 \"Financing Arrangements\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K .\nPre-tax income in the Company's Golf Equipment operating segment improved to $140.3 million in 2019 from $128.6 million in 2018. This improvement was primarily due to a $13.3 million increase in gross profit as a result of the increase in net sales as discussed above, partially offset by a decline in gross margin due to a more premium mix of products sold in 2019 compared to 2018, which generally have lower margins due to the higher cost of more advanced technology, in addition to the recognition of higher golf ball manufacturing costs in 2019 associated with the complexity of managing production while completing major capital improvements on the golf ball manufacturing facility. The increase in gross profit was offset by a $1.6 million increase in operating expenses primarily to support the revenue growth period over period, combined with the negative impact from unfavorable changes in foreign currency rates.\nPre-tax income in the Company's Apparel, Gear and Other operating segment increased to $75.5 million in 2019 from $54.9 million in 2018 primarily due to the addition of the Jack Wolfskin business in January 2019, combined with an improvement in gross margin as a result of the continued success of the TravisMathew apparel business, partially offset by the negative impact of unfavorable changes in foreign currency rates.\nFinancial Condition\nThe Company's cash and cash equivalents increased $259.5 million to $366.1 million at December 31, 2020, from $106.7 million at December 31, 2019, primarily due to proceeds of $258.8 million from the Convertible Notes issued in May 2020 combined with tight working capital management and the Company's cost reduction actions taken in response to COVID-19. This improvement in liquidity was partially offset by the overall decline in earnings period over period due to the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's business during 2020. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company used its cash and cash equivalents combined with the proceeds from the issuance of the Convertible Notes to fund its operations, repay $134.9 million of amounts outstanding under its credit and long-term debt facilities, fund capital expenditures of $39.3 million, primarily for the Company's transition of its North America distribution center to a new facility, investments in its golf ball manufacturing plant and for the implementation of new IT systems. The Company further invested $20.0 million in Topgolf, and repurchased shares of its common stock for $22.2 million. In addition, in connection with the Convertible Notes, the Company paid a premium of $31.8 million for capped call transactions, which are expected to generally reduce the potential dilution to the Company's common stock upon any conversion of the notes. Management expects to fund the Company's future operations from current cash balances and cash provided by its operating activities, combined with borrowings under its current and future credit facilities as well as from other available sources of capital, as deemed necessary. See Note 7 \"Financing Arrangements\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information on the Company's credit facilities, Term Loan Facility and Convertible Notes.\nThe Company's accounts receivable balance fluctuates throughout the year as a result of the general seasonality of the Company's business and is also affected by the timing of new product launches. With respect to the Company's Golf Equipment business, the accounts receivable balance will generally be at its highest during the first and second quarters due to the seasonal peak in the golf season, and it will generally decline significantly during the third and fourth quarters as a result of an increase in cash collections and lower sales. The Company's Apparel, Gear and Other accounts receivable balances are expected to be higher during the second half of the year due to the seasonal nature of the Jack Wolfskin business, with a significant portion of its products geared toward the fall/winter season. As of December 31, 2020, the Company's net accounts receivable decreased to $138.5 million from $140.5 million as of December 31, 2019. This $2.0 million decrease was primarily driven by an increase in the reserves for bad debt for certain slow-paying customers impacted by COVID-19, partially offset by an increase in trade receivables resulting from the overall increase in sales of both golf equipment and apparel during the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.\nThe Company's inventory balance fluctuates throughout the year as a result of the general seasonality of the Company's business and is also affected by the timing of new product launches. With respect to the Company's Golf Equipment business, the buildup of inventory levels generally begins during the fourth quarter and continues heavily into the first quarter as well as into the beginning of the second quarter in order to meet demand during the height of the golf season. Inventory levels are also impacted by the timing of new product launches as well as the success of new products. Apparel, Gear and Other inventory levels start to build in the second quarter and continues into the third and fourth quarters\ndue to the seasonal nature of the Jack Wolfskin business, as many of its products are geared toward the fall/winter season. The Company's inventories decreased to $352.5 million as of December 31, 2020 from $456.6 million as of December 31, 2019. This $104.1 million decrease was primarily due to the Company's working capital management, including the Company's proactive soft goods inventory reduction initiatives, combined with an increase in demand for golf equipment as the result of the increased popularity of golf in the current COVID-19 environment. Inventories as a percentage of trailing 12 months net sales decreased to 22.0% as of December 31, 2020 compared to 27.9% as of December 31, 2019.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nThe Company's principal sources of liquidity consist of its existing cash balances, including cash from the issuance of the Convertible Notes in May 2020, funds expected to be generated from operations and funds from its credit facilities. Based upon the Company's current cash balances, its estimates of funds expected to be generated from operations in 2021, as well as from current and projected availability under its current or future credit facilities, the Company believes that it will be able to finance current and planned operating requirements, capital expenditures, required debt repayments and contractual obligations and commercial commitments for at least the next 12 months from the issuance of this Form 10-K.\nThe Company's ability to generate sufficient positive cash flows from operations is subject to many risks and uncertainties, including future economic trends and conditions, the future economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for the Company's products, foreign currency exchange rates, as well as the Company's pending merger with Topgolf, which was announced in October 2020, in addition to other risks and uncertainties applicable to the Company and its business (see Risk Factors\u201d contained in Part I, Item 1A in this Form 10-K). Given the uncertain duration of the COVID-19-related impact, the Company has proactively taken actions to significantly reduce costs, maximize liquidity and conserve cash for as long as may be required in light of current conditions. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company achieved significant planned reductions in operating expenses and capital expenditures by reducing discretionary spending and infrastructure costs on a worldwide basis, which included reductions in workforce, marketing and travel expenses, as well as voluntary reductions in compensation by the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer and other members of senior management. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $632.2 million in cash and availability under its credit facilities, which is an increase of $329.1 million compared to December 31, 2019. Information about the Company's credit facilities and long-term borrowings is presented in Note 7 Financing Arrangements\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K, and is incorporated herein by this reference.\nIn October 2020, the Company entered into a Merger Agreement to acquire Topgolf in an all-stock transaction (see Note 6 \"Business Combinations\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K). In connection with the Merger with Topgolf, the Company anticipates it will assume long-term debt, net of cash, of approximately $550.0 million to $600.0 million. The Company believes that with its continued strong cash generation and increased available liquidity on its debt facilities, its geographic diversity and the strength of its brands, it will be able to fund Topgolf's growth while simultaneously paying its other obligations.\nIn order to permit the consummation of the Merger with Topgolf, in October 2020, the Company also amended its ABL and Term Loan facilities. The ABL Facility amendment designates Topgolf and its subsidiaries as excluded subsidiaries under the ABL Facility and amends certain covenants and other provisions to allow the Company to make certain investments in, and enter into certain transactions with Topgolf, among other things. The amendment to the Term Loan Facility permits the consummation of the Merger with Topgolf and certain other transactions contemplated in the Merger Agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 50% of the Company's cash was held in regions outside of the United States. Due to changes enacted by the Tax Act in December 2017, incremental U.S. federal income tax is no longer a consideration if the Company were to repatriate cash to the United States outside of settling intercompany balances. However, if the Company were to repatriate such cash, it may need to pay incremental foreign withholding taxes which, subject to certain limitations, generate foreign tax credits for use against the Company's U.S. tax liability, if any. Additionally, the Company may need to pay certain state income taxes. The Company continues to maintain its indefinite reinvestment assertion with respect to most jurisdictions in which it operates because of local cash requirements to operate its business.\nShare Repurchases\nInformation about the Company's share repurchases during 2020 is presented in Part II, Item 5 in this Form 10-K under the heading \"Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers,\" which is incorporated herein by this reference.\nOther Significant Cash and Contractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes certain significant cash obligations as of December 31, 2020 that will affect the Company's future liquidity (in millions):\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

fund the purchase price of the Jack Wolfskin acquisition, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement which provided for a Term Loan Facility in an aggregate principal of $480.0 million, which was issued less $9.6 million in original issue discount and other transaction fees. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $441.6 million outstanding under the Term Loan Facility, which is offset by unamortized debt issuance costs of $13.5 million as presented on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. The Term Loan Facility is due in January 2026. For further discussion, see Note 7 \"Financing Arrangements\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\n(2)In August 2020, the Company entered into the Japan Term Loan Facility for $2,000.0 million Yen (or approximately U.S. $19.4 million using the exchange rate in effect as of December 31, 2020). The Company had $1,900.0 million Yen (or approximately U.S. $18.4 million using the exchange rate in effect as of December 31, 2020) outstanding under the Japan Term Loan Facility on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. The Japan Term Loan Facility is due in August 2025. For further discussion, see Note 7 \"Financing Arrangements\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\n(3)In May 2020, the Company issued $258.8 million of 2.75% Convertible Notes, which mature on May 1, 2026 unless earlier redeemed or repurchased by the Company or converted. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $183.1 million outstanding under the Convertible Notes, net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $5.5 million and debt discount of $70.1 million, as presented on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. The Convertible Notes will mature on May 1, 2026. For further discussion, see Note 7 \"Financing Arrangements\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\n(4)In August 2020, the Company entered into two new long-term financing agreements in connection with the Company's investment initiatives at its North American distribution center in Fort Worth, Texas, and in addition, to improve its manufacturing capabilities at its golf ball manufacturing facility in Chicopee, Massachusetts, the Company entered into a series of long-term financing agreements (collectively, the \"Equipment Notes\") between 2017 and 2020 that are\nsecured by certain equipment at this facility. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had an aggregate of $31.8 million outstanding under these notes. The Equipment Notes have maturity dates between December 2022 and March 2027. For further discussion, see Note 7 \"Financing Arrangements\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\n(5)In connection with lease of the Company's North American distribution Center, the Company financed certain building improvements of $3.8 million, of which $0.2 million was recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and $3.6 million was recorded in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. This financing arrangement is due in February 2035.\n(6)The Company leases certain warehouse, distribution and office facilities, vehicles and office equipment under operating leases. The amounts presented in this line item represent commitments for minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases. At December 31, 2020, short-term and long-term operating lease liabilities of $29.6 million and $178.0 million, respectively, were recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. For further discussion, see Note 3 \"Leases\" in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\n(7)During the normal course of its business, the Company enters into agreements to purchase goods and services, including purchase commitments for production materials, endorsement agreements with professional golfers and other endorsers, employment and consulting agreements, and intellectual property licensing agreements pursuant to which the Company is required to pay royalty fees. It is not possible to determine the amounts the Company will ultimately be required to pay under these agreements as they are subject to many variables including performance-based bonuses, severance arrangements, the Company's sales levels, and reductions in payment obligations if designated minimum performance criteria are not achieved. The amounts listed approximate minimum purchase obligations, base compensation, and guaranteed minimum royalty payments the Company is obligated to pay under these agreements. The actual amounts paid under some of these agreements may be higher or lower than the amounts included. In the aggregate, the actual amount paid under these obligations is likely to be higher than the amounts listed as a result of the variable nature of these obligations. In addition, the Company also enters into unconditional purchase obligations with various vendors and suppliers of goods and services in the normal course of operations through purchase orders or other documentation or that are undocumented except for an invoice. Such unconditional purchase obligations are generally outstanding for periods less than a year and are settled by cash payments upon delivery of goods and services and are not reflected in this line item.\n(8)Amount represents the current and non-current portions of uncertain income tax positions as recorded on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. Amounts exclude uncertain income tax positions that the Company would be able to offset against deferred taxes. For further discussion, see Note 13 Income Taxes\u201d in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\n(9)Amount represents other long-term liabilities included on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020, primarily related to government deferrals of $2.3 million allowed under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ( CARES Act\u201d) in the United States. Amount also includes the future minimum payments under finance leases of $0.7 million, of which $0.3 million were recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and $0.4 million were recorded in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. For further discussion, see Note 3 \"Leases\" in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nDuring its normal course of business, the Company has made certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which it may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions. These include (i) intellectual property indemnities to the Company's customers and licensees in connection with the use, sale and/or license of Company products or trademarks, (ii) indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility leases for certain claims arising from such facilities or leases, (iii) indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to the goods or services provided to the Company or based on the negligence or willful misconduct of the Company, and (iv) indemnities involving the accuracy of representations and warranties in certain contracts. In addition, the Company has made contractual commitments to each of its officers and certain other employees providing for severance payments upon the termination of employment. The Company has also issued guarantees in the form of a standby letter of credit in the amount of $0.4 million as security for contingent liabilities under certain workers' compensation insurance policies.\nThe duration of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees varies, and in certain cases may be indefinite. The majority of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation on the maximum amount of future payments the Company could be obligated to make. Historically, costs incurred to settle claims related to indemnities have not been material to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, the\nCompany believes the likelihood is remote that payments under the commitments and guarantees described above will have a material effect on the Company's financial condition. The fair value of indemnities, commitments and guarantees that the Company issued during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was not material to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn addition to the contractual obligations listed above, the Company's liquidity could also be adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome with respect to claims and litigation that the Company is subject to from time to time.

This increase was primarily due to incremental sales of outdoor apparel, gear and accessories as a result of the acquisition of Jack Wolfskin in January 2019, combined with the continued success of the TravisMathew apparel business. This increase in TravisMathew sales resulted from brand momentum, an increase in their wholesale business and an increase in direct-to-consumer sales due in part to the opening of five new retail stores in 2019 and six new retail stores in 2018. Net sales of apparel were negatively impacted by $12.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations period over period.\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As Reported </td> <td> </td> <td>Non-Cash Amortization of Intangible Assets(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Acquisition and Transition Costs(5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Non-GAAP </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) attributable to Callaway Golf Company </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>79.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(13.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(12.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>105.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted earnings (loss) per share </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.82 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.15) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.13) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted-average shares outstanding </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company currently estimates that it will issue approximately 90 million shares of its common stock to the stockholders of Topgolf (excluding the Company) for 100% of the outstanding equity of Topgolf, using an exchange ratio based on an equity value of Topgolf of approximately $1,986.0 million (or approximately $1,745.0 million excluding Topgolf shares currently held by the Company) and a price per share of the Company's common stock fixed at $19.40 per share. The actual purchase consideration upon the close of the Merger will be based on the estimated number of shares of the Company's common stock as discussed above, multiplied by the closing price of Company's common stock as of that day. As of December 31, 2020, the Company held approximately 14.3% of Topgolf's outstanding shares, which will be contributed towards that total purchase consideration. The Company will also recognize a gain, which is expected to be in excess of $200.0 million to write-up its pre-merger investment in Topgolf to its fair value, based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of the Merger. Upon completion of the Merger, the former Topgolf stockholders (other than the Company) are expected to own approximately 48.5% of the combined company on a fully diluted basis. Outstanding Topgolf stock options will be converted into options to purchase the Company's common stock, generally using the same exchange ratio. Additionally, the Company currently expects to acquire significant deferred tax assets related to tax carryforwards in the Proposed Merger. As a result of the propose merger it is possible a significant amount of the combined Company's deferred tax assets could expire unused and therefore the Company may be required to record a valuation allowance against all or a substantial portion of its net deferred tax assets, which could have a significant impact on the Company's tax provision in 2021. The analysis of this is complex and is subject to judgment based on information not yet available to the Company. The Company will make a more complete assessment of this following the merger and will record a valuation allowance, if appropriate.\nSegment Profitability\nOverview of Business, Seasonality and Foreign Currency\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Growth </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Dollars </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Golf Equipment </td> <td>$ </td> <td>979.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>912.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Apparel, Gear and Other </td> <td>721.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>329.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>392.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>118.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,701.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,242.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>458.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's cost of sales is comprised primarily of material and component costs, distribution and warehousing costs, and overhead. Historically, over 85% of the Company's manufacturing costs, primarily material and component costs, are variable in nature and fluctuate with sales volumes. With respect to the Company's Golf Equipment operating segment, variable costs as a percentage of cost of sales range between 85% to 95% for golf club products and 70% to 80% for golf ball products. Variable costs for soft goods in the Apparel, Gear and Other operating segment are generally greater than 85% as fewer fixed costs are used in the manufacturing of soft goods products. Generally, the relative significance of the components of cost of sales does not vary materially from these percentages from period to period. See \"Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019-Segment Profitability\" and \"Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018-Segment Profitability\" below for further discussion of gross margins.\nIn October 2020, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire Topgolf in an all-stock transaction, pursuant to a Merger Agreement by and among the Company, Topgolf and the Merger Sub. The Merger is expected to close during the first quarter of 2021, after which the former Topgolf stockholders (other than the Company) are expected to own approximately 48.5% of the combined company on a fully diluted basis. This Merger is expected to enable the combined company to accelerate innovation, develop exciting new products and experiences, and create compelling value for shareholders.\nGross profit decreased $109.2 million to $657.6 million in 2020 from $766.8 million in 2019. Gross profit as a percent of net sales (\"gross margin\") decreased 370 basis points to 41.4% in 2020 from 45.1% in 2019. The decline in gross profit was primarily due to the overall decline in sales related to the COVID-19 pandemic, proactive soft goods inventory reduction initiatives, costs associated with idle facilities during the government mandated shutdown and increased freight expense in the back-half of 2020. These declines were partially offset by favorable changes in foreign currency as well as a higher mix of e-commerce sales, which have higher gross margins. For a further discussion of gross margin, see \"Segment Profitability\" below.\n(1)Reconciling items represent corporate general and administrative expenses and other income (expense) not included by management in determining segment profitability. The $67.8 million increase in reconciling items in 2019 compared to 2018 includes incremental corporate general and administrative expenses associated with the addition of the Jack Wolfskin business in January 2019, in addition to $34.1 million in non-recurring charges that include (i) transition costs associated with the acquisition of Jack Wolfskin, (ii) the amortization of intangible assets and the cost impact associated with a change in valuation of inventory (inventory step-up) related to the Company's Jack Wolfskin acquisition, and (iii) amortization charges of intangible assets related to the Company's OGIO and TravisMathew acquisitions. Reconciling items in 2019 also include incremental interest expense of $31.7 million related to the Term Loan Facility used for the Jack Wolfskin acquisition as well as $3.9 million of net foreign currency exchange losses associated with the Jack Wolfskin acquisition. In 2018, reconciling items include $7.3 million of net foreign currency exchange gains, and $3.7 million of transaction costs associated with the Jack Wolfskin acquisition.

The Company is required to file federal and state income tax returns in the United States and various other income tax returns in foreign jurisdictions. The preparation of these income tax returns requires the Company to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions, which could affect the amount of tax paid by the Company. The Company accrues an amount for its estimate of additional tax liability, including interest and penalties in income tax expense, for any uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. The Company reviews and updates the accrual for uncertain tax positions as more definitive information becomes available. Historically, additional taxes paid as a result of the resolution of the Company's uncertain tax positions have not been materially different from the Company's expectations.

The increased non-GAAP earnings in 2019 is primarily due to the new Jack Wolfskin business combined with growth in the TravisMathew business, the success of the golf equipment product lines launched in 2019, in addition to a lower tax rate, partially offset by a $33.8 million increase in interest expense primarily as a result of the new Term Loan Facility to fund the purchase of Jack Wolfskin.\n \nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Decline </td> <td> </td> <td>Constant Currency\nDecline vs. 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollars </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States </td> <td>$ </td> <td>778.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>788.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.2) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.2)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe </td> <td>373.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>428.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(55.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.0) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(14.7)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Japan </td> <td>212.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>246.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(34.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.9) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(15.6)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rest of World </td> <td>225.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>238.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.1) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.8)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,589.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,701.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(111.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.6) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.2)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue Recognition\nOn a non-GAAP basis, excluding the items described in the table following this paragraph, the Company's net income and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2020 would have been $64.4 million and $0.67 per share, respectively, compared to $105.7 million and $1.10 per share, respectively, for the comparative period in 2019. The decrease in non-GAAP earnings in 2020 was primarily due to the business disruptions and challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020, which resulted in a significant decline in net sales and operating income compared to 2019, partially offset by the Company's planned cost reduction initiatives in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as decreased travel and entertainment expenses, lower variable expenses due to lower sales, and reduced spending in marketing and tour expenses. In addition, non-GAAP net income for 2020 includes a net gain that was recognized in connection with the settlement of a cross-currency swap contract as well as the favorable impact of changes in foreign currencies. All the foregoing was offset by the Company's continued investments in its new businesses.\nFinancial Condition\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Growth </td> <td> </td> <td>Constant Currency Growth/(Decline) vs. 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Dollars </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States </td> <td>$ </td> <td>788.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>708.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>11.3% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe </td> <td>428.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>149.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>279.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>186.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>201.9% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Japan </td> <td>246.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>223.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.9% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rest of World </td> <td>238.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>161.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>54.6% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,701.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,242.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>458.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>39.4% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales of Golf Balls decreased $15.3 million (7.3%) to $195.6 million in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to a decline in sales volume and flat average selling prices. The decline in sales volume was due to the business disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic during the first half of 2020, including the delayed launch of the Chrome Soft X golf balls, which occurred later in the second quarter of 2020 than originally anticipated. This decline was partially offset by an increase in sales in the third and fourth quarters due to the popularity of golf as a socially-distanced activity.\nInformation regarding recent accounting pronouncements is contained in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by this reference.\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Payments Due By Period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term Loan Facility(1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>441.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>417.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on Term Loan Facility </td> <td>106.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Japan Term Loan Facility(2)\n</td> <td>18.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on Japan Term Loan Facility </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Convertible Notes(3)\n</td> <td>258.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>258.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equipment Notes(4)\n</td> <td>31.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on equipment notes </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant Improvements(5)\n</td> <td>3.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on tenant improvements </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ABL Facility </td> <td>22.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases, including imputed interest(6)\n</td> <td>268.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>115.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unconditional purchase obligations(7)\n</td> <td>61.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Uncertain tax contingencies(8)\n</td> <td>6.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long term liabilities(9)\n</td> <td>6.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,231.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>134.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>176.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>114.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>805.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n \nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually or more frequently whenever indicators are present that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable. To determine fair value, the Company uses cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate rate, quoted market prices, royalty rates when available and independent appraisals as appropriate. Any required impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the asset and a charge to earnings. The Company uses its best judgment based on current facts and circumstances related to its business when making these estimates. However, if actual results are not consistent with the Company's estimates and assumptions used in calculating future cash flows and asset fair values, the Company may be exposed to losses that could be material.\nCapital Resources\nOperating Segments Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $5.4 million to $150.7 million (9.5% of net sales) in 2020 compared to $145.3 million (8.5% of net sales) in 2019. This 3.7% increase was primarily due to a $10.9 million increase in legal expenses and professional fees, and a $2.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense. These increases were partially offset by a $6.5 million decline in employee costs as a result of the Company's cost reduction initiatives in response to COVID-19, and a $2.1 million decline in travel expenses due to COVID-19 travel restrictions.\n\nThe Company does not currently have any material commitments for capital expenditures.\n\n \nNet sales in the United States decreased $9.6 million (1.2%) to $778.6 million during 2020 compared to $788.2 million in 2019. Net sales in regions outside of the United States decreased $102.0 million (11.2%) to $810.9 million in 2020 compared to $912.9 million in 2019. Fluctuations in foreign currencies had a favorable impact on international net sales of $10.8 million in 2020 relative to the prior year. The general decrease in net sales by region was primarily due to the business disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as discussed above, partially offset by increased sales of golf equipment resulting from the popularity of golf as a social-distancing activity. The significant decline in Europe was primarily due to a decline in sales of soft goods in that region as the result of the temporary closure of retail stores during the second quarter of 2020, and again, to a lesser extent in the fourth quarter of 2020. The decline in Japan was due to a region specific product launch in 2019 and no similar launch in 2020, combined with a slower recovery of their apparel business, which was more heavily impacted by the pandemic.\nNet sales of Golf Balls increased $15.3 million (7.8%) to $210.9 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the successful launch of the new ERC and Chrome Soft X Triple Track and Supersoft lines of golf balls in 2019, combined with the continued success of the 2018 Truvis and Chrome Soft golf balls, which resulted in an overall increase in market share period over period. Net sales of golf balls were negatively impacted by $2.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations period over period.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements, the related notes and the section Important Notice to Investors Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d that appear elsewhere in this report.\nThe Company has no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\ndue to the seasonal nature of the Jack Wolfskin business, as many of its products are geared toward the fall/winter season. The Company's inventories decreased to $352.5 million as of December 31, 2020 from $456.6 million as of December 31, 2019. This $104.1 million decrease was primarily due to the Company's working capital management, including the Company's proactive soft goods inventory reduction initiatives, combined with an increase in demand for golf equipment as the result of the increased popularity of golf in the current COVID-19 environment. Inventories as a percentage of trailing 12 months net sales decreased to 22.0% as of December 31, 2020 compared to 27.9% as of December 31, 2019.\nCurrent income tax expense or benefit is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable or receivable for the current year. A deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability computed pursuant to ASC Topic 740 and its reported amount in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively. In accordance with the applicable accounting rules, the Company maintains a valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset when it is deemed to be more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating whether a valuation allowance is required under such rules, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including prior operating results, the nature and reason for any losses, its forecast of future taxable income, and the dates on which any deferred tax assets are expected to expire. These assumptions require a significant amount of judgment, including estimates of future taxable income. These estimates are based on the Company's best judgment at the time made based on current and projected circumstances and conditions. For further information, see Note 13 Income Taxes\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n(6)The Company leases certain warehouse, distribution and office facilities, vehicles and office equipment under operating leases. The amounts presented in this line item represent commitments for minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases. At December 31, 2020, short-term and long-term operating lease liabilities of $29.6 million and $178.0 million, respectively, were recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. For further discussion, see Note 3 \"Leases\" in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nOperating and Reportable Segments\nSales of the Company's golf and lifestyle apparel, gear and accessories generally follow the same seasonality as golf equipment, and are therefore generally higher during the first half of the year. Sales of outdoor apparel, footwear and equipment related to the Jack Wolfskin business focuses primarily on outerwear and consequently experiences stronger sales for such products during the cold-weather months and the corresponding prior sell-in periods. Therefore, sales of Jack Wolfskin products are generally greater during the second half of the year.\nNet sales information for the Golf Equipment segment by product category is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\nForeign Currency\nGolf Equipment sales increased $66.3 million (7.3%) to $979.2 million in 2019 compared to $912.9 million in 2018 as a result of increases of $51.0 million or 7.1% in golf club sales and $15.3 million or 7.8% in golf ball sales. Net sales for Golf Equipment in 2019 reflect $11.6 million of unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency rates.\nApparel, Gear and Other\nNet sales of Gear, Accessories & Other increased $93.5 million (42.9%) to $311.2 million in 2019 compared to 2018. This increase was primarily due to the addition of Jack Wolfskin, combined with an increase in sales of Callaway-branded golf gloves. Net sales of gear, accessories and other were negatively impacted by $7.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations period over period.\n(7)During the normal course of its business, the Company enters into agreements to purchase goods and services, including purchase commitments for production materials, endorsement agreements with professional golfers and other endorsers, employment and consulting agreements, and intellectual property licensing agreements pursuant to which the Company is required to pay royalty fees. It is not possible to determine the amounts the Company will ultimately be required to pay under these agreements as they are subject to many variables including performance-based bonuses, severance arrangements, the Company's sales levels, and reductions in payment obligations if designated minimum performance criteria are not achieved. The amounts listed approximate minimum purchase obligations, base compensation, and guaranteed minimum royalty payments the Company is obligated to pay under these agreements. The actual amounts paid under some of these agreements may be higher or lower than the amounts included. In the aggregate, the actual amount paid under these obligations is likely to be higher than the amounts listed as a result of the variable nature of these obligations. In addition, the Company also enters into unconditional purchase obligations with various vendors and suppliers of goods and services in the normal course of operations through purchase orders or other documentation or that are undocumented except for an invoice. Such unconditional purchase obligations are generally outstanding for periods less than a year and are settled by cash payments upon delivery of goods and services and are not reflected in this line item.\nFor further discussion of each operating segment's results, see \"Operating Segments Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\" below.\nThe Company also offers short-term sales program incentives, which include sell-through promotions and price concessions or price reductions. Sell-through promotions are generally offered throughout the product's life cycle, which varies from two to three years, and price concessions or price reductions are generally offered at the end of the product's life cycle. The estimated variable consideration related to these programs is based on a rate that includes historical and forecasted data. The Company records a reduction to net sales using this rate at the time of the sale. The Company monitors this rate against actual results and forecasted estimates and adjusts the rate as deemed necessary in order to reflect the amount of consideration it expects to receive from its customers. There were no material changes to the rate during the year ended December 31, 2020, and the Company's actual amount of variable consideration related to these sales programs has historically not been materially different from its estimates. However, if the actual variable consideration is significantly different than the accrued estimates, the Company may be exposed to adjustments to revenue that could be material. Assuming there had been a 10% increase over the accrued estimated variable consideration for 2020 sales program incentives, pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2020 would have decreased by approximately $2.5 million.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n(1)Reconciling items represent corporate general and administrative expenses and other income (expense) not included by management in determining segment profitability. The $156.8 million increase in reconciling items in 2020 compared to 2019 includes the recognition of a $174.3 million impairment charge to write down goodwill and a portion of the trade name related to Jack Wolfskin in 2020 (see Note 9 \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets\" to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K), $5.5 million in expenses related to the Company's transition to its new North America distribution center in 2020, and an $8.1 million increase in net interest expense. These increases were partially offset by a $23.4 million increase in other income primarily due to foreign currency and hedging contract gains, and a $10.9 million decrease in amortization expense recognized in 2019 related to the inventory valuation step-up from the Jack Wolfskin acquisition (see Note 6 \"Business Combinations\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).\nThe Company's ability to generate sufficient positive cash flows from operations is subject to many risks and uncertainties, including future economic trends and conditions, the future economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for the Company's products, foreign currency exchange rates, as well as the Company's pending merger with Topgolf, which was announced in October 2020, in addition to other risks and uncertainties applicable to the Company and its business (see Risk Factors\u201d contained in Part I, Item 1A in this Form 10-K). Given the uncertain duration of the COVID-19-related impact, the Company has proactively taken actions to significantly reduce costs, maximize liquidity and conserve cash for as long as may be required in light of current conditions. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company achieved significant planned reductions in operating expenses and capital expenditures by reducing discretionary spending and infrastructure costs on a worldwide basis, which included reductions in workforce, marketing and travel expenses, as well as voluntary reductions in compensation by the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer and other members of senior management. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $632.2 million in cash and availability under its credit facilities, which is an increase of $329.1 million compared to December 31, 2019. Information about the Company's credit facilities and long-term borrowings is presented in Note 7 Financing Arrangements\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K, and is incorporated herein by this reference.\n\"Financing Arrangements\" and Note 19 \"Derivatives and Hedging\" to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $111.6 million (6.6%) to $1,589.5 million compared to $1,701.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease reflects a $115.1 million or 15.9% decline in sales of apparel, gear and other resulting from the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the temporary closure of most of the Company's operations and retail doors during the second quarter of 2020, with additional closures in the fourth quarter of 2020. This decrease was partially offset by the golf equipment segment, which saw strong momentum during the second half of the year and resulted in a $3.5 million or 0.4% increase in sales of golf equipment. In addition, due to government mandated restrictions and retail store closures, the Company experienced a higher mix of e-commerce sales, which increased overall by 34.5% in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in net sales also reflects the favorable impact of $10.8 million due to fluctuations in foreign currencies for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe Company maintains an allowance for estimated credit losses resulting from the failure of its customers to make required payments. As of January 1, 2020, the Company accounts for these estimated losses in accordance with ASC Topic 326, \"Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\" which replaced the \"expected credit loss\" model with the \"incurred loss\" model and requires consideration of a broader range of information to estimate expected credit losses over the life of the asset. The Company's prior methodology for estimating credit losses on trade accounts receivable did not differ significantly from the new requirements of ASC 326. Specific allowance amounts are established to record the appropriate provision for customers that have a higher probability of default. An estimate of credit losses for the remaining customers in the aggregate is based upon historical bad debts, current customer receivable balances, age of customer receivable balances, and the customers' financial condition, all of which are subject to change. Additionally, the Company's monitoring activities now consider future reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions to adjust all general reserve percentages as necessary. Balances are written off when determined to be uncollectible. Assuming there had been a 10% increase in uncollectible accounts over the 2020 recorded estimated allowance for doubtful accounts, pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2020 would have decreased by approximately $1.7 million.\nApparel, Gear and Other sales decreased $115.1 million (15.9%) to $606.8 million in 2020 compared to $721.9 million in 2019 primarily due to the business disruptions and challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in e-commerce sales, which increased by approximately 56.0% in 2020 compared to 2019. Net sales information for the Apparel, Gear and Other segment is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\nThe Company is required to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, as well as the estimated useful life of those acquired intangible assets. Intangible assets may include the acquired company's trade name, existing customer relationships, developed technology, patents and goodwill. Significant estimates and assumptions used to value intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future revenues, growth rates, cash flows and discount rates. In addition, significant estimates and assumptions are used in determining uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances, as well as the fair value of equity awards assumed. The Company's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.\nNet sales in the United States increased $79.7 million (11.2%) to $788.2 million during 2019 compared to $708.5 million in 2018. Net sales in regions outside of the United States increased $378.6 million (70.9%) to $912.9 million in 2019 compared to $534.3 million in 2018. Fluctuations in foreign currencies had an unfavorable impact on international net sales of $31.2 million in 2019 relative to the prior year. The increase in net sales by region includes the following:\n(1)Represents non-recurring transaction fees, including banker's fees, legal fees, consulting and travel, and transition costs, including consulting, audit fees and valuations services associated with the acquisition of Jack Wolfskin completed in January 2019, as well as other non-recurring advisory fees. In addition, 2019 includes a net loss and 2018 includes a net gain due to the remeasurement of a foreign currency forward contract to mitigate the risk of foreign currency fluctuations on the acquisition of Jack Wolfskin.\nsecured by certain equipment at this facility. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had an aggregate of $31.8 million outstanding under these notes. The Equipment Notes have maturity dates between December 2022 and March 2027. For further discussion, see Note 7 \"Financing Arrangements\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nA significant portion of the Company's business is conducted outside of the United States in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign currency rates can have a significant effect on the Company's financial results. The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency rates. While these foreign currency forward contracts can mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency rates, they do not eliminate those effects, which can be significant. These effects include (i) the translation of results denominated in foreign currency into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, (ii) the mark-to-market adjustments of certain intercompany balance sheet accounts denominated in foreign currencies and (iii) the mark-to-market adjustments of the Company's foreign currency forward contracts. In general, the Company's overall financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which the Company conducts its business.\nNet income in 2019 decreased 24.2% to $79.4 million compared to $104.7 million in 2018. Diluted earnings per share decreased to $0.82 in 2019 compared to $1.08 in 2018. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding after-tax acquisition related costs as well as certain hedging losses associated with the purchase price of Jack Wolfskin, and excluding after-tax purchase accounting amortization expenses related to the Jack Wolfskin, TravisMathew and OGIO acquisitions, the Company's net income and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2019 would have been $105.7 million and $1.10\n \nSelling expenses increased by $129.5 million to $438.2 million (25.8% of net sales) in 2019 compared to $308.7 million (24.8% of net sales) in 2018. This increase reflects $114.4 million of incremental costs resulting from the addition of the Jack Wolfskin business, a $5.9 million increase in employee costs, and a $3.8 million increase in professional fees as a result of additional investments in the business to sustain the Company's growth.\nPre-tax income in the Company's Apparel, Gear and Other operating segment decreased to $0.7 million in 2020 from $75.5 million in 2019. This decrease was primarily due to a $86.9 million decrease in gross profit (a decline of 540 basis points in gross margin), partially offset by a $12.1 million decrease in operating expenses. The decline in gross margin was\nThe Company's net sales by operating segment are presented below (dollars in millions):\nThe Company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products when it satisfies the terms of a sales order from a customer, and transfers control of the products ordered to the customer. Control transfers at a point in time when products are shipped, and in certain cases, when products are received by customers. In addition, the Company recognizes revenue at the point of sale on transactions with consumers at its retail locations. The Company receives a royalty from the licensing of its trademarks and service marks to third parties for certain apparel, gear and golf accessories. Royalty income is recognized over time in net sales as underlying product sales occur, subject to certain minimum royalties, in accordance with the related licensing arrangements and is included in the Company's Apparel, Gear and Other operating segment. Revenues from gift cards are deferred and recognized when the cards are redeemed. The Company's gift cards have no expiration date. The Company recognizes revenue from unredeemed gift cards, otherwise known as breakage, when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote and under circumstances that comply with any applicable state escheatment laws.\n \nResults of Operations\nGross profit increased $188.4 million to $766.8 million in 2019 from $578.4 million in 2018. Gross profit as a percent of net sales (\"gross margin\") decreased 140 basis points to 45.1% in 2019 from 46.5% in 2018. This decrease was primarily due to amortization charges of $10.9 million related to a fair value adjustment to Jack Wolfskin's inventory recorded as part of the Company's purchase price allocation, which resulted in a negative impact to gross margin of 60 basis points. The remaining decrease in margin of 80 basis points was due to a shift in current year product mix in the golf equipment segment to sales of more premium products, which generally have lower margins due to more advanced technology, combined with the negative impact of increased tariff expense and unfavorable changes in foreign currency rates. These decreases were partially offset by sales growth from the Company's TravisMathew business, which is accretive to gross margin. For a further discussion of gross margin, see \"Segment Profitability\" below.\nThe Apparel, Gear and Other operating segment includes the Jack Wolfskin outdoor apparel, gear and accessories business, the TravisMathew golf and lifestyle apparel and accessories business, and the Callaway soft goods business and the OGIO business, which consists of golf apparel and accessories (including golf bags and gloves), storage gear for sport and personal use, and royalties from licensing of the Company's trademarks and service marks for various soft goods products.\nInventories\nProfitability by operating segment is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\nThe Company's inventory balance fluctuates throughout the year as a result of the general seasonality of the Company's business and is also affected by the timing of new product launches. With respect to the Company's Golf Equipment business, the buildup of inventory levels generally begins during the fourth quarter and continues heavily into the first quarter as well as into the beginning of the second quarter in order to meet demand during the height of the golf season. Inventory levels are also impacted by the timing of new product launches as well as the success of new products. Apparel, Gear and Other inventory levels start to build in the second quarter and continues into the third and fourth quarters\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to transactions of its international subsidiaries. As part of its strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company uses designated cash flow hedges and non-designated hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency translation on transactions that are denominated primarily in Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Euros, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars and Korean Won, and designated interest rate hedge contracts to mitigate the impact of variable interest rates on long-term debt.\nThe Company's discussion and analysis of its results of operations, financial condition and liquidity are based upon the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"). The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, shareholders' equity, sales and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an ongoing basis, the Company reviews its estimates to ensure that the estimates appropriately reflect changes in its business and new information as it becomes available.\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2018, certain financial results exclude non-cash amortization expense of intangible assets associated with the OGIO and TravisMathew acquisitions.\nThe Company has included in this report information to reconcile this non-GAAP information to the most directly comparable GAAP information. The non-GAAP information presented in this report should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any measure derived in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP information may also be inconsistent with the manner in which similar measures are derived or used by other companies. Management uses such non-GAAP information for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period over period comparisons of the underlying performance of its business and in forecasting the Company's business going forward. Management believes that the presentation of such non-GAAP information, when considered in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP information, provides additional useful comparative information for investors in their assessment of the underlying performance of the Company's business.\nFor further discussion of each operating segment's results, see \"Operating Segments Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\" below.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 50% of the Company's cash was held in regions outside of the United States. Due to changes enacted by the Tax Act in December 2017, incremental U.S. federal income tax is no longer a consideration if the Company were to repatriate cash to the United States outside of settling intercompany balances. However, if the Company were to repatriate such cash, it may need to pay incremental foreign withholding taxes which, subject to certain limitations, generate foreign tax credits for use against the Company's U.S. tax liability, if any. Additionally, the Company may need to pay certain state income taxes. The Company continues to maintain its indefinite reinvestment assertion with respect to most jurisdictions in which it operates because of local cash requirements to operate its business.\n(3)In May 2020, the Company issued $258.8 million of 2.75% Convertible Notes, which mature on May 1, 2026 unless earlier redeemed or repurchased by the Company or converted. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $183.1 million outstanding under the Convertible Notes, net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $5.5 million and debt discount of $70.1 million, as presented on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. The Convertible Notes will mature on May 1, 2026. For further discussion, see Note 7 \"Financing Arrangements\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\n\nNet income/loss in 2020 decreased to a net loss of $126.9 million compared to net income of $79.4 million in 2019. Diluted earnings/loss per share decreased $2.17 to a loss per share of $1.35 in 2020 compared to earnings per share of $0.82 in 2019.\nThe Company's net sales by operating segment are presented below (dollars in millions):\n\u2022In the United States, the increase was primarily due to an increase in sales of golf equipment combined with an increase in apparel sales due to the continued growth of the Travis Mathew business.\nPre-tax income in the Company's Golf Equipment operating segment improved to $140.3 million in 2019 from $128.6 million in 2018. This improvement was primarily due to a $13.3 million increase in gross profit as a result of the increase in net sales as discussed above, partially offset by a decline in gross margin due to a more premium mix of products sold in 2019 compared to 2018, which generally have lower margins due to the higher cost of more advanced technology, in addition to the recognition of higher golf ball manufacturing costs in 2019 associated with the complexity of managing production while completing major capital improvements on the golf ball manufacturing facility. The increase in gross profit was offset by a $1.6 million increase in operating expenses primarily to support the revenue growth period over period, combined with the negative impact from unfavorable changes in foreign currency rates.\nIn most of the regions where the Company conducts business, the game of golf is played primarily on a seasonal basis. Weather conditions generally restrict golf from being played year-round, except in a few markets, with many of the Company's on-course customers closing for the cold weather months. The Company's golf equipment business is therefore subject to seasonal fluctuations. In general, during the first quarter, the Company begins selling its golf club and golf ball products into the golf retail channel for the new golf season. This initial sell-in generally continues into the second quarter. Second-quarter sales are significantly affected by the amount of reorder business of the products sold during the first quarter. Third-quarter sales are generally dependent on reorder business but can also include smaller new product launches, typically resulting in lower sales than the second quarter as many retailers begin decreasing their inventory levels in anticipation of the end of the golf season. Fourth-quarter sales are generally less than the other quarters due to the end of the golf season in many of the Company's key regions. However, third-quarter sales can be affected by a mid-year product launch, and fourth-quarter sales can be affected from time to time by the early launch of product introductions related to the new golf season of the subsequent year. This seasonality, and therefore quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, can be affected by many factors, including the timing of new product introductions as well as weather conditions. In general, because of this seasonality, a majority of the Company's sales from its Golf Equipment operating segment and most, if not all, of its profitability from this segment generally occurs during the first half of the year.\nInformation about the Company's share repurchases during 2020 is presented in Part II, Item 5 in this Form 10-K under the heading \"Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers,\" which is incorporated herein by this reference.\n(5)In connection with lease of the Company's North American distribution Center, the Company financed certain building improvements of $3.8 million, of which $0.2 million was recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and $3.6 million was recorded in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. This financing arrangement is due in February 2035.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, due to the significant disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's operations, the Company performed a qualitative assessment considering the macroeconomic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the potential impact on the Company's sales and operating income for the remainder of fiscal 2020 and potentially beyond. Based on this assessment, the Company determined that there were indicators of impairment, and proceeded with a quantitative assessment of goodwill for all reporting units as well as for its indefinite-lived intangible assets. As a result, the Company recognized impairment losses of $148.4 million to write-off the goodwill associated with the Jack Wolfskin reporting unit, and $25.9 million to write-down the trade name associated with Jack Wolfskin to its new estimated fair value. The Company did not record further impairments in the second half of 2020. For further information, see Note 9 Goodwill and Intangible Assets\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nThe duration of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees varies, and in certain cases may be indefinite. The majority of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation on the maximum amount of future payments the Company could be obligated to make. Historically, costs incurred to settle claims related to indemnities have not been material to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, the\n\nCompany believes the likelihood is remote that payments under the commitments and guarantees described above will have a material effect on the Company's financial condition. The fair value of indemnities, commitments and guarantees that the Company issued during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was not material to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n(5)Represents non-recurring transaction fees associated with the Jack Wolfskin acquisition completed in January 2019, including banker's fees, legal fees, consulting and travel expenses; costs associated with transitioning and reporting on the Jack Wolfskin business, including audit fees for SEC reporting requirements, recruiting fees, and valuation services associated with preparing Jack Wolfskin's opening balance sheet; consulting fees to address an activist investor; and a net loss from the remeasurement of a foreign currency forward contract in connection with the acquisition of Jack Wolfskin, which was denominated in Euros.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2020, certain financial results exclude certain non-cash charges, including the recognition of an impairment loss to write-off goodwill and a portion of the trade name associated with Jack Wolfskin, amortization expense of intangible assets associated with the Jack Wolfskin, OGIO and TravisMathew acquisitions, amortization expense related to the discount of the Convertible Notes issued in May 2020, costs associated with the pending Topgolf merger, and other non-recurring expenses.\nThe amount of revenue the Company recognizes is based on the amount of consideration it expects to receive from customers. The amount of consideration is the sales price adjusted for estimates of variable consideration, including sales returns, discounts and allowances as well as sales programs, sales promotions and price concessions that are offered by the Company as described below. These estimates are based on the amounts earned or expected to be claimed by customers on the related sales, and are therefore recorded as reductions to sales and trade accounts receivable.\n(8)Amount represents the current and non-current portions of uncertain income tax positions as recorded on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. Amounts exclude uncertain income tax positions that the Company would be able to offset against deferred taxes. For further discussion, see Note 13 Income Taxes\u201d in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\n\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $458.3 million (36.9%) to $1,701.1 million compared to $1,242.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to the Company's acquisition of the outdoor apparel, gear and accessories company, Jack Wolfskin, which added incremental sales of $356.2 million to the Company's Apparel, Gear and Other operating segment. Excluding this acquisition, net sales increased $102.0 million (8.2%) for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, primarily due to a 7.3% increase in the Golf Equipment segment as well as the continued success of the TravisMathew apparel business. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 would have been $31.2 million higher using average foreign exchange rates in effect in 2018.\nended December 31, 2019 includes the amortization of the inventory valuation step-up in connection with the Jack Wolfskin acquisition.\n\u2022In Europe, the increase was primarily due to incremental apparel sales resulting from the Jack Wolfskin acquisition completed in January 2019, combined with an increase in sales of golf equipment, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations on sales.\n\u2022The increase in Rest of World was primarily driven by incremental apparel sales in China resulting from the Jack Wolfskin acquisition completed in January 2019, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations on sales.\nSeasonality\n(2)Represents the amortization of intangible assets related to the Company's OGIO and TravisMathew acquisitions in January 2017 and August 2017, respectively, as well as the amortization of intangible assets and the cost impact associated with a change in valuation of inventory (inventory step-up) related to the Company's Jack Wolfskin acquisition in January 2019.\n(1)In January 2019, to fund the purchase price of the Jack Wolfskin acquisition, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement which provided for a Term Loan Facility in an aggregate principal of $480.0 million, which was issued less $9.6 million in original issue discount and other transaction fees. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $441.6 million outstanding under the Term Loan Facility, which is offset by unamortized debt issuance costs of $13.5 million as presented on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. The Term Loan Facility is due in January 2026. For further discussion, see Note 7 \"Financing Arrangements\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nApparel, Gear and Other\nPre-tax income in the Company's Golf Equipment operating segment improved to $148.6 million in 2020 from $140.3 million in 2019. This improvement was primarily due to a $36.0 million decrease in operating expenses, partially offset by a $27.7 million decline in gross profit (a decline of 300 basis points in gross margin). The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to decreases in marketing expenses and employee costs resulting from the Company's cost reduction initiatives in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to decreases in employee travel costs and tour expense resulting from travel restrictions and canceled golf tournaments caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The decline in gross margin was largely due to lower sales and the negative impact of idle facilities during the government mandated shutdown during the first half of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and increased freight expense in the back-half of 2020. This decline was partially offset by a higher mix of direct-to-consumer e-commerce sales, which have higher margins relative the Company's wholesale business.\nNet sales for the full year in 2020 decreased $111.6 million or 6.6% to $1,589.5 million compared to $1,701.1million in 2019. This decrease reflects a $115.1 million or 15.9% decline in net sales of apparel, gear and other, offset by an increase of $3.5 million or 0.4% in net sales of golf equipment, compared to 2019. The overall decline in net sales in 2020 reflects the challenges the Company faced as the result of the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily during the first half of 2020 at the height of the worldwide regulatory restrictions, which resulted in the temporary closure of the Company's retail locations, manufacturing facilities and distribution centers at varying times. The Company began to see signs of improvement coming out of the second quarter of 2020, and in the third and fourth quarters of 2020, the Company experienced record sales due to an unprecedented demand for golf equipment, particularly in the United States and Europe, due to an increased interest in the game of golf, as it supports an active and healthy way of life that is compatible with social distancing. This surge in golf equipment sales also reflects the strength of the Company's product offerings across all skill levels. Additionally, although sales of apparel, gear and other were down substantially for the full year, these soft goods sales rebounded faster than anticipated during the second half of the year, led by the TravisMathew and Jack Wolfskin apparel businesses, which have benefited from strong brand momentum combined with increased outdoor consumer activity. In addition, as government mandated restrictions and retail store closures limited consumers' ability to shop in-store, the Company experienced a higher mix of e-commerce sales in 2020, which increased overall by 34.5%\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $44.8 million to $145.3 million (8.5% of net sales) in 2019 compared to $100.5 million (8.1% of net sales) in 2018. This increase was primarily due to $30.1 million of incremental costs resulting from the addition of the Jack Wolfskin business, in addition to increases of $10.6 million in transaction and transition costs related to the Jack Wolfskin acquisition combined with expense from the purchase accounting amortization of intangible assets, and $3.6 million in legal expense.\n\nIn addition to the contractual obligations listed above, the Company's liquidity could also be adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome with respect to claims and litigation that the Company is subject to from time to time. See Note 14 Commitments & Contingencies\u201d in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nBusiness and Products\nsegment of the market compared to the premium Epic Flash line of fairway woods launched in 2019. Net sales of golf clubs were negatively impacted by $9.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations period over period.\n\n \nGolf Equipment\nDue to the significant business disruption and macro-economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $174.3 million to write-off goodwill and a portion of the trade name associated with Jack Wolfskin. For further discussion, see Note 9 \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets\" to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nThe provision for income taxes decreased by $9.5 million to $16.5 million in 2019, compared to $26.0 million in 2018 primarily due to the decline in pre-tax income. As a percentage of pre-tax income, the Company's effective tax rate during 2019 declined to 17.3% compared to 19.8% in 2018 primarily due to a shift in the mix of foreign earnings relative to the prior year. For further discussion, see Note 13 \"Income Taxes\" to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of the Company's results under GAAP for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 to the Company's non-GAAP results as defined above for the same periods (in millions, except per share information).\nThe provision for income taxes decreased by $17.0 million to a tax benefit of $0.5 million in 2020, compared to a tax provision of $16.5 million in 2019. The Company's effective tax rate as a percentage of pre-tax loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased to 0.4%, compared to 17.3% as a percent of pre-tax income in the comparable period of 2019. This decrease was primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge recorded during the second quarter of 2020, which is non-deductible for tax purposes combined with an overall decline in pre-tax earnings in 2020 compared to 2019. For further discussion, see Note 13 \"Income Taxes\" to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nThe Golf Equipment operating segment, which is comprised of golf club and golf ball products, includes Callaway Golf-branded woods, hybrids, irons, wedges, Odyssey putters, including Toulon Design putters by Odyssey, packaged sets, Callaway Golf and Strata branded golf balls and sales of pre-owned golf clubs.\nLooking forward, the Company anticipates that COVID-19 will continue to negatively impact its business in 2021 as a result of the continued government shutdown orders and other restrictions around the world, although to a lesser degree than in 2020. All of the Company's business segments, as well as the Topgolf business, support an active outdoor lifestyle that is compatible with a world of social distancing and the Company anticipates that its continued brand momentum, increased demand for golf equipment and recovery in its soft goods business will continue into 2021, and therefore help mitigate the impact of COVID-19.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nProfitability by operating segment is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\nThe Company's primary sales program, the Preferred Retailer Program,\u201d offers potential rebates and discounts for participating retailers in exchange for providing certain benefits to the Company, including the maintenance of agreed upon inventory levels, prime product placement and retailer staff training. Under this program, qualifying retailers can earn either discounts or rebates based upon the amount of product purchased. Discounts are applied and recorded at the time of sale. For rebates, the Company estimates the amount of variable consideration related to the rebate at the time of sale based on the customer's estimated qualifying current year product purchases. The estimate is based on the historical level of purchases, adjusted for any factors expected to affect the current year purchase levels. The estimated year-end rebate is adjusted quarterly based on actual purchase levels, as necessary. The Preferred Retailer Program is generally short-term in nature and the actual amount of rebate to be paid under this program is known as of the end of the year and paid to customers shortly after year-end. Historically, the Company's actual amount of variable consideration related to its Preferred Retailer Program has not been materially different from its estimates.\nprimarily due to the Company's proactive soft goods inventory reduction initiatives combined with the negative impact of idle facilities during the government mandated shutdown, fixed costs on the lower sales base caused by the temporary shut-down of the Company's distribution centers and retail locations primarily during the first half of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These declines were partially offset by a higher mix of direct to consumer e-commerce sales, which have higher gross margins relative to the Company's wholesale business. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to decreases in marketing expenses and employee costs resulting from the Company's cost reduction initiatives in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to a decrease in employee travel costs as the result of travel restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOther income increased by $23.4 million to $25.0 million in 2020 compared to $1.6 million in 2019. This increase was due to a $14.8 million increase in net foreign currency transaction gains, combined with the recognition of an $11.0 million net gain in connection with the settlement of a cross-currency swap contract. These increases were partially offset by a net decrease of $4.0 million on gains related to hedging contracts.\nGolf Equipment sales increased $3.5 million (0.4%) to $982.7 million in 2020 compared to $979.2 million in 2019 as a result of an increase of $18.8 million or 2.4% in golf club sales, partially offset by a $15.3 million or 7.2% decrease in golf ball sales. Net sales information for the Golf Equipment segment by product category is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nApparel, Gear and Other\nPre-tax income in the Company's Apparel, Gear and Other operating segment increased to $75.5 million in 2019 from $54.9 million in 2018 primarily due to the addition of the Jack Wolfskin business in January 2019, combined with an improvement in gross margin as a result of the continued success of the TravisMathew apparel business, partially offset by the negative impact of unfavorable changes in foreign currency rates.\nThe Company records an estimate for anticipated returns as a reduction of sales and cost of sales, and accounts receivable in the period that the related sales are recorded. The cost recovery of inventory associated with this reserve is accounted for in other current assets. Sales returns are estimated based upon historical returns, current economic trends, changes in customer demands and sell-through of products. The Company also offers certain customers sales programs that allow for specific returns. The Company records a return reserve for anticipated returns related to these sales programs at the time of the sale based on the terms of the sales program. Historically, the Company's actual sales returns have not been materially different from management's original estimates. The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the allowance for sales returns. However, if the actual costs of sales returns are significantly different than the recorded estimated allowance, the Company may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. Assuming there had been a 10% increase over the recorded estimated allowance for 2020 sales returns less the cost recovery of inventory, pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2020 would have decreased by approximately $4.4 million.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe following table summarizes certain significant cash obligations as of December 31, 2020 that will affect the Company's future liquidity (in millions):\nSegment Profitability\n(3)Represents transaction costs related to the Topgolf merger announced in October 2020, including legal, professional and SEC filing fees, redundant costs associated with the Company's transition of its North America distribution center to a new facility, IT consulting related to the implementation of new IT systems for Jack Wolfskin, and severance charges associated with workforce reductions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nShare Repurchases\n\u2022The increase in Japan was primarily due to an increase in sales of golf equipment.\n\u2022For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, certain of the Company's financial results were presented on a constant currency basis, which estimates what the Company's financial results would have been without changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This information is calculated by taking the current period local currency results and translating them into U.S. dollars based upon the foreign currency exchange rates for the applicable comparable prior period.\nDuring its normal course of business, the Company has made certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which it may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions. These include (i) intellectual property indemnities to the Company's customers and licensees in connection with the use, sale and/or license of Company products or trademarks, (ii) indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility leases for certain claims arising from such facilities or leases, (iii) indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to the goods or services provided to the Company or based on the negligence or willful misconduct of the Company, and (iv) indemnities involving the accuracy of representations and warranties in certain contracts. In addition, the Company has made contractual commitments to each of its officers and certain other employees providing for severance payments upon the termination of employment. The Company has also issued guarantees in the form of a standby letter of credit in the amount of $0.4 million as security for contingent liabilities under certain workers' compensation insurance policies.\nIn connection with the pending Merger with Topgolf discussed above, the Company will reassess its operating and reportable segments at the time the Merger becomes final.\nThe Company has two operating and reportable segments, namely Golf Equipment and Apparel, Gear and Other.\nCOVID-19 also negatively impacted the Company's gross margin. More specifically, the Company's 2020 full year gross margin compared to 2019 declined 370 basis points primarily due to the decrease in sales, the shutdown of its manufacturing plants during the year and the Company's proactive inventory reduction initiatives. To mitigate the effects of COVID-19 on the Company's business, the Company took proactive actions to protect its employees, reduce costs, maximize liquidity, and conserve cash. Reductions in discretionary spending and infrastructure costs, including a reduction in workforce, reduced marketing and travel expenses, and voluntary reductions in compensation by the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer and other members of senior management, have resulted in a significant reduction in planned operating expenses and capital expenditures. As a result of these cost reduction initiatives, the Company realized net savings in operating expenses of $45.3 million (7.1%) (excluding impairment charges of $174.3 million) for the full year in 2020 compared to 2019.\n(9)Amount represents other long-term liabilities included on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020, primarily related to government deferrals of $2.3 million allowed under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ( CARES Act\u201d) in the United States. Amount also includes the future minimum payments under finance leases of $0.7 million, of which $0.3 million were recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and $0.4 million were recorded in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. For further discussion, see Note 3 \"Leases\" in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\n(2)Represents the non-cash amortization of the discount on the Convertible Notes issued in May 2020.\n(4)Total diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis for the year ended December 31, 2020 was calculated using diluted weighted average shares outstanding, as earnings on a non-GAAP basis resulted in net income after giving effect to the non-recurring and non-cash charges discussed above.\n\n(1) In connection with the Company's assessment of its operating and reportable segments the Company also reassessed its reportable regions. As a result, starting on January 1, 2019, the Company began to report regional sales previously reported in rest of Asia and other foreign countries in rest of world. Accordingly, the prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation of regional sales.\nDiscussion of Non-GAAP Measures\nNet sales information for the Apparel, Gear and Other segment is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\nNet sales of Golf Clubs increased $51.0 million (7.1%) to $768.3 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to increases in sales of irons and putters, partially offset by a decline in sales of woods. Net sales of irons and wedges increased due to the successful launch of the Apex and Big Bertha premium lines of irons in 2019 in addition to the 2019 launch of the Epic Forged premium line of irons and MD5 Jaws wedges with no comparable models launched in 2018, combined with the continued success of the prior year Rogue line of irons and MD4 wedges. The increase in putter sales was due to the success of the new platform of Stroke Lab putters launched in 2019. Net sales of woods declined due to the wide success of the Rogue line of fairway woods in 2018, which was a larger core product launch targeted toward a larger\nAllowance for Estimated Credit Losses\nThe Company's cash and cash equivalents increased $259.5 million to $366.1 million at December 31, 2020, from $106.7 million at December 31, 2019, primarily due to proceeds of $258.8 million from the Convertible Notes issued in May 2020 combined with tight working capital management and the Company's cost reduction actions taken in response to COVID-19. This improvement in liquidity was partially offset by the overall decline in earnings period over period due to the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's business during 2020. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company used its cash and cash equivalents combined with the proceeds from the issuance of the Convertible Notes to fund its operations, repay $134.9 million of amounts outstanding under its credit and long-term debt facilities, fund capital expenditures of $39.3 million, primarily for the Company's transition of its North America distribution center to a new facility, investments in its golf ball manufacturing plant and for the implementation of new IT systems. The Company further invested $20.0 million in Topgolf, and repurchased shares of its common stock for $22.2 million. In addition, in connection with the Convertible Notes, the Company paid a premium of $31.8 million for capped call transactions, which are expected to generally reduce the potential dilution to the Company's common stock upon any conversion of the notes. Management expects to fund the Company's future operations from current cash balances and cash provided by its operating activities, combined with borrowings under its current and future credit facilities as well as from other available sources of capital, as deemed necessary. See Note 7 \"Financing Arrangements\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information on the Company's credit facilities, Term Loan Facility and Convertible Notes.\nNet sales of Gear, Accessories & Other decreased $53.7 million (17.3%) to $257.5 million in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to a decline in sales of OGIO-branded bags and Callaway-branded golf bags resulting from the business challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the Company moved a portion of the OGIO business to a licensing arrangement during the current year.\nGolf Equipment\nYears Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\n\n(4)In August 2020, the Company entered into two new long-term financing agreements in connection with the Company's investment initiatives at its North American distribution center in Fort Worth, Texas, and in addition, to improve its manufacturing capabilities at its golf ball manufacturing facility in Chicopee, Massachusetts, the Company entered into a series of long-term financing agreements (collectively, the \"Equipment Notes\") between 2017 and 2020 that are\nThe Company designs, manufactures and sells a full line of high quality golf equipment, including golf clubs and golf balls, and apparel, gear and other products. The Company designs its golf products to be technologically advanced and in this regard invests a considerable amount in research and development each year. The Company designs its golf products for golfers of all skill levels, both amateur and professional. In addition, the Company designs and develops a full line of high quality soft goods, including golf bags, apparel, footwear and other golf accessories. In 2017, the Company expanded its soft goods lines with the acquisitions of OGIO and TravisMathew. Under the OGIO brand, the Company offers a full line of premium personal storage gear for sport and personal use, a line of performance outerwear for men, and golf and apparel accessories. TravisMathew offers a full line of premium golf and lifestyle apparel as well as footwear and accessories. In January 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of JW Stargazer Holding GmbH, the owner of the international, premium outdoor apparel, gear and accessories brand, Jack Wolfskin. This acquisition further enhanced the Company's lifestyle category and provides a platform for future growth in the active outdoor and urban outdoor categories. The Company's soft goods under the Callaway, OGIO, TravisMathew and Jack Wolfskin brands are largely designed and developed internally.\nNet sales information by region is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\n\nThe Company accounts for its foreign currency forward contracts, cross-currency debt swap contracts and interest rate hedge contracts in accordance with ASC Topic 815, \"Derivatives and Hedging\" (\"ASC Topic 815\"). ASC Topic 815 requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet, the measurement of those instruments at fair value and the recognition of changes in the fair value of derivatives in earnings in the period of change, unless the derivative qualifies as a designated cash flow hedge that offsets certain exposures. Certain criteria must be satisfied in order for derivative financial instruments to be classified and accounted for as a cash flow hedge. Gains and losses from the remeasurement of qualifying cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and released into earnings as a component of cost of goods sold or net sales, other income (expense) and interest expense during the period in which the hedged transaction takes place. Remeasurement gains or losses of derivatives that are not elected for hedge accounting treatment are recorded in earnings immediately as a component of other income (expense).\nExecutive Summary of Results of Operations\nNet sales information by region is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\nNet sales of Apparel decreased $61.4 million (15.0%) to $349.3 million in 2020 compared to 2019 due to a decline in sales across all apparel brands as a result of the business challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the temporary closure of retail stores in most major markets, primarily during the second quarter of 2020, combined with additional closures during the fourth quarter of 2020.\nCost of Sales\nPending Merger with Topgolf\nInterest expense increased by $33.8 million to $39.3 million in 2019 compared to $5.5 million in 2018 primarily due to $31.7 million of incremental interest expense recognized from the Term Loan Facility and related debt issuance costs in connection with the Jack Wolfskin acquisition completed in January 2019 (see Note 6 \"Business Combinations\" and Note 7 \"Financing Arrangements\" to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).\n\nResearch and development expenses decreased by $4.3 million to $46.3 million (2.9% of net sales) in 2020 compared to $50.6 million (3.0% of net sales) in 2019. This 8.5% decrease was primarily due to a $4.1 million decline in employee costs resulting from the Company's cost reduction initiatives, and a $1.2 million decline in travel and entertainment as a result of travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nManagement believes the critical accounting policies discussed below affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. For a complete discussion of all of the Company's significant accounting policies, see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\ncompared to e-commerce sales in 2019. The Company anticipates this trend will continue into 2021. Overall, the Company is encouraged that sales in all of its businesses are improving since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOther income decreased by $6.2 million to $1.6 million in 2019 compared to $7.8 million in 2018 primarily due to the recognition of a net loss of $3.9 million from the remeasurement of a foreign currency forward contract that was put in place to mitigate the risk of foreign currency fluctuations on the acquisition of Jack Wolfskin, combined with a decline in net foreign currency gains from non-designated foreign currency hedging contracts, and an increase in net foreign currency transaction losses year over year.\nThe Company's principal sources of liquidity consist of its existing cash balances, including cash from the issuance of the Convertible Notes in May 2020, funds expected to be generated from operations and funds from its credit facilities. Based upon the Company's current cash balances, its estimates of funds expected to be generated from operations in 2021, as well as from current and projected availability under its current or future credit facilities, the Company believes that it will be able to finance current and planned operating requirements, capital expenditures, required debt repayments and contractual obligations and commercial commitments for at least the next 12 months from the issuance of this Form 10-K.\n(1)The Company changed its operating segments as of January 1, 2019. Accordingly, prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation.\n\nestimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory, pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2020 would have decreased by approximately $2.5 million.\n(1)Includes the non-cash amortization expense of intangible assets in connection with the acquisitions of Jack Wolfskin, TravisMathew and OGIO. In addition, the year ended December 31, 2020 includes the recognition of a $174.3 million impairment charge to write down goodwill and a portion of the trade name related to Jack Wolfskin, and the year\nIn addition to the financial results contained in this report, which have been prepared and presented in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, the Company has also included supplemental information concerning the Company's financial results on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP information includes the following:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nYears Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nIncome Taxes\nIn October 2020, the Company entered into a Merger Agreement to acquire Topgolf in an all-stock transaction (see Note 6 \"Business Combinations\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K). In connection with the Merger with Topgolf, the Company anticipates it will assume long-term debt, net of cash, of approximately $550.0 million to $600.0 million. The Company believes that with its continued strong cash generation and increased available liquidity on its debt facilities, its geographic diversity and the strength of its brands, it will be able to fund Topgolf's growth while simultaneously paying its other obligations.\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2019, certain financial results exclude certain non-cash charges, including the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments associated with the Jack Wolfskin acquisition, amortization expense of intangible assets associated with the Jack Wolfskin, OGIO and TravisMathew acquisitions, and transaction and transition costs in connection with the Jack Wolfskin acquisition.\nAfter COVID-19 began, the Company also focused on maximizing cash and liquidity, including the inventory reduction initiatives to generate cash and tight management of working capital generally, combined with the suspension of open market stock repurchases and the cessation of the Company's quarterly dividend. Due to these efforts to maximize cash and liquidity, reduced discretionary spending, and overall business improvement, at December 31, 2020, the Company's liquidity, consisting of cash, including proceeds from the convertible senior notes issued in May 2020, combined with availability under its credit facilities, increased to $632.4 million compared to $303.3 million at December 31, 2019.\non the acquisition of Jack Wolfskin and the Company's credit facilities and long-term debt obligations see Note 6 \"Business Combinations\" and Note 7 \"Financing Arrangements\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nSelling expenses decreased by $46.4 million to $391.8 million (24.7% of net sales) in 2020 compared to $438.2 million (25.8% of net sales) in 2019. This 10.6% decrease was primarily due to the Company's planned reduction in operating expenses in response to the decline in sales caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. These reductions consisted of a $23.6 million decline in marketing and tour expenses due to the cancellation of golf events, a $11.5 million decline in employee costs as a result of the Company's cost reduction initiatives in response to COVID-19, and a $8.3 million decline in employee travel expenses due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, as well as an overall decline in variable expenses.\nLiquidity\nThe Company's accounts receivable balance fluctuates throughout the year as a result of the general seasonality of the Company's business and is also affected by the timing of new product launches. With respect to the Company's Golf Equipment business, the accounts receivable balance will generally be at its highest during the first and second quarters due to the seasonal peak in the golf season, and it will generally decline significantly during the third and fourth quarters as a result of an increase in cash collections and lower sales. The Company's Apparel, Gear and Other accounts receivable balances are expected to be higher during the second half of the year due to the seasonal nature of the Jack Wolfskin business, with a significant portion of its products geared toward the fall/winter season. As of December 31, 2020, the Company's net accounts receivable decreased to $138.5 million from $140.5 million as of December 31, 2019. This $2.0 million decrease was primarily driven by an increase in the reserves for bad debt for certain slow-paying customers impacted by COVID-19, partially offset by an increase in trade receivables resulting from the overall increase in sales of both golf equipment and apparel during the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which includes a reserve for excess, obsolete and/or unmarketable inventory. The Company estimates the reserve based upon current inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience as well as management's estimates of market conditions and forecasts of future product demand, all of which are subject to change. The calculation of the Company's reserve for excess, obsolete and/or unmarketable inventory requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory aging, forecasted consumer demand and pricing, regulatory (USGA and R&A) rule changes, the promotional environment and technological obsolescence. The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the reserve. However, if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or change, the Company may need to increase its inventory allowance, which could significantly adversely affect the Company's operating results. Assuming there had been a 10% increase in obsolete or unmarketable inventory over the 2020 recorded\nNet sales of Golf Clubs increased $18.8 million (2.4%) to $787.1 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in sales volume, partially offset by a decline in average selling prices. The increase in sales volume was driven by an increase in the popularity of golf as a result of the heightened demand for outdoor, socially-distanced activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Also due to the pandemic, sales of golf equipment through the Company's e-commerce channel increased by approximately 24.0% in 2020 compared to 2019. The decline in average selling prices was primarily due to the current year launch of the Mavrik line of drivers and irons, which have a lower average selling price compared to the Epic Flash drivers and Apex irons launched in 2019, combined with a shift in sales mix to lower margin pre-owned products.\nThe Merger Agreement further provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, either party may be required to pay the other party a termination fee of $75.0 million. The Merger is expected to close on or around March 8, 2021, subject to shareholder approval and other customary conditions (see Note 6 Business Combinations\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).\nDerivatives and Hedging\nResearch and development expenses increased by $9.8 million to $50.6 million (3.0% of net sales) in 2019 compared to $40.8 million (3.3% of net sales) in 2018. This increase was primarily due to $9.3 million of incremental costs resulting from the addition of the Jack Wolfskin business.", "item_7_text": "Interest expense increased by $8.1 million to $47.4 million in 2020 compared to $39.3 million in 2019 primarily due to the issuance of $258.8 million in Convertible Notes in May 2020 partially offset by a decrease resulting from repayments on the Term Loan Facility and lower outstanding borrowings on the Company's credit facilities (see Note 7\nNet sales of Apparel increased $298.5 million (266.0%) to $410.7 million in 2019 compared to 2018. This increase was primarily due to incremental sales of outdoor apparel, gear and accessories as a result of the acquisition of Jack Wolfskin in January 2019, combined with the continued success of the TravisMathew apparel business. This increase in TravisMathew sales resulted from brand momentum, an increase in their wholesale business and an increase in direct-to-consumer sales due in part to the opening of five new retail stores in 2019 and six new retail stores in 2018. Net sales of apparel were negatively impacted by $12.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations period over period.\nThe Company currently estimates that it will issue approximately 90 million shares of its common stock to the stockholders of Topgolf (excluding the Company) for 100% of the outstanding equity of Topgolf, using an exchange ratio based on an equity value of Topgolf of approximately $1,986.0 million (or approximately $1,745.0 million excluding Topgolf shares currently held by the Company) and a price per share of the Company's common stock fixed at $19.40 per share. The actual purchase consideration upon the close of the Merger will be based on the estimated number of shares of the Company's common stock as discussed above, multiplied by the closing price of Company's common stock as of that day. As of December 31, 2020, the Company held approximately 14.3% of Topgolf's outstanding shares, which will be contributed towards that total purchase consideration. The Company will also recognize a gain, which is expected to be in excess of $200.0 million to write-up its pre-merger investment in Topgolf to its fair value, based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of the Merger. Upon completion of the Merger, the former Topgolf stockholders (other than the Company) are expected to own approximately 48.5% of the combined company on a fully diluted basis. Outstanding Topgolf stock options will be converted into options to purchase the Company's common stock, generally using the same exchange ratio. Additionally, the Company currently expects to acquire significant deferred tax assets related to tax carryforwards in the Proposed Merger. As a result of the propose merger it is possible a significant amount of the combined Company's deferred tax assets could expire unused and therefore the Company may be required to record a valuation allowance against all or a substantial portion of its net deferred tax assets, which could have a significant impact on the Company's tax provision in 2021. The analysis of this is complex and is subject to judgment based on information not yet available to the Company. The Company will make a more complete assessment of this following the merger and will record a valuation allowance, if appropriate.\nSegment Profitability\nOverview of Business, Seasonality and Foreign Currency\nThe Company's cost of sales is comprised primarily of material and component costs, distribution and warehousing costs, and overhead. Historically, over 85% of the Company's manufacturing costs, primarily material and component costs, are variable in nature and fluctuate with sales volumes. With respect to the Company's Golf Equipment operating segment, variable costs as a percentage of cost of sales range between 85% to 95% for golf club products and 70% to 80% for golf ball products. Variable costs for soft goods in the Apparel, Gear and Other operating segment are generally greater than 85% as fewer fixed costs are used in the manufacturing of soft goods products. Generally, the relative significance of the components of cost of sales does not vary materially from these percentages from period to period. See \"Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019-Segment Profitability\" and \"Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018-Segment Profitability\" below for further discussion of gross margins.\nIn October 2020, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire Topgolf in an all-stock transaction, pursuant to a Merger Agreement by and among the Company, Topgolf and the Merger Sub. The Merger is expected to close during the first quarter of 2021, after which the former Topgolf stockholders (other than the Company) are expected to own approximately 48.5% of the combined company on a fully diluted basis. This Merger is expected to enable the combined company to accelerate innovation, develop exciting new products and experiences, and create compelling value for shareholders.\nGross profit decreased $109.2 million to $657.6 million in 2020 from $766.8 million in 2019. Gross profit as a percent of net sales (\"gross margin\") decreased 370 basis points to 41.4% in 2020 from 45.1% in 2019. The decline in gross profit was primarily due to the overall decline in sales related to the COVID-19 pandemic, proactive soft goods inventory reduction initiatives, costs associated with idle facilities during the government mandated shutdown and increased freight expense in the back-half of 2020. These declines were partially offset by favorable changes in foreign currency as well as a higher mix of e-commerce sales, which have higher gross margins. For a further discussion of gross margin, see \"Segment Profitability\" below.\n(1)Reconciling items represent corporate general and administrative expenses and other income (expense) not included by management in determining segment profitability. The $67.8 million increase in reconciling items in 2019 compared to 2018 includes incremental corporate general and administrative expenses associated with the addition of the Jack Wolfskin business in January 2019, in addition to $34.1 million in non-recurring charges that include (i) transition costs associated with the acquisition of Jack Wolfskin, (ii) the amortization of intangible assets and the cost impact associated with a change in valuation of inventory (inventory step-up) related to the Company's Jack Wolfskin acquisition, and (iii) amortization charges of intangible assets related to the Company's OGIO and TravisMathew acquisitions. Reconciling items in 2019 also include incremental interest expense of $31.7 million related to the Term Loan Facility used for the Jack Wolfskin acquisition as well as $3.9 million of net foreign currency exchange losses associated with the Jack Wolfskin acquisition. In 2018, reconciling items include $7.3 million of net foreign currency exchange gains, and $3.7 million of transaction costs associated with the Jack Wolfskin acquisition. For information\nForeign currency forward contracts and interest rate hedge contracts are used only to meet the Company's objectives of minimizing variability in the Company's operating results arising from foreign exchange rate movements and changes in interest rates. The Company does not enter into foreign currency forward contracts, cross-currency debt swap contracts and interest rate hedge contracts for speculative purposes. The Company utilizes counterparties for its derivative instruments that it believes are credit-worthy at the time the transactions are entered into and the Company closely monitors the credit ratings of these counterparties.\nGolf Equipment\nThe Company accounts for revenue recognition in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 606, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\" See Note 2 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" and Note 4 Revenue Recognition\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\n \nPursuant to ASC Topic 740-25-6, the Company is required to accrue for the estimated additional amount of taxes for uncertain tax positions if it is deemed to be more likely than not that the Company would be required to pay such additional taxes. The Company is required to file federal and state income tax returns in the United States and various other income tax returns in foreign jurisdictions. The preparation of these income tax returns requires the Company to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions, which could affect the amount of tax paid by the Company. The Company accrues an amount for its estimate of additional tax liability, including interest and penalties in income tax expense, for any uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. The Company reviews and updates the accrual for uncertain tax positions as more definitive information becomes available. Historically, additional taxes paid as a result of the resolution of the Company's uncertain tax positions have not been materially different from the Company's expectations. The Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. For further information, see Note 13 Income Taxes.\u201d\n\nOther Significant Cash and Contractual Obligations\nIn order to permit the consummation of the Merger with Topgolf, in October 2020, the Company also amended its ABL and Term Loan facilities. The ABL Facility amendment designates Topgolf and its subsidiaries as excluded subsidiaries under the ABL Facility and amends certain covenants and other provisions to allow the Company to make certain investments in, and enter into certain transactions with Topgolf, among other things. The amendment to the Term Loan Facility permits the consummation of the Merger with Topgolf and certain other transactions contemplated in the Merger Agreement.\n(2)In August 2020, the Company entered into the Japan Term Loan Facility for $2,000.0 million Yen (or approximately U.S. $19.4 million using the exchange rate in effect as of December 31, 2020). The Company had $1,900.0 million Yen (or approximately U.S. $18.4 million using the exchange rate in effect as of December 31, 2020) outstanding under the Japan Term Loan Facility on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. The Japan Term Loan Facility is due in August 2025. For further discussion, see Note 7 \"Financing Arrangements\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of the Company's results under GAAP for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 to the Company's non-GAAP results as defined above for the same periods (in millions, except per share information).\n\nOperating Segments Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nper share compared to $104.9 million and $1.08 per share for the comparative period in 2018. The increased non-GAAP earnings in 2019 is primarily due to the new Jack Wolfskin business combined with growth in the TravisMathew business, the success of the golf equipment product lines launched in 2019, in addition to a lower tax rate, partially offset by a $33.8 million increase in interest expense primarily as a result of the new Term Loan Facility to fund the purchase of Jack Wolfskin.\n \nRevenue Recognition\nOn a non-GAAP basis, excluding the items described in the table following this paragraph, the Company's net income and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2020 would have been $64.4 million and $0.67 per share, respectively, compared to $105.7 million and $1.10 per share, respectively, for the comparative period in 2019. The decrease in non-GAAP earnings in 2020 was primarily due to the business disruptions and challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020, which resulted in a significant decline in net sales and operating income compared to 2019, partially offset by the Company's planned cost reduction initiatives in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as decreased travel and entertainment expenses, lower variable expenses due to lower sales, and reduced spending in marketing and tour expenses. In addition, non-GAAP net income for 2020 includes a net gain that was recognized in connection with the settlement of a cross-currency swap contract as well as the favorable impact of changes in foreign currencies. All the foregoing was offset by the Company's continued investments in its new businesses.\nFinancial Condition\nNet sales of Golf Balls decreased $15.3 million (7.3%) to $195.6 million in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to a decline in sales volume and flat average selling prices. The decline in sales volume was due to the business disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic during the first half of 2020, including the delayed launch of the Chrome Soft X golf balls, which occurred later in the second quarter of 2020 than originally anticipated. This decline was partially offset by an increase in sales in the third and fourth quarters due to the popularity of golf as a socially-distanced activity.\nInformation regarding recent accounting pronouncements is contained in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by this reference.\n \nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually or more frequently whenever indicators are present that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable. To determine fair value, the Company uses cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate rate, quoted market prices, royalty rates when available and independent appraisals as appropriate. Any required impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the asset and a charge to earnings. The Company uses its best judgment based on current facts and circumstances related to its business when making these estimates. However, if actual results are not consistent with the Company's estimates and assumptions used in calculating future cash flows and asset fair values, the Company may be exposed to losses that could be material.\nCapital Resources\nOperating Segments Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $5.4 million to $150.7 million (9.5% of net sales) in 2020 compared to $145.3 million (8.5% of net sales) in 2019. This 3.7% increase was primarily due to a $10.9 million increase in legal expenses and professional fees, and a $2.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense. These increases were partially offset by a $6.5 million decline in employee costs as a result of the Company's cost reduction initiatives in response to COVID-19, and a $2.1 million decline in travel expenses due to COVID-19 travel restrictions.\n\nThe Company does not currently have any material commitments for capital expenditures.\n\n \nNet sales in the United States decreased $9.6 million (1.2%) to $778.6 million during 2020 compared to $788.2 million in 2019. Net sales in regions outside of the United States decreased $102.0 million (11.2%) to $810.9 million in 2020 compared to $912.9 million in 2019. Fluctuations in foreign currencies had a favorable impact on international net sales of $10.8 million in 2020 relative to the prior year. The general decrease in net sales by region was primarily due to the business disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as discussed above, partially offset by increased sales of golf equipment resulting from the popularity of golf as a social-distancing activity. The significant decline in Europe was primarily due to a decline in sales of soft goods in that region as the result of the temporary closure of retail stores during the second quarter of 2020, and again, to a lesser extent in the fourth quarter of 2020. The decline in Japan was due to a region specific product launch in 2019 and no similar launch in 2020, combined with a slower recovery of their apparel business, which was more heavily impacted by the pandemic.\nNet sales of Golf Balls increased $15.3 million (7.8%) to $210.9 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the successful launch of the new ERC and Chrome Soft X Triple Track and Supersoft lines of golf balls in 2019, combined with the continued success of the 2018 Truvis and Chrome Soft golf balls, which resulted in an overall increase in market share period over period. Net sales of golf balls were negatively impacted by $2.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations period over period.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements, the related notes and the section Important Notice to Investors Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d that appear elsewhere in this report.\nThe Company has no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\ndue to the seasonal nature of the Jack Wolfskin business, as many of its products are geared toward the fall/winter season. The Company's inventories decreased to $352.5 million as of December 31, 2020 from $456.6 million as of December 31, 2019. This $104.1 million decrease was primarily due to the Company's working capital management, including the Company's proactive soft goods inventory reduction initiatives, combined with an increase in demand for golf equipment as the result of the increased popularity of golf in the current COVID-19 environment. Inventories as a percentage of trailing 12 months net sales decreased to 22.0% as of December 31, 2020 compared to 27.9% as of December 31, 2019.\nCurrent income tax expense or benefit is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable or receivable for the current year. A deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability computed pursuant to ASC Topic 740 and its reported amount in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively. In accordance with the applicable accounting rules, the Company maintains a valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset when it is deemed to be more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating whether a valuation allowance is required under such rules, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including prior operating results, the nature and reason for any losses, its forecast of future taxable income, and the dates on which any deferred tax assets are expected to expire. These assumptions require a significant amount of judgment, including estimates of future taxable income. These estimates are based on the Company's best judgment at the time made based on current and projected circumstances and conditions. For further information, see Note 13 Income Taxes\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n(6)The Company leases certain warehouse, distribution and office facilities, vehicles and office equipment under operating leases. The amounts presented in this line item represent commitments for minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases. At December 31, 2020, short-term and long-term operating lease liabilities of $29.6 million and $178.0 million, respectively, were recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. For further discussion, see Note 3 \"Leases\" in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nOperating and Reportable Segments\nSales of the Company's golf and lifestyle apparel, gear and accessories generally follow the same seasonality as golf equipment, and are therefore generally higher during the first half of the year. Sales of outdoor apparel, footwear and equipment related to the Jack Wolfskin business focuses primarily on outerwear and consequently experiences stronger sales for such products during the cold-weather months and the corresponding prior sell-in periods. Therefore, sales of Jack Wolfskin products are generally greater during the second half of the year.\nNet sales information for the Golf Equipment segment by product category is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\nForeign Currency\nGolf Equipment sales increased $66.3 million (7.3%) to $979.2 million in 2019 compared to $912.9 million in 2018 as a result of increases of $51.0 million or 7.1% in golf club sales and $15.3 million or 7.8% in golf ball sales. Net sales for Golf Equipment in 2019 reflect $11.6 million of unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency rates.\nApparel, Gear and Other\nNet sales of Gear, Accessories & Other increased $93.5 million (42.9%) to $311.2 million in 2019 compared to 2018. This increase was primarily due to the addition of Jack Wolfskin, combined with an increase in sales of Callaway-branded golf gloves. Net sales of gear, accessories and other were negatively impacted by $7.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations period over period.\n(7)During the normal course of its business, the Company enters into agreements to purchase goods and services, including purchase commitments for production materials, endorsement agreements with professional golfers and other endorsers, employment and consulting agreements, and intellectual property licensing agreements pursuant to which the Company is required to pay royalty fees. It is not possible to determine the amounts the Company will ultimately be required to pay under these agreements as they are subject to many variables including performance-based bonuses, severance arrangements, the Company's sales levels, and reductions in payment obligations if designated minimum performance criteria are not achieved. The amounts listed approximate minimum purchase obligations, base compensation, and guaranteed minimum royalty payments the Company is obligated to pay under these agreements. The actual amounts paid under some of these agreements may be higher or lower than the amounts included. In the aggregate, the actual amount paid under these obligations is likely to be higher than the amounts listed as a result of the variable nature of these obligations. In addition, the Company also enters into unconditional purchase obligations with various vendors and suppliers of goods and services in the normal course of operations through purchase orders or other documentation or that are undocumented except for an invoice. Such unconditional purchase obligations are generally outstanding for periods less than a year and are settled by cash payments upon delivery of goods and services and are not reflected in this line item.\nFor further discussion of each operating segment's results, see \"Operating Segments Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\" below.\nThe Company also offers short-term sales program incentives, which include sell-through promotions and price concessions or price reductions. Sell-through promotions are generally offered throughout the product's life cycle, which varies from two to three years, and price concessions or price reductions are generally offered at the end of the product's life cycle. The estimated variable consideration related to these programs is based on a rate that includes historical and forecasted data. The Company records a reduction to net sales using this rate at the time of the sale. The Company monitors this rate against actual results and forecasted estimates and adjusts the rate as deemed necessary in order to reflect the amount of consideration it expects to receive from its customers. There were no material changes to the rate during the year ended December 31, 2020, and the Company's actual amount of variable consideration related to these sales programs has historically not been materially different from its estimates. However, if the actual variable consideration is significantly different than the accrued estimates, the Company may be exposed to adjustments to revenue that could be material. Assuming there had been a 10% increase over the accrued estimated variable consideration for 2020 sales program incentives, pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2020 would have decreased by approximately $2.5 million.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n(1)Reconciling items represent corporate general and administrative expenses and other income (expense) not included by management in determining segment profitability. The $156.8 million increase in reconciling items in 2020 compared to 2019 includes the recognition of a $174.3 million impairment charge to write down goodwill and a portion of the trade name related to Jack Wolfskin in 2020 (see Note 9 \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets\" to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K), $5.5 million in expenses related to the Company's transition to its new North America distribution center in 2020, and an $8.1 million increase in net interest expense. These increases were partially offset by a $23.4 million increase in other income primarily due to foreign currency and hedging contract gains, and a $10.9 million decrease in amortization expense recognized in 2019 related to the inventory valuation step-up from the Jack Wolfskin acquisition (see Note 6 \"Business Combinations\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).\nThe Company's ability to generate sufficient positive cash flows from operations is subject to many risks and uncertainties, including future economic trends and conditions, the future economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for the Company's products, foreign currency exchange rates, as well as the Company's pending merger with Topgolf, which was announced in October 2020, in addition to other risks and uncertainties applicable to the Company and its business (see Risk Factors\u201d contained in Part I, Item 1A in this Form 10-K). Given the uncertain duration of the COVID-19-related impact, the Company has proactively taken actions to significantly reduce costs, maximize liquidity and conserve cash for as long as may be required in light of current conditions. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company achieved significant planned reductions in operating expenses and capital expenditures by reducing discretionary spending and infrastructure costs on a worldwide basis, which included reductions in workforce, marketing and travel expenses, as well as voluntary reductions in compensation by the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer and other members of senior management. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $632.2 million in cash and availability under its credit facilities, which is an increase of $329.1 million compared to December 31, 2019. Information about the Company's credit facilities and long-term borrowings is presented in Note 7 Financing Arrangements\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K, and is incorporated herein by this reference.\n\"Financing Arrangements\" and Note 19 \"Derivatives and Hedging\" to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $111.6 million (6.6%) to $1,589.5 million compared to $1,701.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease reflects a $115.1 million or 15.9% decline in sales of apparel, gear and other resulting from the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the temporary closure of most of the Company's operations and retail doors during the second quarter of 2020, with additional closures in the fourth quarter of 2020. This decrease was partially offset by the golf equipment segment, which saw strong momentum during the second half of the year and resulted in a $3.5 million or 0.4% increase in sales of golf equipment. In addition, due to government mandated restrictions and retail store closures, the Company experienced a higher mix of e-commerce sales, which increased overall by 34.5% in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in net sales also reflects the favorable impact of $10.8 million due to fluctuations in foreign currencies for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe Company maintains an allowance for estimated credit losses resulting from the failure of its customers to make required payments. As of January 1, 2020, the Company accounts for these estimated losses in accordance with ASC Topic 326, \"Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\" which replaced the \"expected credit loss\" model with the \"incurred loss\" model and requires consideration of a broader range of information to estimate expected credit losses over the life of the asset. The Company's prior methodology for estimating credit losses on trade accounts receivable did not differ significantly from the new requirements of ASC 326. Specific allowance amounts are established to record the appropriate provision for customers that have a higher probability of default. An estimate of credit losses for the remaining customers in the aggregate is based upon historical bad debts, current customer receivable balances, age of customer receivable balances, and the customers' financial condition, all of which are subject to change. Additionally, the Company's monitoring activities now consider future reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions to adjust all general reserve percentages as necessary. Balances are written off when determined to be uncollectible. Assuming there had been a 10% increase in uncollectible accounts over the 2020 recorded estimated allowance for doubtful accounts, pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2020 would have decreased by approximately $1.7 million.\nApparel, Gear and Other sales decreased $115.1 million (15.9%) to $606.8 million in 2020 compared to $721.9 million in 2019 primarily due to the business disruptions and challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in e-commerce sales, which increased by approximately 56.0% in 2020 compared to 2019. Net sales information for the Apparel, Gear and Other segment is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\nThe Company is required to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, as well as the estimated useful life of those acquired intangible assets. Intangible assets may include the acquired company's trade name, existing customer relationships, developed technology, patents and goodwill. Significant estimates and assumptions used to value intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future revenues, growth rates, cash flows and discount rates. In addition, significant estimates and assumptions are used in determining uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances, as well as the fair value of equity awards assumed. The Company's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.\nNet sales in the United States increased $79.7 million (11.2%) to $788.2 million during 2019 compared to $708.5 million in 2018. Net sales in regions outside of the United States increased $378.6 million (70.9%) to $912.9 million in 2019 compared to $534.3 million in 2018. Fluctuations in foreign currencies had an unfavorable impact on international net sales of $31.2 million in 2019 relative to the prior year. The increase in net sales by region includes the following:\n(1)Represents non-recurring transaction fees, including banker's fees, legal fees, consulting and travel, and transition costs, including consulting, audit fees and valuations services associated with the acquisition of Jack Wolfskin completed in January 2019, as well as other non-recurring advisory fees. In addition, 2019 includes a net loss and 2018 includes a net gain due to the remeasurement of a foreign currency forward contract to mitigate the risk of foreign currency fluctuations on the acquisition of Jack Wolfskin.\nsecured by certain equipment at this facility. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had an aggregate of $31.8 million outstanding under these notes. The Equipment Notes have maturity dates between December 2022 and March 2027. For further discussion, see Note 7 \"Financing Arrangements\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nA significant portion of the Company's business is conducted outside of the United States in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign currency rates can have a significant effect on the Company's financial results. The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency rates. While these foreign currency forward contracts can mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency rates, they do not eliminate those effects, which can be significant. These effects include (i) the translation of results denominated in foreign currency into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, (ii) the mark-to-market adjustments of certain intercompany balance sheet accounts denominated in foreign currencies and (iii) the mark-to-market adjustments of the Company's foreign currency forward contracts. In general, the Company's overall financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which the Company conducts its business.\nNet income in 2019 decreased 24.2% to $79.4 million compared to $104.7 million in 2018. Diluted earnings per share decreased to $0.82 in 2019 compared to $1.08 in 2018. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding after-tax acquisition related costs as well as certain hedging losses associated with the purchase price of Jack Wolfskin, and excluding after-tax purchase accounting amortization expenses related to the Jack Wolfskin, TravisMathew and OGIO acquisitions, the Company's net income and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2019 would have been $105.7 million and $1.10\n \nSelling expenses increased by $129.5 million to $438.2 million (25.8% of net sales) in 2019 compared to $308.7 million (24.8% of net sales) in 2018. This increase reflects $114.4 million of incremental costs resulting from the addition of the Jack Wolfskin business, a $5.9 million increase in employee costs, and a $3.8 million increase in professional fees as a result of additional investments in the business to sustain the Company's growth.\nPre-tax income in the Company's Apparel, Gear and Other operating segment decreased to $0.7 million in 2020 from $75.5 million in 2019. This decrease was primarily due to a $86.9 million decrease in gross profit (a decline of 540 basis points in gross margin), partially offset by a $12.1 million decrease in operating expenses. The decline in gross margin was\nThe Company's net sales by operating segment are presented below (dollars in millions):\nThe Company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products when it satisfies the terms of a sales order from a customer, and transfers control of the products ordered to the customer. Control transfers at a point in time when products are shipped, and in certain cases, when products are received by customers. In addition, the Company recognizes revenue at the point of sale on transactions with consumers at its retail locations. The Company receives a royalty from the licensing of its trademarks and service marks to third parties for certain apparel, gear and golf accessories. Royalty income is recognized over time in net sales as underlying product sales occur, subject to certain minimum royalties, in accordance with the related licensing arrangements and is included in the Company's Apparel, Gear and Other operating segment. Revenues from gift cards are deferred and recognized when the cards are redeemed. The Company's gift cards have no expiration date. The Company recognizes revenue from unredeemed gift cards, otherwise known as breakage, when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote and under circumstances that comply with any applicable state escheatment laws.\n \nResults of Operations\nGross profit increased $188.4 million to $766.8 million in 2019 from $578.4 million in 2018. Gross profit as a percent of net sales (\"gross margin\") decreased 140 basis points to 45.1% in 2019 from 46.5% in 2018. This decrease was primarily due to amortization charges of $10.9 million related to a fair value adjustment to Jack Wolfskin's inventory recorded as part of the Company's purchase price allocation, which resulted in a negative impact to gross margin of 60 basis points. The remaining decrease in margin of 80 basis points was due to a shift in current year product mix in the golf equipment segment to sales of more premium products, which generally have lower margins due to more advanced technology, combined with the negative impact of increased tariff expense and unfavorable changes in foreign currency rates. These decreases were partially offset by sales growth from the Company's TravisMathew business, which is accretive to gross margin. For a further discussion of gross margin, see \"Segment Profitability\" below.\nThe Apparel, Gear and Other operating segment includes the Jack Wolfskin outdoor apparel, gear and accessories business, the TravisMathew golf and lifestyle apparel and accessories business, and the Callaway soft goods business and the OGIO business, which consists of golf apparel and accessories (including golf bags and gloves), storage gear for sport and personal use, and royalties from licensing of the Company's trademarks and service marks for various soft goods products.\nInventories\nProfitability by operating segment is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\nThe Company's inventory balance fluctuates throughout the year as a result of the general seasonality of the Company's business and is also affected by the timing of new product launches. With respect to the Company's Golf Equipment business, the buildup of inventory levels generally begins during the fourth quarter and continues heavily into the first quarter as well as into the beginning of the second quarter in order to meet demand during the height of the golf season. Inventory levels are also impacted by the timing of new product launches as well as the success of new products. Apparel, Gear and Other inventory levels start to build in the second quarter and continues into the third and fourth quarters\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to transactions of its international subsidiaries. As part of its strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company uses designated cash flow hedges and non-designated hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency translation on transactions that are denominated primarily in Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Euros, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars and Korean Won, and designated interest rate hedge contracts to mitigate the impact of variable interest rates on long-term debt.\nThe Company's discussion and analysis of its results of operations, financial condition and liquidity are based upon the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"). The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, shareholders' equity, sales and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an ongoing basis, the Company reviews its estimates to ensure that the estimates appropriately reflect changes in its business and new information as it becomes available.\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2018, certain financial results exclude non-cash amortization expense of intangible assets associated with the OGIO and TravisMathew acquisitions.\nThe Company has included in this report information to reconcile this non-GAAP information to the most directly comparable GAAP information. The non-GAAP information presented in this report should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any measure derived in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP information may also be inconsistent with the manner in which similar measures are derived or used by other companies. Management uses such non-GAAP information for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period over period comparisons of the underlying performance of its business and in forecasting the Company's business going forward. Management believes that the presentation of such non-GAAP information, when considered in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP information, provides additional useful comparative information for investors in their assessment of the underlying performance of the Company's business.\nFor further discussion of each operating segment's results, see \"Operating Segments Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\" below.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 50% of the Company's cash was held in regions outside of the United States. Due to changes enacted by the Tax Act in December 2017, incremental U.S. federal income tax is no longer a consideration if the Company were to repatriate cash to the United States outside of settling intercompany balances. However, if the Company were to repatriate such cash, it may need to pay incremental foreign withholding taxes which, subject to certain limitations, generate foreign tax credits for use against the Company's U.S. tax liability, if any. Additionally, the Company may need to pay certain state income taxes. The Company continues to maintain its indefinite reinvestment assertion with respect to most jurisdictions in which it operates because of local cash requirements to operate its business.\n(3)In May 2020, the Company issued $258.8 million of 2.75% Convertible Notes, which mature on May 1, 2026 unless earlier redeemed or repurchased by the Company or converted. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $183.1 million outstanding under the Convertible Notes, net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $5.5 million and debt discount of $70.1 million, as presented on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. The Convertible Notes will mature on May 1, 2026. For further discussion, see Note 7 \"Financing Arrangements\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\n\nNet income/loss in 2020 decreased to a net loss of $126.9 million compared to net income of $79.4 million in 2019. Diluted earnings/loss per share decreased $2.17 to a loss per share of $1.35 in 2020 compared to earnings per share of $0.82 in 2019.\nThe Company's net sales by operating segment are presented below (dollars in millions):\n\u2022In the United States, the increase was primarily due to an increase in sales of golf equipment combined with an increase in apparel sales due to the continued growth of the Travis Mathew business.\nPre-tax income in the Company's Golf Equipment operating segment improved to $140.3 million in 2019 from $128.6 million in 2018. This improvement was primarily due to a $13.3 million increase in gross profit as a result of the increase in net sales as discussed above, partially offset by a decline in gross margin due to a more premium mix of products sold in 2019 compared to 2018, which generally have lower margins due to the higher cost of more advanced technology, in addition to the recognition of higher golf ball manufacturing costs in 2019 associated with the complexity of managing production while completing major capital improvements on the golf ball manufacturing facility. The increase in gross profit was offset by a $1.6 million increase in operating expenses primarily to support the revenue growth period over period, combined with the negative impact from unfavorable changes in foreign currency rates.\nIn most of the regions where the Company conducts business, the game of golf is played primarily on a seasonal basis. Weather conditions generally restrict golf from being played year-round, except in a few markets, with many of the Company's on-course customers closing for the cold weather months. The Company's golf equipment business is therefore subject to seasonal fluctuations. In general, during the first quarter, the Company begins selling its golf club and golf ball products into the golf retail channel for the new golf season. This initial sell-in generally continues into the second quarter. Second-quarter sales are significantly affected by the amount of reorder business of the products sold during the first quarter. Third-quarter sales are generally dependent on reorder business but can also include smaller new product launches, typically resulting in lower sales than the second quarter as many retailers begin decreasing their inventory levels in anticipation of the end of the golf season. Fourth-quarter sales are generally less than the other quarters due to the end of the golf season in many of the Company's key regions. However, third-quarter sales can be affected by a mid-year product launch, and fourth-quarter sales can be affected from time to time by the early launch of product introductions related to the new golf season of the subsequent year. This seasonality, and therefore quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, can be affected by many factors, including the timing of new product introductions as well as weather conditions. In general, because of this seasonality, a majority of the Company's sales from its Golf Equipment operating segment and most, if not all, of its profitability from this segment generally occurs during the first half of the year.\nInformation about the Company's share repurchases during 2020 is presented in Part II, Item 5 in this Form 10-K under the heading \"Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers,\" which is incorporated herein by this reference.\n(5)In connection with lease of the Company's North American distribution Center, the Company financed certain building improvements of $3.8 million, of which $0.2 million was recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and $3.6 million was recorded in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. This financing arrangement is due in February 2035.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, due to the significant disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's operations, the Company performed a qualitative assessment considering the macroeconomic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the potential impact on the Company's sales and operating income for the remainder of fiscal 2020 and potentially beyond. Based on this assessment, the Company determined that there were indicators of impairment, and proceeded with a quantitative assessment of goodwill for all reporting units as well as for its indefinite-lived intangible assets. As a result, the Company recognized impairment losses of $148.4 million to write-off the goodwill associated with the Jack Wolfskin reporting unit, and $25.9 million to write-down the trade name associated with Jack Wolfskin to its new estimated fair value. The Company did not record further impairments in the second half of 2020. For further information, see Note 9 Goodwill and Intangible Assets\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nThe duration of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees varies, and in certain cases may be indefinite. The majority of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation on the maximum amount of future payments the Company could be obligated to make. Historically, costs incurred to settle claims related to indemnities have not been material to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, the\n\nCompany believes the likelihood is remote that payments under the commitments and guarantees described above will have a material effect on the Company's financial condition. The fair value of indemnities, commitments and guarantees that the Company issued during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was not material to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n(5)Represents non-recurring transaction fees associated with the Jack Wolfskin acquisition completed in January 2019, including banker's fees, legal fees, consulting and travel expenses; costs associated with transitioning and reporting on the Jack Wolfskin business, including audit fees for SEC reporting requirements, recruiting fees, and valuation services associated with preparing Jack Wolfskin's opening balance sheet; consulting fees to address an activist investor; and a net loss from the remeasurement of a foreign currency forward contract in connection with the acquisition of Jack Wolfskin, which was denominated in Euros.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2020, certain financial results exclude certain non-cash charges, including the recognition of an impairment loss to write-off goodwill and a portion of the trade name associated with Jack Wolfskin, amortization expense of intangible assets associated with the Jack Wolfskin, OGIO and TravisMathew acquisitions, amortization expense related to the discount of the Convertible Notes issued in May 2020, costs associated with the pending Topgolf merger, and other non-recurring expenses.\nThe amount of revenue the Company recognizes is based on the amount of consideration it expects to receive from customers. The amount of consideration is the sales price adjusted for estimates of variable consideration, including sales returns, discounts and allowances as well as sales programs, sales promotions and price concessions that are offered by the Company as described below. These estimates are based on the amounts earned or expected to be claimed by customers on the related sales, and are therefore recorded as reductions to sales and trade accounts receivable.\n(8)Amount represents the current and non-current portions of uncertain income tax positions as recorded on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. Amounts exclude uncertain income tax positions that the Company would be able to offset against deferred taxes. For further discussion, see Note 13 Income Taxes\u201d in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\n\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $458.3 million (36.9%) to $1,701.1 million compared to $1,242.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to the Company's acquisition of the outdoor apparel, gear and accessories company, Jack Wolfskin, which added incremental sales of $356.2 million to the Company's Apparel, Gear and Other operating segment. Excluding this acquisition, net sales increased $102.0 million (8.2%) for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, primarily due to a 7.3% increase in the Golf Equipment segment as well as the continued success of the TravisMathew apparel business. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 would have been $31.2 million higher using average foreign exchange rates in effect in 2018.\nended December 31, 2019 includes the amortization of the inventory valuation step-up in connection with the Jack Wolfskin acquisition.\n\u2022In Europe, the increase was primarily due to incremental apparel sales resulting from the Jack Wolfskin acquisition completed in January 2019, combined with an increase in sales of golf equipment, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations on sales.\n\u2022The increase in Rest of World was primarily driven by incremental apparel sales in China resulting from the Jack Wolfskin acquisition completed in January 2019, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations on sales.\nSeasonality\n(2)Represents the amortization of intangible assets related to the Company's OGIO and TravisMathew acquisitions in January 2017 and August 2017, respectively, as well as the amortization of intangible assets and the cost impact associated with a change in valuation of inventory (inventory step-up) related to the Company's Jack Wolfskin acquisition in January 2019.\n(1)In January 2019, to fund the purchase price of the Jack Wolfskin acquisition, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement which provided for a Term Loan Facility in an aggregate principal of $480.0 million, which was issued less $9.6 million in original issue discount and other transaction fees. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $441.6 million outstanding under the Term Loan Facility, which is offset by unamortized debt issuance costs of $13.5 million as presented on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. The Term Loan Facility is due in January 2026. For further discussion, see Note 7 \"Financing Arrangements\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nApparel, Gear and Other\nPre-tax income in the Company's Golf Equipment operating segment improved to $148.6 million in 2020 from $140.3 million in 2019. This improvement was primarily due to a $36.0 million decrease in operating expenses, partially offset by a $27.7 million decline in gross profit (a decline of 300 basis points in gross margin). The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to decreases in marketing expenses and employee costs resulting from the Company's cost reduction initiatives in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to decreases in employee travel costs and tour expense resulting from travel restrictions and canceled golf tournaments caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The decline in gross margin was largely due to lower sales and the negative impact of idle facilities during the government mandated shutdown during the first half of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and increased freight expense in the back-half of 2020. This decline was partially offset by a higher mix of direct-to-consumer e-commerce sales, which have higher margins relative the Company's wholesale business.\nNet sales for the full year in 2020 decreased $111.6 million or 6.6% to $1,589.5 million compared to $1,701.1million in 2019. This decrease reflects a $115.1 million or 15.9% decline in net sales of apparel, gear and other, offset by an increase of $3.5 million or 0.4% in net sales of golf equipment, compared to 2019. The overall decline in net sales in 2020 reflects the challenges the Company faced as the result of the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily during the first half of 2020 at the height of the worldwide regulatory restrictions, which resulted in the temporary closure of the Company's retail locations, manufacturing facilities and distribution centers at varying times. The Company began to see signs of improvement coming out of the second quarter of 2020, and in the third and fourth quarters of 2020, the Company experienced record sales due to an unprecedented demand for golf equipment, particularly in the United States and Europe, due to an increased interest in the game of golf, as it supports an active and healthy way of life that is compatible with social distancing. This surge in golf equipment sales also reflects the strength of the Company's product offerings across all skill levels. Additionally, although sales of apparel, gear and other were down substantially for the full year, these soft goods sales rebounded faster than anticipated during the second half of the year, led by the TravisMathew and Jack Wolfskin apparel businesses, which have benefited from strong brand momentum combined with increased outdoor consumer activity. In addition, as government mandated restrictions and retail store closures limited consumers' ability to shop in-store, the Company experienced a higher mix of e-commerce sales in 2020, which increased overall by 34.5%\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $44.8 million to $145.3 million (8.5% of net sales) in 2019 compared to $100.5 million (8.1% of net sales) in 2018. This increase was primarily due to $30.1 million of incremental costs resulting from the addition of the Jack Wolfskin business, in addition to increases of $10.6 million in transaction and transition costs related to the Jack Wolfskin acquisition combined with expense from the purchase accounting amortization of intangible assets, and $3.6 million in legal expense.\n\nIn addition to the contractual obligations listed above, the Company's liquidity could also be adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome with respect to claims and litigation that the Company is subject to from time to time. See Note 14 Commitments & Contingencies\u201d in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nBusiness and Products\nsegment of the market compared to the premium Epic Flash line of fairway woods launched in 2019. Net sales of golf clubs were negatively impacted by $9.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations period over period.\n\n \nGolf Equipment\nDue to the significant business disruption and macro-economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $174.3 million to write-off goodwill and a portion of the trade name associated with Jack Wolfskin. For further discussion, see Note 9 \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets\" to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nThe provision for income taxes decreased by $9.5 million to $16.5 million in 2019, compared to $26.0 million in 2018 primarily due to the decline in pre-tax income. As a percentage of pre-tax income, the Company's effective tax rate during 2019 declined to 17.3% compared to 19.8% in 2018 primarily due to a shift in the mix of foreign earnings relative to the prior year. For further discussion, see Note 13 \"Income Taxes\" to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of the Company's results under GAAP for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 to the Company's non-GAAP results as defined above for the same periods (in millions, except per share information).\nThe provision for income taxes decreased by $17.0 million to a tax benefit of $0.5 million in 2020, compared to a tax provision of $16.5 million in 2019. The Company's effective tax rate as a percentage of pre-tax loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased to 0.4%, compared to 17.3% as a percent of pre-tax income in the comparable period of 2019. This decrease was primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge recorded during the second quarter of 2020, which is non-deductible for tax purposes combined with an overall decline in pre-tax earnings in 2020 compared to 2019. For further discussion, see Note 13 \"Income Taxes\" to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nThe Golf Equipment operating segment, which is comprised of golf club and golf ball products, includes Callaway Golf-branded woods, hybrids, irons, wedges, Odyssey putters, including Toulon Design putters by Odyssey, packaged sets, Callaway Golf and Strata branded golf balls and sales of pre-owned golf clubs.\nLooking forward, the Company anticipates that COVID-19 will continue to negatively impact its business in 2021 as a result of the continued government shutdown orders and other restrictions around the world, although to a lesser degree than in 2020. All of the Company's business segments, as well as the Topgolf business, support an active outdoor lifestyle that is compatible with a world of social distancing and the Company anticipates that its continued brand momentum, increased demand for golf equipment and recovery in its soft goods business will continue into 2021, and therefore help mitigate the impact of COVID-19.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nProfitability by operating segment is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\nThe Company's primary sales program, the Preferred Retailer Program,\u201d offers potential rebates and discounts for participating retailers in exchange for providing certain benefits to the Company, including the maintenance of agreed upon inventory levels, prime product placement and retailer staff training. Under this program, qualifying retailers can earn either discounts or rebates based upon the amount of product purchased. Discounts are applied and recorded at the time of sale. For rebates, the Company estimates the amount of variable consideration related to the rebate at the time of sale based on the customer's estimated qualifying current year product purchases. The estimate is based on the historical level of purchases, adjusted for any factors expected to affect the current year purchase levels. The estimated year-end rebate is adjusted quarterly based on actual purchase levels, as necessary. The Preferred Retailer Program is generally short-term in nature and the actual amount of rebate to be paid under this program is known as of the end of the year and paid to customers shortly after year-end. Historically, the Company's actual amount of variable consideration related to its Preferred Retailer Program has not been materially different from its estimates.\nprimarily due to the Company's proactive soft goods inventory reduction initiatives combined with the negative impact of idle facilities during the government mandated shutdown, fixed costs on the lower sales base caused by the temporary shut-down of the Company's distribution centers and retail locations primarily during the first half of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These declines were partially offset by a higher mix of direct to consumer e-commerce sales, which have higher gross margins relative to the Company's wholesale business. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to decreases in marketing expenses and employee costs resulting from the Company's cost reduction initiatives in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to a decrease in employee travel costs as the result of travel restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOther income increased by $23.4 million to $25.0 million in 2020 compared to $1.6 million in 2019. This increase was due to a $14.8 million increase in net foreign currency transaction gains, combined with the recognition of an $11.0 million net gain in connection with the settlement of a cross-currency swap contract. These increases were partially offset by a net decrease of $4.0 million on gains related to hedging contracts.\nGolf Equipment sales increased $3.5 million (0.4%) to $982.7 million in 2020 compared to $979.2 million in 2019 as a result of an increase of $18.8 million or 2.4% in golf club sales, partially offset by a $15.3 million or 7.2% decrease in golf ball sales. Net sales information for the Golf Equipment segment by product category is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nApparel, Gear and Other\nPre-tax income in the Company's Apparel, Gear and Other operating segment increased to $75.5 million in 2019 from $54.9 million in 2018 primarily due to the addition of the Jack Wolfskin business in January 2019, combined with an improvement in gross margin as a result of the continued success of the TravisMathew apparel business, partially offset by the negative impact of unfavorable changes in foreign currency rates.\nThe Company records an estimate for anticipated returns as a reduction of sales and cost of sales, and accounts receivable in the period that the related sales are recorded. The cost recovery of inventory associated with this reserve is accounted for in other current assets. Sales returns are estimated based upon historical returns, current economic trends, changes in customer demands and sell-through of products. The Company also offers certain customers sales programs that allow for specific returns. The Company records a return reserve for anticipated returns related to these sales programs at the time of the sale based on the terms of the sales program. Historically, the Company's actual sales returns have not been materially different from management's original estimates. The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the allowance for sales returns. However, if the actual costs of sales returns are significantly different than the recorded estimated allowance, the Company may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. Assuming there had been a 10% increase over the recorded estimated allowance for 2020 sales returns less the cost recovery of inventory, pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2020 would have decreased by approximately $4.4 million.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe following table summarizes certain significant cash obligations as of December 31, 2020 that will affect the Company's future liquidity (in millions):\nSegment Profitability\n(3)Represents transaction costs related to the Topgolf merger announced in October 2020, including legal, professional and SEC filing fees, redundant costs associated with the Company's transition of its North America distribution center to a new facility, IT consulting related to the implementation of new IT systems for Jack Wolfskin, and severance charges associated with workforce reductions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nShare Repurchases\n\u2022The increase in Japan was primarily due to an increase in sales of golf equipment.\n\u2022For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, certain of the Company's financial results were presented on a constant currency basis, which estimates what the Company's financial results would have been without changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This information is calculated by taking the current period local currency results and translating them into U.S. dollars based upon the foreign currency exchange rates for the applicable comparable prior period.\nDuring its normal course of business, the Company has made certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which it may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions. These include (i) intellectual property indemnities to the Company's customers and licensees in connection with the use, sale and/or license of Company products or trademarks, (ii) indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility leases for certain claims arising from such facilities or leases, (iii) indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to the goods or services provided to the Company or based on the negligence or willful misconduct of the Company, and (iv) indemnities involving the accuracy of representations and warranties in certain contracts. In addition, the Company has made contractual commitments to each of its officers and certain other employees providing for severance payments upon the termination of employment. The Company has also issued guarantees in the form of a standby letter of credit in the amount of $0.4 million as security for contingent liabilities under certain workers' compensation insurance policies.\nIn connection with the pending Merger with Topgolf discussed above, the Company will reassess its operating and reportable segments at the time the Merger becomes final.\nThe Company has two operating and reportable segments, namely Golf Equipment and Apparel, Gear and Other.\nCOVID-19 also negatively impacted the Company's gross margin. More specifically, the Company's 2020 full year gross margin compared to 2019 declined 370 basis points primarily due to the decrease in sales, the shutdown of its manufacturing plants during the year and the Company's proactive inventory reduction initiatives. To mitigate the effects of COVID-19 on the Company's business, the Company took proactive actions to protect its employees, reduce costs, maximize liquidity, and conserve cash. Reductions in discretionary spending and infrastructure costs, including a reduction in workforce, reduced marketing and travel expenses, and voluntary reductions in compensation by the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer and other members of senior management, have resulted in a significant reduction in planned operating expenses and capital expenditures. As a result of these cost reduction initiatives, the Company realized net savings in operating expenses of $45.3 million (7.1%) (excluding impairment charges of $174.3 million) for the full year in 2020 compared to 2019.\n(9)Amount represents other long-term liabilities included on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020, primarily related to government deferrals of $2.3 million allowed under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ( CARES Act\u201d) in the United States. Amount also includes the future minimum payments under finance leases of $0.7 million, of which $0.3 million were recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and $0.4 million were recorded in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. For further discussion, see Note 3 \"Leases\" in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\n(2)Represents the non-cash amortization of the discount on the Convertible Notes issued in May 2020.\n(4)Total diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis for the year ended December 31, 2020 was calculated using diluted weighted average shares outstanding, as earnings on a non-GAAP basis resulted in net income after giving effect to the non-recurring and non-cash charges discussed above.\n\n(1) In connection with the Company's assessment of its operating and reportable segments the Company also reassessed its reportable regions. As a result, starting on January 1, 2019, the Company began to report regional sales previously reported in rest of Asia and other foreign countries in rest of world. Accordingly, the prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation of regional sales.\nDiscussion of Non-GAAP Measures\nNet sales information for the Apparel, Gear and Other segment is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\nNet sales of Golf Clubs increased $51.0 million (7.1%) to $768.3 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to increases in sales of irons and putters, partially offset by a decline in sales of woods. Net sales of irons and wedges increased due to the successful launch of the Apex and Big Bertha premium lines of irons in 2019 in addition to the 2019 launch of the Epic Forged premium line of irons and MD5 Jaws wedges with no comparable models launched in 2018, combined with the continued success of the prior year Rogue line of irons and MD4 wedges. The increase in putter sales was due to the success of the new platform of Stroke Lab putters launched in 2019. Net sales of woods declined due to the wide success of the Rogue line of fairway woods in 2018, which was a larger core product launch targeted toward a larger\nAllowance for Estimated Credit Losses\nThe Company's cash and cash equivalents increased $259.5 million to $366.1 million at December 31, 2020, from $106.7 million at December 31, 2019, primarily due to proceeds of $258.8 million from the Convertible Notes issued in May 2020 combined with tight working capital management and the Company's cost reduction actions taken in response to COVID-19. This improvement in liquidity was partially offset by the overall decline in earnings period over period due to the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's business during 2020. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company used its cash and cash equivalents combined with the proceeds from the issuance of the Convertible Notes to fund its operations, repay $134.9 million of amounts outstanding under its credit and long-term debt facilities, fund capital expenditures of $39.3 million, primarily for the Company's transition of its North America distribution center to a new facility, investments in its golf ball manufacturing plant and for the implementation of new IT systems. The Company further invested $20.0 million in Topgolf, and repurchased shares of its common stock for $22.2 million. In addition, in connection with the Convertible Notes, the Company paid a premium of $31.8 million for capped call transactions, which are expected to generally reduce the potential dilution to the Company's common stock upon any conversion of the notes. Management expects to fund the Company's future operations from current cash balances and cash provided by its operating activities, combined with borrowings under its current and future credit facilities as well as from other available sources of capital, as deemed necessary. See Note 7 \"Financing Arrangements\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information on the Company's credit facilities, Term Loan Facility and Convertible Notes.\nNet sales of Gear, Accessories & Other decreased $53.7 million (17.3%) to $257.5 million in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to a decline in sales of OGIO-branded bags and Callaway-branded golf bags resulting from the business challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the Company moved a portion of the OGIO business to a licensing arrangement during the current year.\nGolf Equipment\nYears Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\n\n(4)In August 2020, the Company entered into two new long-term financing agreements in connection with the Company's investment initiatives at its North American distribution center in Fort Worth, Texas, and in addition, to improve its manufacturing capabilities at its golf ball manufacturing facility in Chicopee, Massachusetts, the Company entered into a series of long-term financing agreements (collectively, the \"Equipment Notes\") between 2017 and 2020 that are\nThe Company designs, manufactures and sells a full line of high quality golf equipment, including golf clubs and golf balls, and apparel, gear and other products. The Company designs its golf products to be technologically advanced and in this regard invests a considerable amount in research and development each year. The Company designs its golf products for golfers of all skill levels, both amateur and professional. In addition, the Company designs and develops a full line of high quality soft goods, including golf bags, apparel, footwear and other golf accessories. In 2017, the Company expanded its soft goods lines with the acquisitions of OGIO and TravisMathew. Under the OGIO brand, the Company offers a full line of premium personal storage gear for sport and personal use, a line of performance outerwear for men, and golf and apparel accessories. TravisMathew offers a full line of premium golf and lifestyle apparel as well as footwear and accessories. In January 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of JW Stargazer Holding GmbH, the owner of the international, premium outdoor apparel, gear and accessories brand, Jack Wolfskin. This acquisition further enhanced the Company's lifestyle category and provides a platform for future growth in the active outdoor and urban outdoor categories. The Company's soft goods under the Callaway, OGIO, TravisMathew and Jack Wolfskin brands are largely designed and developed internally.\nNet sales information by region is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\n\nThe Company accounts for its foreign currency forward contracts, cross-currency debt swap contracts and interest rate hedge contracts in accordance with ASC Topic 815, \"Derivatives and Hedging\" (\"ASC Topic 815\"). ASC Topic 815 requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet, the measurement of those instruments at fair value and the recognition of changes in the fair value of derivatives in earnings in the period of change, unless the derivative qualifies as a designated cash flow hedge that offsets certain exposures. Certain criteria must be satisfied in order for derivative financial instruments to be classified and accounted for as a cash flow hedge. Gains and losses from the remeasurement of qualifying cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and released into earnings as a component of cost of goods sold or net sales, other income (expense) and interest expense during the period in which the hedged transaction takes place. Remeasurement gains or losses of derivatives that are not elected for hedge accounting treatment are recorded in earnings immediately as a component of other income (expense).\nExecutive Summary of Results of Operations\nNet sales information by region is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\nNet sales of Apparel decreased $61.4 million (15.0%) to $349.3 million in 2020 compared to 2019 due to a decline in sales across all apparel brands as a result of the business challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the temporary closure of retail stores in most major markets, primarily during the second quarter of 2020, combined with additional closures during the fourth quarter of 2020.\nCost of Sales\nPending Merger with Topgolf\nInterest expense increased by $33.8 million to $39.3 million in 2019 compared to $5.5 million in 2018 primarily due to $31.7 million of incremental interest expense recognized from the Term Loan Facility and related debt issuance costs in connection with the Jack Wolfskin acquisition completed in January 2019 (see Note 6 \"Business Combinations\" and Note 7 \"Financing Arrangements\" to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).\n\nResearch and development expenses decreased by $4.3 million to $46.3 million (2.9% of net sales) in 2020 compared to $50.6 million (3.0% of net sales) in 2019. This 8.5% decrease was primarily due to a $4.1 million decline in employee costs resulting from the Company's cost reduction initiatives, and a $1.2 million decline in travel and entertainment as a result of travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nManagement believes the critical accounting policies discussed below affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. For a complete discussion of all of the Company's significant accounting policies, see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\ncompared to e-commerce sales in 2019. The Company anticipates this trend will continue into 2021. Overall, the Company is encouraged that sales in all of its businesses are improving since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOther income decreased by $6.2 million to $1.6 million in 2019 compared to $7.8 million in 2018 primarily due to the recognition of a net loss of $3.9 million from the remeasurement of a foreign currency forward contract that was put in place to mitigate the risk of foreign currency fluctuations on the acquisition of Jack Wolfskin, combined with a decline in net foreign currency gains from non-designated foreign currency hedging contracts, and an increase in net foreign currency transaction losses year over year.\nThe Company's principal sources of liquidity consist of its existing cash balances, including cash from the issuance of the Convertible Notes in May 2020, funds expected to be generated from operations and funds from its credit facilities. Based upon the Company's current cash balances, its estimates of funds expected to be generated from operations in 2021, as well as from current and projected availability under its current or future credit facilities, the Company believes that it will be able to finance current and planned operating requirements, capital expenditures, required debt repayments and contractual obligations and commercial commitments for at least the next 12 months from the issuance of this Form 10-K.\n(1)The Company changed its operating segments as of January 1, 2019. Accordingly, prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation.\n\nestimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory, pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2020 would have decreased by approximately $2.5 million.\n(1)Includes the non-cash amortization expense of intangible assets in connection with the acquisitions of Jack Wolfskin, TravisMathew and OGIO. In addition, the year ended December 31, 2020 includes the recognition of a $174.3 million impairment charge to write down goodwill and a portion of the trade name related to Jack Wolfskin, and the year\nIn addition to the financial results contained in this report, which have been prepared and presented in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, the Company has also included supplemental information concerning the Company's financial results on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP information includes the following:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nYears Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nIncome Taxes\nIn October 2020, the Company entered into a Merger Agreement to acquire Topgolf in an all-stock transaction (see Note 6 \"Business Combinations\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K). In connection with the Merger with Topgolf, the Company anticipates it will assume long-term debt, net of cash, of approximately $550.0 million to $600.0 million. The Company believes that with its continued strong cash generation and increased available liquidity on its debt facilities, its geographic diversity and the strength of its brands, it will be able to fund Topgolf's growth while simultaneously paying its other obligations.\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2019, certain financial results exclude certain non-cash charges, including the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments associated with the Jack Wolfskin acquisition, amortization expense of intangible assets associated with the Jack Wolfskin, OGIO and TravisMathew acquisitions, and transaction and transition costs in connection with the Jack Wolfskin acquisition.\nAfter COVID-19 began, the Company also focused on maximizing cash and liquidity, including the inventory reduction initiatives to generate cash and tight management of working capital generally, combined with the suspension of open market stock repurchases and the cessation of the Company's quarterly dividend. Due to these efforts to maximize cash and liquidity, reduced discretionary spending, and overall business improvement, at December 31, 2020, the Company's liquidity, consisting of cash, including proceeds from the convertible senior notes issued in May 2020, combined with availability under its credit facilities, increased to $632.4 million compared to $303.3 million at December 31, 2019.\non the acquisition of Jack Wolfskin and the Company's credit facilities and long-term debt obligations see Note 6 \"Business Combinations\" and Note 7 \"Financing Arrangements\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nSelling expenses decreased by $46.4 million to $391.8 million (24.7% of net sales) in 2020 compared to $438.2 million (25.8% of net sales) in 2019. This 10.6% decrease was primarily due to the Company's planned reduction in operating expenses in response to the decline in sales caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. These reductions consisted of a $23.6 million decline in marketing and tour expenses due to the cancellation of golf events, a $11.5 million decline in employee costs as a result of the Company's cost reduction initiatives in response to COVID-19, and a $8.3 million decline in employee travel expenses due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, as well as an overall decline in variable expenses.\nLiquidity\nThe Company's accounts receivable balance fluctuates throughout the year as a result of the general seasonality of the Company's business and is also affected by the timing of new product launches. With respect to the Company's Golf Equipment business, the accounts receivable balance will generally be at its highest during the first and second quarters due to the seasonal peak in the golf season, and it will generally decline significantly during the third and fourth quarters as a result of an increase in cash collections and lower sales. The Company's Apparel, Gear and Other accounts receivable balances are expected to be higher during the second half of the year due to the seasonal nature of the Jack Wolfskin business, with a significant portion of its products geared toward the fall/winter season. As of December 31, 2020, the Company's net accounts receivable decreased to $138.5 million from $140.5 million as of December 31, 2019. This $2.0 million decrease was primarily driven by an increase in the reserves for bad debt for certain slow-paying customers impacted by COVID-19, partially offset by an increase in trade receivables resulting from the overall increase in sales of both golf equipment and apparel during the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which includes a reserve for excess, obsolete and/or unmarketable inventory. The Company estimates the reserve based upon current inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience as well as management's estimates of market conditions and forecasts of future product demand, all of which are subject to change. The calculation of the Company's reserve for excess, obsolete and/or unmarketable inventory requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory aging, forecasted consumer demand and pricing, regulatory (USGA and R&A) rule changes, the promotional environment and technological obsolescence. The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the reserve. However, if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or change, the Company may need to increase its inventory allowance, which could significantly adversely affect the Company's operating results. Assuming there had been a 10% increase in obsolete or unmarketable inventory over the 2020 recorded\nNet sales of Golf Clubs increased $18.8 million (2.4%) to $787.1 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in sales volume, partially offset by a decline in average selling prices. The increase in sales volume was driven by an increase in the popularity of golf as a result of the heightened demand for outdoor, socially-distanced activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Also due to the pandemic, sales of golf equipment through the Company's e-commerce channel increased by approximately 24.0% in 2020 compared to 2019. The decline in average selling prices was primarily due to the current year launch of the Mavrik line of drivers and irons, which have a lower average selling price compared to the Epic Flash drivers and Apex irons launched in 2019, combined with a shift in sales mix to lower margin pre-owned products.\nThe Merger Agreement further provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, either party may be required to pay the other party a termination fee of $75.0 million. The Merger is expected to close on or around March 8, 2021, subject to shareholder approval and other customary conditions (see Note 6 Business Combinations\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K).\nDerivatives and Hedging\nResearch and development expenses increased by $9.8 million to $50.6 million (3.0% of net sales) in 2019 compared to $40.8 million (3.3% of net sales) in 2018. This increase was primarily due to $9.3 million of incremental costs resulting from the addition of the Jack Wolfskin business.", "item_7_tables": "Table 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

of Financial Condition and Results of Operations:\n\n- Net sales for 2020 decreased 6.6% to $1.59 billion compared to 2019, primarily due to the disruption from COVID-19. Sales of golf equipment increased slightly while apparel/gear sales declined. \n\n- Gross margin declined 370 basis points in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower sales, idle facilities during shutdowns, and inventory reduction initiatives.\n\n- Net loss in 2020 was $126.9 million compared to net income of $79.4 million in 2019. Loss per share was $1.35 in 2020 versus earnings per share of $0.82 in 2019.\n\n- On a non-GAAP basis, excluding certain charges, net income in 2020 would have been $64.4 million versus $105.7 million in 2019. \n\n- Cash and cash equivalents increased to $366.1 million at December 31, 2020 from $106.7 million at December 31, 2019, primarily due to proceeds from convertible notes issued.\n\n- Liquidity, consisting of cash and availability under credit facilities, increased to $632.4 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $303.3 million at December 31, 2019.\n\n- The company took actions to reduce costs, maximize liquidity, and conserve cash in response to COVID-19, including reductions in workforce, marketing, and capital expenditures.\n\n- In October 2020, the company announced an agreement to acquire Topgolf in an all-stock transaction. The merger is expected to close in Q1 2021.\n\nIn summary, the company faced challenges in 2020 due to COVID-19 but took actions to reduce costs and conserve cash. Liquidity increased significantly during the year and the pending Topgolf acquisition is expected to help drive future growth."}
