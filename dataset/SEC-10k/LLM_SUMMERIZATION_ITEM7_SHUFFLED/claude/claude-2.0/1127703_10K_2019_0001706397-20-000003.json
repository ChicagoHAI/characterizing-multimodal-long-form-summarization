MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion generally focuses on the change in financial condition, results of operation and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 and be should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to those statements which accompany this report. For a full discussion of the changes in the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, please refer to Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" section of ProAssurance's December 31, 2018 report on Form 10-K.\nThroughout the discussion we use certain terms and abbreviations, which can be found in the Glossary of Terms and Acronyms at the beginning of this report. In addition, a glossary of insurance terms and phrases is available on the investor section of our website. Throughout the discussion, references to \"ProAssurance,\" \"PRA,\" \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us\" and \"our\" refer to ProAssurance Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. The discussion contains certain forward-looking information that involves significant risks, assumptions and uncertainties. As discussed under the heading \"Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\" our actual financial condition and operating results could differ significantly from these forward-looking statements.\nProAssurance Overview\nProAssurance Corporation is a holding company for property and casualty insurance companies. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiaries provide professional liability insurance for healthcare professionals and facilities, professional liability insurance for attorneys and their firms, liability insurance for medical technology and life sciences risks and workers' compensation insurance. We also provide capital to Syndicate 1729 and are the sole (100%) capital provider for Syndicate 6131 at Lloyd's of London.\nWe operate in five segments which are based on our internal management reporting structure for which financial results are regularly evaluated by our CODM to determine resource allocation and assess operating performance. Descriptions of ProAssurance's five operating and reportable segments are as follows:\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Specialty P&C - This segment includes our professional liability business and medical technology liability business. Professional liability insurance is primarily offered to healthcare providers and institutions and, to a lesser extent, to attorneys and their firms. Medical technology liability insurance is offered to medical technology and life sciences companies that manufacture or distribute products including entities conducting human clinical trials. We also offer custom alternative risk solutions including loss portfolio transfers, assumed reinsurance and captive cell programs for healthcare professional liability insureds. For our alternative market captive cell programs, we cede either all or a portion of the premium to certain SPCs in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Workers' Compensation Insurance - This segment includes our workers' compensation insurance business which is provided primarily to employers with 1,000 or fewer employees. Our workers' compensation products include guaranteed cost policies, policyholder dividend policies, retrospectively-rated policies, deductible policies and alternative market solutions. Alternative market program premiums are 100% ceded to either SPCs in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment or, to a limited extent, an unaffiliated captive insurer.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance - This segment includes the operating results (underwriting profit or loss, plus investment results) of SPCs at Inova Re and Eastern Re, our Cayman Islands SPC operations. Each SPC is owned, fully or in part, by an agency, group or association, and the operating results of the SPCs are due to the participants of that cell. We participate to a varying degree in the results of selected SPCs and, for the SPCs in which we participate, our participation interest ranges from a low of 20% to a high of 85%. SPC operating results attributable to external cell participants are reflected as an SPC dividend expense (income) in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment. The SPCs assume workers' compensation insurance, healthcare professional liability insurance or a combination of the two from our Workers' Compensation Insurance and Specialty P&C segments. In addition, an SPC at Eastern Re assumed an errors and omissions liability policy from a captive insurer unaffiliated with ProAssurance during 2019. We do not participate in the SPC that assumed this policy; therefore, the operating results of this policy are reflected in the SPC dividend expense (income).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Lloyd's Syndicates - This segment includes the operating results from our participation (61% for the 2019 underwriting year) in Lloyd's of London Syndicate 1729 and our 100% participation in Syndicate 6131, which is an SPA that underwrites on a quota share basis with Syndicate 1729. To reduce our exposure and the associated earnings volatility, we decreased our participation in the operating results of Syndicate 1729 for the 2020 underwriting year from 61% to 29%. The results of this segment are normally reported on a quarter lag, except when information is available that is material to the current period. Syndicate 1729 underwrites risks over a wide range of property and casualty insurance and reinsurance lines in both the U.S. and international markets while\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSyndicate 6131 focuses on contingency and specialty property business, also within the U.S. and international markets.\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Corporate - This segment includes our investment operations, other than those reported in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance and Lloyd's Syndicates segments, interest expense and U.S. income taxes. This segment also includes non-premium revenues generated outside of our insurance entities and corporate expenses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Additional information regarding our segments is included in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Part I and in the Segment Operating Results sections that follow.\nGrowth Opportunities and Outlook\nOver the long-term we expect our growth to come primarily through controlled expansion of our existing operations. In addition, from time to time, we may identify opportunities for growth through the acquisition of other insurers, service providers or books of business. Growth through acquisition is often opportunistic and cannot be predicted.\nWe operate in very competitive markets and face strong competition from other insurance companies for all of our insurance products. HCPL insurance represents the largest product line in our gross premiums written (53% in 2019) and the healthcare market has been trending toward the formation of larger medical practice groups and the employment of physicians by hospitals. Large medical groups and facilities frequently manage their healthcare professional liability exposure outside of the traditional first dollar insurance marketplace using self-insured mechanisms and other risk sharing arrangements. In response to these trends, we offer products designed to provide greater risk sharing options to hospitals and large physician groups. Since the middle of 2019, new senior leadership in our Specialty P&C segment has executed a comprehensive underwriting strategy in response to emerging loss trends and changing conditions in the HCPL industry. This includes organizational structure enhancements, recruitment of additional talent in specialty underwriting, price strengthening and tightening of underwriting criteria, terms and conditions. Furthermore, the new senior leadership team for our Specialty P&C segment executed several strategic business decisions intended to improve operating performance by bringing together all of the Specialty P&C segment lines of business and operations under a unified organizational and management structure.\nWe believe our position in the healthcare liability space is strengthened by our ability to offer synergistic solutions through our operations at Eastern, a provider of workers' compensation insurance which currently represents the second largest product line in our gross premiums written (28% in 2019, including alternative market premiums). The workers' compensation industry is highly competitive in the geographic markets in which we operate and multi-line insurers continue to increase their leverage of workers' compensation business in their product offerings. We believe our workers' compensation product offerings allow us to provide flexibility in offering solutions to our customers at a competitive price. In addition, we believe that our claims handling and risk management services are attractive to our customers and provide us with a competitive advantage even when our pricing is higher than our competitors.\nWe have also been a consistent acquirer of other physician insurers, completing four acquisitions between 2009 and 2013 as well as acquiring an agency largely focused on the professional liability needs of allied healthcare providers, an insurer focused on the legal professional liability market and a mutual company that focused on medical technology liability insurance for companies that manufacture or distribute medical products.\nWe provide capital to Lloyd's of London Syndicate 1729 and Syndicate 6131 which represents 11% of our gross premiums written in 2019. As previously discussed, to reduce our exposure and the associated earnings volatility, we decreased our participation in the operating results of Syndicate 1729 for the 2020 underwriting year from 61% to 29%. Our allocated share of Syndicate 1729's maximum underwriting capacity for 2020 is \u00a339 million (approximately $51 million at December 31, 2019). We continue to provide 100% of the capital to Syndicate 6131 which has a maximum underwriting capacity for the 2020 underwriting year of \u00a312 million (approximately $15.9 million at December 31, 2019).\nWe believe our emphasis on the fair treatment of our insureds and other important stakeholders through our commitment to Treated Fairly\u201d has enhanced our market position and differentiated us from other insurers. We will continue to practice our values of integrity, leadership, relationships and enthusiasm in all of our activities. We will honor these values in the execution of Treated Fairly\u201d to perform our Mission and realize our Vision. We believe that as we reach more customers with this message we will continue to improve retention and add new insureds.\nKey Performance Measures\nWe are committed to disciplined underwriting, pricing and loss reserving practices as well as conservative investment practices, even during difficult market conditions. We are also committed to maintaining prudent operating and financial leverage. We recognize the importance that our customers and producers place on the financial strength of our insurance subsidiaries, and we manage our business to protect our financial security.\nIn evaluating our performance, we consider a number of performance measures, including the following:\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The net loss ratio which is calculated as net losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned and is a component of underwriting profitability.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The underwriting expense ratio which is calculated as underwriting, policy acquisition and operating expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned and is a component of underwriting profitability.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The combined ratio which is the sum of the net loss ratio and the underwriting expense ratio and measures underwriting profitability.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The investment income ratio which is calculated as net investment income divided by net premiums earned and measures the contribution investment earnings provide to our overall profitability.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The operating ratio which is the combined ratio, less the investment income ratio. This ratio provides the combined effect of underwriting profitability and investment income.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The tax ratio which is calculated as total income tax expense (benefit) divided by income (loss) before income taxes and measures our effective tax rate.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>ROE which is calculated as net income divided by the average of beginning and ending shareholders' equity. This ratio measures our overall after-tax profitability and shows how efficiently capital is being used.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Book value per share which is calculated as total shareholders' equity at the balance sheet date divided by the total number of common shares outstanding. This ratio measures the net worth of the company to shareholders on a per-share basis. The declaration of dividends decreases book value per share. Growth in book value per share, adjusted for dividends declared, is an indicator of overall profitability.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We particularly focus on our combined ratio and investment returns, both of which directly affect our ROE and growth in our book value. We currently target a dynamic long-term ROE of 700 basis points above the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate, which at December 31, 2019 was approximately 8.9%.\nOur emphasis on rate adequacy, selective underwriting, effective claims management and prudent investments is a key factor in our ability to achieve our long-term ROE target. We closely monitor premium revenues, losses and loss adjustment expenses, and underwriting and policy acquisition expenses. Our overall investment strategy is to focus on maximizing current income from our investment portfolio while maintaining safety, liquidity, duration and portfolio diversification. While we engage in activities that generate other income, these activities, such as insurance agency services, do not constitute a significant use of our resources or a significant source of revenues or profits.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP. Preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts we report on those statements. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based on current and historical developments, market conditions, industry trends and other information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We can make no assurance that actual results will conform to our estimates and assumptions; reported results of operations may be materially affected by changes in these estimates and assumptions.\nManagement considers the following accounting estimates to be critical because they involve significant judgment by management and those judgments could result in a material effect on our financial statements.\nReserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nThe largest component of our liabilities is our reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses (\"reserve for losses\" or \"reserve\"), and the largest component of expense for our operations is incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as losses and loss adjustment expenses,\u201d incurred losses,\u201d losses incurred\u201d and losses\u201d). Incurred losses reported in any period reflect our estimate of losses incurred related to the premiums earned in that period as well as any changes to our previous estimate of the reserve required for prior periods.\nAs of December 31, 2019 our reserve is comprised almost entirely of long-tail exposures. The estimation of long-tailed losses is inherently difficult and is subject to significant judgment on the part of management. Due to the nature of our claims, our loss costs, even for claims with similar characteristics, can vary significantly depending upon many factors, including but not limited to the specific characteristics of the claim and the manner in which the claim is resolved. Long-tailed insurance is characterized by the extended period of time typically required both to assess the viability of a claim and potential damages, if any, and to reach a resolution of the claim. The claims resolution process may extend to more than five years. The combination of continually changing conditions and the extended time required for claim resolution results in a loss cost estimation process that requires actuarial skill and the application of significant judgment, and such estimates require periodic modification.\nOur reserve is established by management after taking into consideration a variety of factors including premium rates, claims frequency and severity, historical paid and incurred loss development trends, the expected effect of inflation, general economic and social trends, the legal and political environment and the conclusions reached by our internal and consulting actuaries. We update and review the data underlying the estimation of our reserve for losses each reporting period and make adjustments to loss estimation assumptions that we believe best reflect emerging data. Both our internal and consulting actuaries perform an in-depth review of our reserve for losses on at least a semi-annual basis using the loss and exposure data of our insurance subsidiaries.\nWe partition our reserves by accident year, which is the year in which the claim becomes our liability. For claims-made policies, the insured event generally becomes a liability when the event is first reported to us. For occurrence policies, the insured event becomes a liability when the event takes place. For retroactive coverages, the insured event becomes a liability at inception of the underlying contract. As claims are incurred (reported) and claim payments are made, they are aggregated by accident year for analysis purposes. We also partition our reserves by reserve type: case reserves and IBNR reserves. Case reserves are established by our claims departments based upon the particular circumstances of each reported claim and represent our estimate of the future loss costs (often referred to as expected losses) that will be paid on reported claims. Case reserves are decremented as claim payments are made and are periodically adjusted upward or downward as estimates regarding the amount of future losses are revised; reported loss for an individual claim is the case reserve at any point in time plus the claim payments that have been made to date. IBNR reserves represent our estimate in the aggregate of future development on losses that have been reported to us and our estimate of losses that have been incurred but not reported to us.\nOur reserving process can be broadly grouped into three areas: the establishment of the reserve for the current accident year (the initial reserve), the re-estimation of the reserve for prior accident years (development of prior accident years) and the establishment of the initial reserve for risks assumed in business combinations, applicable only in periods in which acquisitions occur (the acquired reserve). A summary of the activity in our net reserve for losses during 2019 and 2018 is provided under the heading \"Losses\" in the Liquidity and Capital Resources and Financial Condition section that follows.\nCurrent Accident Year - Initial Reserve\nConsiderable judgment is required in establishing our initial reserve for any current accident year period, as there is limited data available upon which to base our estimate (see further discussion that follows under the heading \"Uses of Judgment\"). Our process for setting an initial reserve considers the unique characteristics of each product, but in general we rely heavily on the loss assumptions that were used to price business, as our pricing reflects our analysis of loss costs that we expect to incur relative to the insurance product being priced.\nSpecialty P&C Segment. Loss costs within this segment are impacted by many factors including but not limited to the nature of the claim, including whether or not the claim is an individual or a mass tort claim, the personal situation of the claimant or the claimant's family, the outcome of jury trials, the legislative and judicial climate where any potential litigation may occur, general economic and social trends and, for claims involving bodily injury, the trend of healthcare costs. Within our Specialty P&C segment, for our HCPL business (76% of our consolidated gross reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2019), we set an initial reserve based upon our evaluation of the current loss environment including frequency, severity, economic inflation, social inflation and legal trends. The initial loss ratio for our HCPL business has ranged from 87% to 106% in recent years. We have recently trended towards the higher end of this range due to increased reserve estimates for a large national healthcare account that far exceeded the assumptions we made when originally underwriting the account as well as increases in loss severity in the broader HCPL industry, including our excess and surplus lines of business. See further discussion on our current accident year net loss ratio in our Segment Operating Results - Specialty Property & Casualty section that follows under the heading \"Losses.\"A similar practice is followed for our legal professional liability business (3% of our consolidated gross reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2019).\nThe risks insured in our medical technology liability business (3% of our consolidated gross reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2019) are more varied, and policies are individually priced based on the risk characteristics of the policy and the account. The insured risks range from startup operations to large multinational entities, and the larger entities often have significant deductibles or self-insured retentions. Reserves are established using our most recently developed actuarial estimates of losses expected to be incurred based on factors which include results from prior analysis of similar business, industry indications, observed trends and judgment. Claims in this line of business primarily involve bodily injury to individuals and are affected by factors similar to those of our HCPL line of business. For the medical technology liability business, we also establish an initial reserve using a loss ratio approach, including a provision in consideration of historical loss volatility that this line of business has exhibited.\nWorkers' Compensation Insurance Segment. Many factors affect the ultimate losses incurred for our workers' compensation coverages (10% of our consolidated gross reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2019) including but not limited to the type and severity of the injury, the age, health and occupation of the injured worker, the estimated length of disability, medical treatment and related costs, and the jurisdiction and workers' compensation laws of the state of the injury occurrence. We use various actuarial methodologies in developing our workers' compensation reserve, combined with a review of the payroll exposure base. For the current accident year, given the lack of seasoned information, the different actuarial methodologies produce results with significant variability; therefore, more emphasis is placed on supplementing results from the actuarial methodologies with trends in exposure base, medical expense inflation, general inflation, severity, and claim counts, among other things, to select an expected loss ratio.\nSegregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance Segment. The factors that affect the ultimate losses incurred for the workers' compensation and healthcare professional liability coverages assumed by the SPCs at Inova Re and Eastern Re (4% of our consolidated gross reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2019) are consistent with that of our Workers' Compensation Insurance and Specialty P&C segments, respectively.\nLloyd's Syndicates Segment. Initial reserves for Syndicate 1729 and Syndicate 6131 are primarily recorded using the loss assumptions by risk category incorporated into each Syndicate's business plan submitted to Lloyd's with consideration given to loss experience incurred to date (4% of our consolidated gross reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2019). The assumptions used in each business plan are consistent with loss results reflected in Lloyd's historical data for similar risks. The loss ratios may also fluctuate due to the timing of earned premium adjustments. Such adjustments may be the result of premiums for certain policies and assumed reinsurance contracts being reported subsequent to the coverage period and may be subject to adjustment based on loss experience. Premium and exposure for some of Syndicate 1729's insurance policies and reinsurance contracts are initially estimated and subsequently recorded over an extended period of time as reports are received under delegated underwriting authority programs. When reports are received, the premium, exposure and corresponding loss estimates are revised accordingly. Changes in loss estimates due to premium or exposure fluctuations are incurred in the accident year in which the premium is earned.\nFor significant property catastrophe exposures, Syndicate 1729 uses third-party catastrophe models to accumulate a listing of potentially affected policies. Each identified policy is given an estimate of loss severity based upon a combination of factors including the probable maximum loss of each policy, market share analytics, underwriting judgment, client/broker estimates and historical loss trends for similar events. These models are inherently uncertain, reliant upon key assumptions and management judgment and are not always a representation of actual events and ensuing potential loss exposure. Determination of actual losses may take an extended period of time until claims are reported and resolved, including coverage litigation.\nDevelopment of Prior Accident Years\nIn addition to setting the initial reserve for the current accident year, each period we reassess the amount of reserve required for prior accident years.\nThe foundation of our reserve re-estimation process is an actuarial analysis that is performed by both our internal and consulting actuaries. This very detailed analysis projects ultimate losses based on partitions which include line of business, geography, coverage layer and accident year. The procedure uses the most representative data for each partition, capturing its unique patterns of development and trends. In all there are over 200 different partitions of our business for purposes of this analysis. We believe that the use of consulting actuaries provides an independent view of our loss data as well as a broader perspective on industry loss trends.\nFor the Specialty P&C, Workers' Compensation Insurance and Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segments, the analysis performed by the consulting actuaries analyzes each partition of our business in a variety of ways and uses multiple actuarial methodologies in performing these analyses, including:\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Bornhuetter-Ferguson (Paid and Reported) Method\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Paid Development Method\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Reported (Incurred) Development Method\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Average Paid Value Method\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Average Reported Value Method\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The Adjusted Reported and the Adjusted Paid Methods\n</td> </tr>\n</table> A brief description of each method follows.\nBornhuetter-Ferguson Method. We use both the Paid and the Reported Bornhuetter-Ferguson Methods. The Paid Method assigns partial weight to initial expected losses for each accident year (initial expected losses being the first established case and IBNR reserves for a specific accident year) and partial weight to paid to date losses. The Reported Method assigns partial weight to the initial expected losses and partial weight to current expected losses. The weights assigned to the initial expected losses decrease as the accident year matures.\nPaid Development and Reported (Incurred) Development Methods. These methods use historical, cumulative losses (paid losses for the Paid Development Method, reported losses for the Reported (Incurred) Development Method) by accident year and develop those actual losses to estimated ultimate losses based upon the assumption that each accident year will develop to estimated ultimate cost in a manner that is analogous to prior years, adjusted as deemed appropriate for the expected effects of known changes in the claim payment environment (and case reserving environment for the Reported (Incurred) Development Method); and to the extent necessary, supplemented by analyses of the development of broader industry data.\nAverage Paid Value and Average Reported Value Methods. In these methods, average claim cost data (paid claim cost for the Average Paid Value Method and reported claim cost for the Reported Value Method) is developed to an ultimate average cost level by report year based on historical data. Claim counts are similarly developed to an ultimate count level. The average claim cost (after rounding and adjustment, if necessary, to accommodate report year data that is not considered to be predictive) is then multiplied by the ultimate claim counts by report year to derive ultimate loss and ALAE.\nThe Adjusted Reported and the Adjusted Paid Methods. These methods are based on the premise that the relative change in a given accident year's adjusted reported loss estimates (Adjusted Reported Method) or adjusted paid losses (Adjusted Paid Method) from one evaluation point to the next is similar to changes observed for earlier accident years at the same evaluation points. In the Adjusted Reported Method reported loss estimates are adjusted to reflect a common case reserve adequacy basis. In the Adjusted Paid Method, the historical paid loss experience is adjusted to reflect a common claim settlement rate basis. We principally use these methods to evaluate reserves for our legal liability coverages.\nGenerally, methods such as the Bornhuetter-Ferguson Method are used on more recent accident years where we have less data on which to base our analysis. As time progresses and we have an increased amount of data for a given accident year, we begin to give more confidence to the development and average methods, as these methods typically rely more heavily on our own historical data. These methods emphasize different aspects of loss reserve estimation and provide a variety of perspectives for our decisions.\nCertain of the methodologies utilized to estimate the ultimate losses for each partition of our reserves consider the actual amounts paid. Paid data is particularly influential when a large portion of known claims have been closed, as is the case for older accident years. In selecting a point estimate for each partition, management considers the extent to which trends are emerging consistently for all partitions and known industry trends. Thus, actual, rather than estimated severity trends are given more consideration. If actual severity trends are lower than those estimated at the time that reserves were previously established, the recognition of favorable development is indicated. This is particularly true for older accident years where our actuarial methodologies give more weight to actual loss costs (severity).\nThe various actuarial methods discussed above are applied in a consistent manner from period to period. In addition, we perform statistical reviews of claims data such as claim counts, average settlement costs and severity trends when establishing our reserves.\nWe utilize the selected point estimates of ultimate losses to develop estimates of ultimate losses recoverable from reinsurers, based on the terms and conditions of our reinsurance agreements. An overall estimate of the amount receivable from reinsurers is determined by combining the individual estimates. Our net reserve estimate is the gross reserve point estimate less the estimated reinsurance recovery.\nFor our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment and for the workers' compensation exposures in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment, we utilize the Reported (Incurred) Development Method, Paid Development Method and Bornhuetter-Ferguson Method, to develop our reserve for each accident year. The actuarial review includes the stratification of claims data (lost time claims, medical only claims) using different variations that allow us to identify trends that may not be readily identifiable if the data was evaluated only in the aggregate. Reported and paid loss development factors are key assumptions in the reserve estimation process and are based on our historical reported and paid loss development patterns. As accident years mature, the various actuarial methodologies produce more consistent loss estimates.\nFor our Lloyd's Syndicates segment we rely on the analysis of actual loss experience on the book of business written by Syndicate 1729 to determine loss development by accident year.\nAcquired Reserve\nThe acquisition of Eastern on January 1, 2014 increased our loss reserve by $153.2 million which represented the fair value of Eastern's loss reserve at the time of the acquisition. The fair value of the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses and related reinsurance recoverables was based on an actuarial estimate of the expected future net cash flows, a reduction of those cash flows for the time value of money determined utilizing the U.S. Treasury Yield Curve, and a risk adjustment to reflect the net present value of profit that an investor would demand in return for the assumption of the associated risks. Expected net cash flows were derived from the expected loss payment patterns included in an actuarial analysis of Eastern's reserve performed as of December 31, 2013. The fair value of the reserve, including the risk margin discussed above, exceeded the undiscounted loss reserve previously established by Eastern by $9.3 million; this fair value adjustment was amortized over the average expected life of the reserve of 6 years. The fair value adjustment has been fully amortized as of December 31, 2019.\nUse of Judgment\nThe process of estimating reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. These variables can be affected by both views of internal and external events, such as changes in views of economic inflation, legal trends and legislative changes, as well as differentiating views of individuals involved in the reserve estimation process, among others. We continually refine our estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical loss experience develops and additional claims are reported and settled. Our objective is to consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the time.\nWe use various actuarial methods in the process of setting reserves. Each actuarial method generally returns a different value, and for the more recent accident years the variations among the various methodologies can be significant. For each partition of our reserves, we evaluate the results of the various methods, along with the supplementary statistical data regarding such factors as closed with and without indemnity ratios, claim severity trends, the expected duration of such trends, changes in the legal and legislative environment and the current economic environment to develop a point estimate based upon management's judgment and past experience. The series of selected point estimates is then combined to produce an overall point estimate for ultimate losses.\nHCPL. Over the past several years the most influential factor affecting the analysis of our HCPL reserves and the related development recognized has been an observed increase in claim severity for the broader HCPL industry as well as higher initial loss expectations on incurred claims. The severity trend is an explicit component of our pricing models, whereas in our reserving process the severity trend's impact is implicit. Our estimate of this trend and our expectations about changes in this trend impact a variety of factors, from the selection of expected loss ratios to the ultimate point estimates established by management.\nBecause of the implicit and wide-ranging nature of severity trend assumptions on the loss reserving process, it is not practical to specifically isolate the impact of changing severity trends. However, because severity is an explicit component of our HCPL pricing process we can better isolate the impact that changing severity can have on our loss costs and loss ratios in regards to our pricing models for this business component. Our current HCPL pricing models assume severity trends in the range of 2% to 5% depending on state, territory and specialty. In some portions of our HCPL business we have observed and reflected higher severity trends in our estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses.\nIf the severity trend were to be higher by 1 percentage point, the impact would be an increase in our initial expected loss ratio for this business of 3.2 percentage points, based on current claim disposition patterns. An increase in the severity trend of 3 percentage points would result in a 10.1 percentage point increase in our initial expected loss ratio. Due to the long-tailed nature of our claims and the previously discussed historical volatility of loss costs, selection of a severity trend assumption is a\nsubjective process that is inherently likely to prove inaccurate over time. Given the long tail and volatility, we are generally cautious in making changes to the severity assumptions within our pricing models. All open claims and accident years are generally impacted by a change in the severity trend, which compounds the effect of such a change.\nAlthough the future degree and impact of the ultimate severity trend remains uncertain due to the long-tailed nature of our business, we have given consideration to observed loss costs in setting our rates. For our HCPL business, this practice had generally resulted in rate reductions as claim frequency declined and remained at historically low levels. For example, on average, excluding our podiatry business acquired in 2009, we had gradually reduced the premium rates we charged on our standard physician renewal business (our largest HCPL line) by approximately 17% from the beginning of 2006 to December 31, 2016.\nHowever, from early 2017 to December 31, 2019, the average charged premium rates on our standard physician renewal business have increased by approximately 4% per annum, and we anticipate further rate increases due to indications of increasing loss severity.\nWorkers' Compensation. The projection of changes in claim severity trend has not historically been an influential factor affecting our analysis of workers' compensation reserves, as claims are typically resolved more quickly than the industry norm. As previously mentioned, the determination and calculation of loss development factors, in particular, the selection of tail factors which are used to extend the projection of losses beyond historical data, requires considerable judgment.\nLoss Development\nWe recognized net favorable reserve development of $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, of which $10.1 million related to our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment and $7.8 million related to our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment, partially offset by net unfavorable reserve development of $5.7 million and $0.4 million related to our Specialty P&C and Lloyd's Syndicates segments, respectively.\nNet favorable reserve development recognized within our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment primarily reflected better than expected claim trends in the 2015 through 2018 accident years. The improved claim trends reflected lower frequency and severity than anticipated at the time the reserves were established.\nNet favorable reserve development recognized within our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment reflected overall favorable trends in claim closing patterns primarily in the 2015 and 2016 accident years.\nNet unfavorable reserve development of $5.7 million in our Specialty P&C segment was driven by $51.5 million of unfavorable reserve development recognized in 2019 related to our reserves for the previously mentioned large national healthcare account that has experienced losses far exceeding the assumptions we made when underwriting the account, beginning in 2016. Excluding the unfavorable reserve development related to this account, the Specialty P&C segment recognized favorable reserve development totaling $45.8 million in 2019 which included favorable reserve development in our medical technology liability line of business of $12.8 million. Net favorable reserve development in 2018 of $77.0 million included $13.3 million and $10.9 million attributable to our medical technology liability and legal professional liability lines of business, respectively. While the majority of our reserves in our Specialty P&C segment continue to develop favorably, the favorable development we recognized, excluding the large national healthcare account, was lower as compared to 2018, in part due to the observed increase in claim severity in the broader HCPL industry. See further discussion in our Segment Operating Results - Specialty Property & Casualty section that follows under the heading \"Losses.\"\nNet unfavorable development recognized within our Lloyd's Syndicates segment was driven by higher than expected losses and development on certain large claims which resulted in unfavorable development with respect to a previous year of account. See further discussion in our Segment Operating Results - Lloyd's Syndicates section that follows.\nLoss Development by Line of Business\nProfessional Liability\nOur professional liability line of business includes both our HCPL and legal professional lines, with our HCPL line representing the largest component of our reserve. In support of our concern that the decline in frequency will result in a higher severity trend for our HCPL claims, we saw our closed-with-indemnity-payment ratio (i.e., the number of claims closed with an indemnity or loss payment as compared to the total number of closed claims) for our claims increase from 10% in 2005 to 18% in 2019.\nThe following table presents additional information about

experience in our HCPL excess and surplus lines of business deteriorated further, particularly in regard to the reserves we established for a large national healthcare account, as previously discussed. This deterioration is the primary driver of the unfavorable development we recognized in 2019 for accident years 2016-2018. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, reflection of higher severity trends in certain HCPL lines of business also resulted in increases of estimated ultimate losses for open claims for earlier accident years, which resulted in a lower amount of favorable development recognized in 2018 and 2017 as compared to earlier years.\nThis can be seen in looking at both the absolute amount of reserve development recognized for the less developed accident years as well as the size of such development when compared to established ultimates for those same accident years at the end of the preceding calendar year.

accident years. The development for the 2014 to 2017 accident years represents a 13.7% reduction to the ultimates established for those reserves at December 31, 2018. Approximately $5.7 million of the $13.3 million total net favorable development recognized in 2018 related to the 2013 to 2016 accident years. The development for the 2013 to 2016 accident years represents a 12.3% reduction to the ultimates established for those reserves at December 31, 2017. Approximately $5.8 million of the $10.1 million total net favorable development recognized in 2017 related to the 2012 to 2015 accident years. The development for the 2012 to 2015 accident years represents a 12.1% reduction to the ultimates established for those reserves at December 31, 2016.\nIn 2019, 2018 and 2017 the development was largely attributable to favorable results from claims closed during the year. As time has elapsed we have recognized that actual loss experience has on average been better than estimated. We have been cautious in recognizing the improvement, but as claims have matured and claims are closed or have become more certain for the remaining open claims, we have revised reserve estimates. We believe the need for a cautious approach is required as outcomes are uncertain and results can be significantly affected by outcomes for a small number of cases.\nWorkers' Compensation\nClaims in our workers' compensation line of business have historically closed at a faster rate than in our HCPL or medical technology liability lines of business. This faster disposition rate, along with a lower net retention after the application of reinsurance, has resulted in less volatility in loss estimates on a net basis. However, a change in the number of individually-severe claims can create volatility in a given accident year.

In 2018, we recognized $9.0 million of net favorable development in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment and $8.0 million of net favorable development in our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment. In 2017, we recognized $8.5 million of net favorable development in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment and $5.7 million of net favorable development in our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment. In each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, net favorable development in our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment included $1.6 million related to the amortization of the purchase accounting fair value adjustment. As previously discussed, this fair value adjustment has been fully amortized as of December 31, 2019.\nVariability of Loss Reserves\nAs previously noted, the number of data points and variables considered and the subjective process followed in establishing our loss reserve makes it impractical to isolate individual variables and demonstrate their impact on our estimate of loss reserves. However, to provide a better understanding of the potential variability in our reserves, we have modeled implied reserve ranges around our single point net reserve estimates for our various lines of business assuming different confidence levels. The ranges have been developed by aggregating the expected volatility of losses across partitions of our business to obtain a consolidated distribution of potential reserve outcomes. The aggregation of this data takes into consideration correlations among our geographic and specialty mix of business. The result of the correlation approach to aggregation is that the ranges are narrower than the sum of the ranges determined for each partition.\nWe have used this modeled statistical distribution to calculate an 80% and 60% confidence interval for the potential outcome of our consolidated net reserve for losses. The high and low end points of the distributions are as follows:\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Low End Point\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Carried Net Reserve\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>High End Point\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>80% Confidence Level\n</td> <td>$1.479 billion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1.956 billion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2.517 billion\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>60% Confidence Level\n</td> <td>$1.649 billion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1.956 billion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2.263 billion\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAny change in our estimate of net ultimate losses for prior years is reflected in net income in the period in which such changes are made.\nDue to the size of our consolidated reserve for losses and the large number of claims outstanding at any point in time, even a small percentage adjustment to our total reserve estimate could have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is made, as was the case in 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nReinsurance\nWe use insurance and reinsurance (collectively, reinsurance\u201d) to provide capacity to write larger limits of liability, to provide reimbursement for losses incurred under the higher limit coverages we offer, to provide protection against losses in excess of policy limits and, in the case of risk sharing arrangements, to align our objectives with those of our strategic business partners and to provide custom insurance solutions for large customer groups. The purchase of reinsurance does not relieve us from the ultimate risk on our policies; however, it does provide reimbursement for certain losses we pay.\nWe make a determination of the amount of insurance risk we choose to retain based upon numerous factors, including our risk tolerance and the capital we have to support it, the price and availability of reinsurance, the volume of business, our level of experience with a particular set of claims and our analysis of the potential underwriting results. We purchase excess of loss reinsurance to limit the amount of risk we retain and we do so from a number of companies to mitigate concentrations of credit risk. We utilize reinsurance brokers to assist us in the placement of these reinsurance programs and in the analysis of the credit quality of our reinsurers. The determination of which reinsurers we choose to do business with is based upon an evaluation of their then current financial strength, rating, stability and claims payment practices.\nWe evaluate each of our ceded reinsurance contracts at inception to confirm that there is sufficient risk transfer to allow the contract to be accounted for as reinsurance under current accounting guidance. At December 31, 2019, all ceded contracts were accounted for as risk transferring contracts.\nOur receivable from reinsurers on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses represents our estimate of the amount of our reserve for losses that will be recoverable under our reinsurance programs. We base our estimate of funds recoverable upon our expectation of ultimate losses and the portion of those losses that we estimate to be allocable to reinsurers based upon the terms and conditions of our reinsurance agreements. Our assessment of the collectability of the recorded amounts receivable from reinsurers considers the payment history of the reinsurer, publicly available financial and rating agency data, our interpretation of the underlying contracts and policies and responses by reinsurers.\nGiven the uncertainty inherent in our estimates of losses and related amounts recoverable from reinsurers, these estimates may vary significantly from the ultimate outcome.\nUnder the terms of certain of our reinsurance agreements, the amount of premium that we cede to our reinsurers is based in part on the losses we recover under the agreements. Therefore, we make an estimate of premiums ceded under these reinsurance agreements subject to certain maximums and minimums. Any adjustments to our estimates of losses recoverable under our reinsurance agreements or the premiums owed under our agreements are reflected in then current operations. Due to the size of our reinsurance balances, an adjustment to these estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is made.\nThe financial strength of our reinsurers and their ability to pay us may change in the future due to forces or events we cannot control or anticipate. We have not experienced significant collection difficulties due to the financial condition of any reinsurer as of December 31, 2019; however, reinsurers may periodically dispute our demand for reimbursement from them based upon their interpretation of the terms of our agreements. As of December 31, 2019, reinsurance recoverables totaling approximately $92.6 million were collateralized by letters of credit or funds withheld. We had no allowance for credit losses related to our reinsurance receivables at December 31, 2019 or 2018 as all reinsurance balances were considered collectible. No reinsurance balances were written off for credit reasons during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, and reinsurance balances written off for credit reasons during the year ended December 31, 2017 were nominal in amount. Should future events lead us to believe that any reinsurer will not meet its obligations to us, adjustments to the amounts recoverable would be reflected in the results of current operations. Such an adjustment has the potential to be material to the results of operations in the period in which it is recorded; however, we would not expect such an adjustment to have a material effect on our capital position or our liquidity.\nInvestment Valuations\nWe record the majority of our investments at fair value as shown in the table below. At December 31, 2019, the distribution of our investments based on GAAP fair value hierarchies (levels) was as follows:\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Distribution by GAAP Fair Value Hierarchy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Level 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Level 2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Level 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Not Categorized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\nInvestments\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments recorded at:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value\n</td> <td>16%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other valuations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. All of our fixed maturity and equity investments are carried at fair value. The fair value of our short-term securities approximates the cost of the securities due to their short-term nature.\nBecause of the number of securities we own and the complexity of developing accurate fair values, we utilize multiple independent pricing services to assist us in establishing the fair value of individual securities. The pricing services provide fair values based on exchange-traded prices, if available. If an exchange-traded price is not available, the pricing services, if possible, provide a fair value that is based on multiple broker/dealer quotes or that has been developed using pricing models. Pricing models vary by asset class and utilize currently available market data for securities comparable to ours to estimate a fair value for our securities. The pricing services scrutinize market data for consistency with other relevant market information before including the data in the pricing models. The pricing services disclose the types of pricing models used and the inputs used for each asset class. Determining fair values using these pricing models requires the use of judgment to identify appropriate comparable securities and to choose a valuation methodology that is appropriate for the asset class and available data.\nThe pricing services provide a single value per instrument quoted. We review the values provided for reasonableness each quarter by comparing market yields generated by the supplied value versus market yields observed in the marketplace. We also compare yields indicated by the provided values to appropriate benchmark yields and review for values that are unchanged or that reflect an unanticipated variation as compared to prior period values. We utilize a primary pricing service for each security type and compare provided information for consistency with alternate pricing services, known market data and information from our own trades, considering both values and valuation trends. We also review weekly trades versus the prices supplied by the services. If a supplied value appears unreasonable, we discuss the valuation in question with the pricing service and make adjustments if deemed necessary. Historically our review has not resulted in any material changes to the values supplied by the pricing services. The pricing services do not provide a fair value unless an exchange-traded price or multiple observable inputs are available. As a result, the pricing services may provide a fair value for a security in some periods but not others, depending upon the level of recent market activity for the security or comparable securities.\nLevel 1 Investments\nFair values for a majority of our equity securities and portions of our corporate debt, short-term and convertible securities are determined using exchange-traded prices. There is little judgment involved when fair value is determined using an exchange-traded price. In accordance with GAAP, we classify securities valued using an exchange-traded price as Level 1 securities.\nLevel 2 Investments\nMost fixed income securities do not trade daily; thus, exchange-traded prices are generally not available for these securities. However, market information (often referred to as observable inputs or market data, including but not limited to, last reported trade, non-binding broker quotes, bids, benchmark yield curves, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, offers and recent data regarding assumed prepayment speeds, cash flow and loan performance data) is available for most of our fixed income securities. We determine fair value for a large portion of our fixed income securities using available market information. In accordance with GAAP, we classify securities valued based on multiple market observable inputs as Level 2 securities.\nLevel 3 Investments\nWhen a pricing service does not provide a value for one of our fixed maturity securities, management estimates fair value using either a single non-binding broker quote or pricing models that utilize market based assumptions which have limited observable inputs. The process involves significant judgment in selecting the appropriate data and modeling techniques to use in the valuation process. In accordance with GAAP, we classify securities valued using limited observable inputs as Level 3 securities.\nFair Values Not Categorized\nWe hold interests in certain investment funds, primarily LPs/LLCs, which measure fund assets at fair value on a recurring basis and provide us with a NAV for our interest. As a practical expedient, we consider the NAV provided to approximate the fair value of the interest. In accordance with GAAP, we do not categorize these investments within the fair value hierarchy.\nNonrecurring Fair Value Measurements\nWe measure the fair value of certain assets on a nonrecurring basis when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. These assets include investments carried principally at cost, investments in tax credit partnerships, fixed assets, goodwill and other intangible assets. These assets would also include any equity method investments that do not provide a NAV.\nInvestments - Other Valuation Methodologies\nCertain of our investments, in accordance with GAAP for the type of investment, are measured using methodologies other than fair value. At December 31, 2019, these investments represented approximately 5% of total investments, and are detailed in the following table. Additional information about these investments is provided in Notes 2 and 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>Carrying Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>GAAP Measurement Method\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other investments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, principally FHLB capital stock\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Principally Cost\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment in unconsolidated subsidiaries:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments in tax credit partnerships\n</td> <td>48.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Equity\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity method investments, primarily LPs/LLCs\n</td> <td>39.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Equity\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>88.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BOLI\n</td> <td>66.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cash surrender value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investments - Other valuation methodologies\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>157.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther-than-temporary Impairments\nWe evaluate our available-for-sale investment securities on at least a quarterly basis for the purpose of determining whether declines in fair value below recorded cost basis represent OTTI. We consider an OTTI to have occurred:\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>if there is intent to sell the security;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>if it is more likely than not that the security will be required to be sold before full recovery of its amortized cost basis; or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>if the entire amortized basis of the security is not expected to be recovered.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The assessment of whether the amortized cost basis of a security, particularly an asset-backed debt security, is expected to be recovered requires management to make assumptions regarding various matters affecting future cash flows. The choice of assumptions is subjective and requires the use of judgment. Actual credit losses experienced in future periods may differ from management's estimates of those credit losses. Methodologies used to estimate the present value of expected cash flows are:\nFor non-structured fixed maturities (obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions and corporate debt) the estimate of expected cash flows is determined by projecting a recovery value and a recovery time frame and assessing whether further principal and interest will be received. We consider various factors in projecting recovery values and recovery time frames, including the following:\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>third-party research and credit rating reports;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the current credit standing of the issuer, including credit rating downgrades, whether before or after the balance sheet date;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the extent to which the decline in fair value is attributable to credit risk specifically associated with the security or its issuer;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>internal assessments and the assessments of external portfolio managers regarding specific circumstances surrounding an investment, which indicate the investment is more or less likely to recover its amortized cost than other investments with a similar structure;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>for asset-backed securities, the origination date of the underlying loans, the remaining average life, the probability that credit performance of the underlying loans will deteriorate in the future and our assessment of the quality of the collateral underlying the loan;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> For structured securities (primarily asset-backed securities), management estimates the present value of the security's cash flows using the effective yield of the security at the date of acquisition (or the most recent implied rate used to accrete the security if the implied rate has changed as a result of a previous impairment or changes in expected cash flows). We consider the most recently available six month averages of the levels of delinquencies, defaults, severities and prepayments for the collateral (loans) underlying the securitization or, if historical data is not available, sector based assumptions to estimate expected future cash flows of these securities.\nExclusive of securities where there is an intent to sell or where it is not more likely than not that the security will be required to be sold before recovery of its amortized cost basis, OTTI for debt securities is separated into a credit component and a non-credit component. The credit component of an OTTI is the difference between the security's amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows, while the non-credit component is the remaining difference between the security's fair value and the present value of expected future cash flows. The credit component of the OTTI is recognized in earnings while the non-credit component is recognized in OCI.\nInvestments in tax credit partnerships are evaluated for OTTI by considering both qualitative and quantitative factors. These factors include, but are not limited to:\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our ability and intent to hold the investment until the recovery of its carrying value; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>in situations where there was not a previous OTTI for the investment, whether the current expected cash flows from the investment, primarily tax benefits, are less than those expected at the time the investment was acquired due to various factors, such as a change in the statutory tax rate; or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>in situations where there was a previous OTTI for the investment, whether the expected cash flows from the investment at the time of the OTTI, primarily tax benefits, are less than its current carrying value.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Investments which are accounted for under the equity method are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment might not be recoverable. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, evidence of the inability to recover the carrying value of the investment, the inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying value of the investment or the current fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value.\nWe recognize OTTI, exclusive of non-credit OTTI, in earnings as a part of net realized investment gains (losses). In subsequent periods, any measurement of gain, loss or impairment is based on the revised amortized basis of the security. Non-credit OTTI on debt securities and declines in fair value of available-for-sale securities not considered to be other-than-temporary are recognized in OCI.\nAsset-backed debt securities that have been impaired due to credit reasons or are below investment grade quality are accounted for under the effective yield method. Under the effective yield method, estimates of cash flows expected over the life of asset-backed securities are used to recognize income on the investment balance for subsequent accounting periods.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nPolicy acquisition costs (primarily commissions, premium taxes and underwriting salaries) which are directly related to the successful acquisition of new and renewal premiums are capitalized as DPAC and charged to expense, net of ceding commissions earned, as the related premium revenue is recognized. We evaluate the recoverability of our DPAC typically at the segment level each reporting period or in a manner that is consistent with the way we manage our business. Any amounts estimated to be unrecoverable are charged to expense in the current period.\nAs part of our evaluation of the recoverability of DPAC, we also evaluate our unearned premiums for premium deficiencies. A premium deficiency is recognized if the sum of anticipated losses and loss adjustment expenses, unamortized DPAC and maintenance costs, net of anticipated investment income, exceeds the related unearned premium. If a premium deficiency is identified, the associated DPAC is written off, and a PDR is recorded for the excess deficiency as a component of net losses and loss adjustment expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income and as a\ncomponent of the reserve for losses on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. For the year ended December 31, 2019, a nominal amount of DPAC was charged to expense as it was determined to be unrecoverable, and a $9.2 million PDR was established in our Specialty P&C segment related to a large national healthcare account. See further discussion on the PDR in the Segment Operating Results - Specialty Property & Casualty section that follows. No amounts were determined to be unrecoverable for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nDeferred Taxes\nDeferred federal income taxes arise from the recognition of temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities determined for financial reporting purposes and the basis determined for income tax purposes. Our temporary differences principally relate to our loss reserves, unearned and advanced premiums, DPAC, compensation related items, unrealized investment gains (losses) and basis differences on fixed assets, intangible assets and operating leases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such benefits are realized. We review our deferred tax assets quarterly for impairment. If we determine that it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management is required to make certain judgments and assumptions about our future operations based on historical experience and information as of the measurement period regarding reversal of existing temporary differences, carryback capacity, future taxable income (including its capital and operating characteristics) and tax planning strategies.\nA valuation allowance was established in a prior year against the deferred tax asset related to the NOL carryforwards for the U.K. operations as management concluded that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We also established a valuation allowance in a prior year against the deferred tax assets of certain SPCs at our recently formed wholly owned Cayman Islands reinsurance subsidiary, Inova Re. Due to the limited operations of these recently formed SPCs, management concluded that a valuation allowance was required. As of December 31, 2019, management concluded that a valuation allowance was still required against the deferred tax assets related to the NOL carryforwards for the U.K. operations and against the deferred tax assets of certain SPCs at Inova Re. See further discussion in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act\nThe TCJA introduced a minimum tax on payments made to related foreign entities referred to as the BEAT. The BEAT is imposed by adding back into the U.S. tax base any base erosion payment made by the U.S. taxpayer to a related foreign entity and applying a minimum tax rate to this newly calculated modified taxable income. Base erosion payments represent any amount paid or accrued by the U.S. taxpayer to a related foreign entity for which a deduction is allowed. Premiums we cede to the SPCs at Inova Re, one of our wholly owned Cayman Islands reinsurance subsidiaries, do not fall within the scope of base erosion payments as the SPCs at Inova Re intend to elect to be taxed as U.S. taxpayers. However, premiums that we cede to any active SPC at our other wholly owned Cayman Islands reinsurance subsidiary, Eastern Re, fall within the scope of base erosion payments and therefore could be significantly impacted by the BEAT. We have evaluated our exposure to the BEAT and have concluded that our expected outbound deductible payments to related foreign entities are below the threshold for application of the BEAT; therefore, we have not recognized any incremental tax expense for the BEAT provision of the TCJA for the year ended December 31, 2019. See further discussion on our Cayman Islands SPC operations in the Segment Operating Results - Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance section that follows.\nThe TCJA also requires a U.S. shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation to include its GILTI in U.S. taxable income. The GILTI amount is based on the U.S. shareholder's aggregate share of the gross income of the controlled foreign corporation reduced by certain exceptions and a net deemed tangible income return. The net deemed tangible income return is based on the controlled foreign corporation's basis in the tangible depreciable business property. Cell rental fee income earned by Inova Re and Eastern Re fall within the scope of the GILTI provisions of the TCJA. We have evaluated the new GILTI provisions of the TCJA and we have made an accounting policy election to treat the taxes due on inclusions of GILTI in U.S. taxable income as a current period expense when incurred. We recognized a nominal amount of tax expense for the GILTI provision of the TCJA during year ended December 31, 2019.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nWe evaluate tax positions taken on tax returns and recognize positions in our financial statements when it is more likely than not that we will sustain the position upon resolution with a taxing authority. If recognized, the benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% probability of being realized. We review uncertain tax positions each period, considering changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law, and make adjustments as we consider necessary. Adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits may\naffect our income tax expense, and settlement of uncertain tax positions may require the use of cash. Other than differences related to timing, no significant adjustments were considered necessary during 2019 or 2018. At December 31, 2019, our liability for unrecognized tax benefits approximated $5.1 million.\nGoodwill\nImpairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level, which is consistent with our reportable segments identified in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Of the five reporting units, three have goodwill - Specialty P&C, Workers' Compensation Insurance and Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually on October 1, upon the occurrence of certain triggering events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate the fair value of goodwill may be impaired and immediately before and after a reorganization that affects the composition of one or more of our reporting units, if applicable.\nAnnual Goodwill Impairment Test\nWhen testing goodwill for impairment on our annual test date, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not, we are then required to perform the two-step quantitative impairment test; otherwise, no further analysis is required. We also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test.\nIn the first step of the two-step quantitative impairment test, the fair value of a reporting unit is determined using income and market approaches and is compared to its carrying value, as described above. The estimate of fair value derived from the income approach is based on the present value of expected future cash flows, including terminal value, utilizing a market based weighted average cost of capital determined separately for each reporting unit. The estimate of fair value derived from the market approach is based on earnings multiple data derived from market information. The determination of fair value involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates, operating margins, capital expenditures, working capital requirements, tax rates, terminal growth rates, discount rates, comparable public companies and synergistic benefits available to market participants. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units to determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit. To corroborate the reporting units' valuation, we perform a reconciliation of the estimate of the aggregate fair value of the reporting units to ProAssurance's market capitalization, including consideration of a control premium. Because not all of our reporting units have goodwill, we make certain assumptions regarding the fair value of our other reporting units in reconciling to our market capitalization.\nIf the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment of goodwill, if any. In the second step, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\nAs of the most recent goodwill impairment test performed on October 1, 2019, we elected to perform a qualitative goodwill impairment test for our Specialty P&C, Workers' Compensation Insurance and Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance reporting units. Each of these reporting units have historically had an excess of fair value over book value and based on current operations are expected to continue to do so; therefore, our annual impairment test for these reporting units was performed qualitatively. In applying the qualitative approach, management considered macroeconomic factors, industry and market conditions, cost factors that could have a negative impact on the reporting units, actual financial performance of the reporting units versus expectations and management's future business expectations. As a result of the qualitative assessments, management concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of our three reporting units that have goodwill was less than the carrying value of each reporting unit as of the testing date; therefore, no further impairment testing was required. No goodwill impairment was recorded in 2019, 2018 or 2017.\nIntangibles\nIntangible assets with definite lives are amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset. Amortizable intangible assets primarily consist of agency and policyholder relationships, renewal rights and trade names. Intangible assets with an indefinite life, primarily state licenses, are not amortized. Intangible assets are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or upon the occurrence of certain triggering events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate the fair value of the asset may be impaired. Additional information regarding our intangible assets is included in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLeases\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, we adopted ASU 2016-02, which requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions in applying the requirements of this new guidance. We are involved in a number of leases, primarily for office facilities. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at the inception date of the contract and classify all leases as either financing or operating. As of December 31, 2019, all of our leases were classified as operating. Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized as of the lease commencement date based on the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted over the term of the lease using a discount rate determined based on information available as of the commencement date. The ROU asset represents the right to use the underlying asset (office space) for the lease term. As the majority of our lessors do not provide an implicit discount rate, we use our collateralized incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of remaining lease payments. For leases entered into or reassessed after the adoption of ASU 2016-02, we account for lease and non-lease components of a contract as a single lease component.\nWe evaluate our operating lease ROU assets for impairment at the asset group level whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of an asset group, which includes the operating lease ROU asset and the related operating lease liability, is not recoverable if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group over the life of the primary asset in the asset group. That assessment is based on the carrying amount of the asset group, including the operating lease ROU asset and the related operating lease liability, at the date it is tested for recoverability and an impairment loss is measured and recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. Any impairment loss is allocated to each asset in the asset group, including the operating ROU asset.\nWhen a lease of an office facility is to be abandoned and will not be subleased, we first evaluate whether or not the operating lease ROU asset's inclusion in an existing asset group continues to be appropriate and if the commitment to abandon the lease constitutes a change in circumstances requiring the operating lease ROU asset, or the larger asset group, to be tested for impairment. If an impairment test is required, it is performed in the same manner as discussed above. Any remaining carrying value of the operating lease ROU asset is amortized from the date we commit to a plan to abandon the lease to the expected date that we will cease to use the leased property. Leases to be abandoned in which we have the intent or practical ability to sublease continue to be accounted for under a held and use model, with no change to the amortization period of the operating lease ROU asset, and are evaluated for impairment as a separate asset group at the date the sublease is executed.\nAdditional information regarding our leases is included in Note 1 and Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAudit Premium\nWorkers' compensation premiums are determined based upon the payroll of the insured, respective premium rates and, where applicable, an experience-based modification factor. An audit of the policyholders' records is conducted after policy expiration to make a final determination of applicable premiums. Audit premium due from or due to a policyholder as a result of an audit is reflected in net premiums written and earned when billed. We track, by policy, the amount of additional premium billed in final audit invoices as a percentage of payroll exposure and use this information to estimate the probable additional amount of EBUB premium as of the balance sheet date. We include changes to the EBUB premium estimate in net premiums written and earned in the period recognized.\nLloyd's Premium Estimates\nFor certain insurance policies and reinsurance contracts written in our Lloyd's Syndicates segment, premiums are initially recognized based upon estimates of ultimate premium. Estimated ultimate premium consists primarily of premium written under delegated underwriting authority arrangements, which consist primarily of binding authorities, and certain assumed reinsurance agreements. These estimates of ultimate premium are judgmental and are dependent upon certain assumptions, including historical premium trends for similar agreements. As reports are received from programs, ultimate premium estimates are revised, if necessary, with changes reflected in current operations.\nAccounting Changes\nWe did not have any change in accounting estimate or policy that had a material effect on our results of operations or financial position during 2019. We are not aware of any accounting changes not yet adopted as of December 31, 2019 that would have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional detail regarding accounting changes not yet adopted.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources and Financial Condition\nOverview\nProAssurance Corporation is a holding company and is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. As a holding company, our principal source of external revenue is our investment revenues. In addition, dividends from our operating subsidiaries represent a significant source of funds for our obligations, including debt service and shareholder dividends. We also charge our operating subsidiaries within our Specialty P&C and Workers' Compensation Insurance segments a management fee based on the extent to which services are provided to the subsidiary and the amount of gross premium written by the subsidiary. At December 31, 2019, we held cash and liquid investments of approximately $280 million outside our insurance subsidiaries that were available for use without regulatory approval or other restriction, of which $17 million was used to pay shareholder dividends in January 2020. We also have $250 million in permitted borrowings under our Revolving Credit Agreement and an accordion feature available which, if subscribed successfully, would allow another $50 million in available funds as discussed in this section under the heading \"Debt.\" As of February 14, 2020, no borrowings were outstanding under our Revolving Credit Agreement.\nDuring 2019, our operating subsidiaries paid dividends to us of approximately $123 million, including extraordinary dividends from our insurance subsidiaries of approximately $20 million. Our insurance subsidiaries, in the aggregate, are permitted to pay dividends of approximately $88 million over the course of 2020 without prior approval of state insurance regulators. However, the payment of any dividend requires prior notice to the insurance regulator in the state of domicile, and the regulator may reduce or prevent the dividend if, in its judgment, payment of the dividend would have an adverse effect on the surplus of the insurance subsidiary. We make the decision to pay dividends from an insurance subsidiary based on the capital needs of that subsidiary and may pay less than the permitted dividend or may also request permission to pay an additional amount (an extraordinary dividend).\nCash Flows\nCash flows between periods compare as follows:\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided (used) by:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>148,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>177,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(29,099\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>50,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>214,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(164,375\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>(103,790\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(446,186\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>342,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(54,024\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>148,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided (used) by:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>177,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>173,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>214,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>(446,186\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(356,515\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(89,671\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(54,024\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(71,172\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe principal components of our operating cash flows are the excess of premiums collected and net investment income over losses paid and operating costs, including income taxes. Timing delays exist between the collection of premiums and the payment of losses associated with the premiums. Premiums are generally collected within the twelve-month period after the policy is written, while our claim payments are generally paid over a more extended period of time. Likewise, timing delays exist between the payment of claims and the collection of any associated reinsurance recoveries.\nThe decrease in operating cash flows in 2019 as compared to 2018 of $29.1 million was primarily due to an increase in paid losses of $30.2 million, a decrease in cash received from investment income of $9.8 million and an increase in cash paid for operating expenses of $8.1 million. The increase in paid losses was driven by our Specialty P&C and Workers' Compensation Insurance segments. The increase in paid losses in our Specialty P&C segment primarily reflected higher average claims payments in 2019 as compared to 2018 and the increase in paid losses in our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment primarily reflected the timing of loss payments between periods. The decrease in cash received from investment income was primarily due to a decline in distributed earnings from our unconsolidated subsidiaries. The increase in cash paid for operating expenses was driven by an increase in brokerage expenses in our Lloyd's Syndicates segment from the continuing\ngrowth of Syndicate 6131 as well as an increase in fees associated with a data analytics services agreement entered into during the fourth quarter of 2018 in our Specialty P&C segment. In addition, the decrease in operating cash flows reflected a decrease in net cash received of $3.0 million associated with the cash settlement from the commutation of the 2017 and 2016 calendar year quota share reinsurance arrangements between our Specialty P&C segment and Syndicate 1729 due to the reduction in premiums ceded to Syndicate 1729. The decrease in operating cash flows was partially offset by an increase in net premium receipts of $19.0 million and a decrease in estimated tax payments of $3.0 million. The increase in net premium receipts was primarily due to the growth in written premium in our Lloyd's Syndicates and Specialty P&C segments.\nThe increase in operating cash flows in 2018 as compared to 2017 of $3.9 million was primarily due to an increase in premium receipts of $60.8 million, a decrease in 2018 estimated tax payments as compared to 2017 of $11.5 million and a decrease in cash paid for operating expenses of $1.6 million, partially offset by an increase in paid losses of $64.3 million and a decrease in cash received from investment income of $5.1 million. The increase in premium receipts was driven by our Specialty P&C segment, primarily due to premiums received from a loss portfolio transfer entered into during the second quarter of 2018 and, to a lesser extent, our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment, primarily due to premiums received related to the third quarter 2017 acquisition of the Great Falls book of business. The decrease in 2018 estimated tax payments was primarily due to the lower statutory federal income tax rate in 2018 as compared to 2017. The increase in paid losses was driven by all of our operating segments, particularly in our Specialty P&C segment, primarily due to the timing of loss payments between periods, and our Lloyd's Syndicates segment, primarily due to 2017 storm-related losses which were paid in 2018. The decrease in cash paid for operating expenses was primarily due to a decrease in compensation related costs, largely offset by an increase in cash paid for operating expenses in our Lloyd's Syndicates segment primarily due to the start-up of Syndicate 6131. The decrease in cash received from investment income was primarily due to a reduction in interest received on our fixed maturities portfolio resulting from lower average balances.\nWe manage our investing cash flows to ensure that we will have sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations, taking into consideration the timing of cash flows from our investments, including interest payments, dividends and principal payments, as well as the expected cash flows to be generated by our operations as discussed in this section under the heading \"Investing Activities and Related Cash Flows.\"\nOur financing cash flows are primarily composed of dividend payments and borrowings and repayments under our Revolving Credit Agreement. See further discussion of our financing activities in this section under \"Financing Activities and Related Cash Flows.\"\nOperating Activities and Related Cash Flows\nLosses\nThe following table, known as the Analysis of Reserve Development, presents information over the preceding ten years regarding the payment of our losses as well as changes to (the development of) our estimates of losses during that time period. As noted in the table, we have completed various acquisitions over the ten year period which have affected original and re-estimated gross and net reserve balances as well as loss payments.\nThe table includes losses on both a direct and an assumed basis and is net of anticipated reinsurance recoverables. The gross liability for losses before reinsurance, as shown on the balance sheet, and the reconciliation of that gross liability to amounts net of reinsurance are reflected below the table. We do not discount our reserve for losses to present value. Information presented in the table is cumulative and, accordingly, each amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts for prior years. The table presents the development of our balance sheet reserve for losses; it does not present accident year or policy year development data. Conditions and trends that have affected the development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur in the future. Accordingly, it is not appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based on this table.\nThe following may be helpful in understanding the Analysis of Reserve Development:\nTable

Our consolidated gross reserve for losses on a GAAP basis exceeds the combined gross reserves of our insurance subsidiaries on a statutory basis by approximately $0.2 billion, which is principally due to the portion of the GAAP reserve for losses that is reflected for statutory accounting purposes as unearned premiums. These unearned premiums are applicable to extended reporting endorsements ( tail\u201d coverage) issued without a premium charge upon death, disability or retirement of an insured who meets certain qualifications.\nReinsurance\nWithin our Specialty P&C segment, we use insurance and reinsurance (collectively, reinsurance\u201d) to provide capacity to write larger limits of liability, to provide reimbursement for losses incurred under the higher limit coverages we offer and to provide protection against losses in excess of policy limits. Within our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment, we use reinsurance to reduce our net liability on individual risks, to mitigate the effect of significant loss occurrences (including catastrophic events), to stabilize underwriting results and to increase underwriting capacity by decreasing leverage. In both our Specialty P&C and Workers' Compensation Insurance segments, we use reinsurance in risk sharing arrangements to align our objectives with those of our strategic business partners and to provide custom insurance solutions for large customer groups. The purchase of reinsurance does not relieve us from the ultimate risk on our policies; however, it does provide reimbursement for certain losses we pay. We pay our reinsurers a premium in exchange for reinsurance of the risk. In certain of our excess of loss arrangements, the premium due to the reinsurer is determined by the loss experience of the business reinsured, subject to certain minimum and maximum amounts. Until all loss amounts are known, we estimate the premium due to the reinsurer. Changes to the estimate of premium owed under reinsurance agreements related to prior periods are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs and can have a significant effect on net premiums earned.\nWe offer alternative market solutions whereby we cede certain premiums from our Workers' Compensation Insurance and Specialty P&C segments to either the SPCs at Inova Re or Eastern Re, our Cayman Islands reinsurance subsidiaries which are reported in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment, or, to a limited extent, an unaffiliated captive insurer. During 2019 and 2018, we wrote total alternative market premium of approximately $90.0 million and $90.2 million, respectively. The majority of these policies ($86.7 million and $85.1 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively) are reinsured to the SPCs at Inova Re or Eastern Re, net of a ceding commission. Each SPC at Inova Re and Eastern Re is owned, fully or in part, by an agency, group or association, and the operating results of the SPCs are due to the participants of that cell. We participate to a varying\ndegree in the results of selected SPCs and, for the SPCs in which we participate, our participation interest ranges from a low of 20% to a high of 85%. SPC operating results due to external cell participants are reflected as an SPC dividend expense (income) in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment. See further discussion on our SPC operations in the Segment Operating Results - Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance section that follows. The alternative market workers' compensation policies are ceded from our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment to the SPCs under 100% quota share reinsurance agreements. The alternative market professional liability policies are ceded from our Specialty P&C segment to the SPCs under either excess of loss or quota share reinsurance agreements, depending on the structure of the individual program. The nominal portion of the risk that is not ceded to an SPC is retained in our Specialty P&C segment and may also be reinsured under our standard healthcare professional liability reinsurance program, depending on the policy limits provided. The remaining premium written in our alternative market business of $2.4 million and $4.5 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, was 100% ceded to a single unaffiliated captive insurer in 2019 and to two unaffiliated captive insurers in 2018.\nFor all of our segments, we make a determination of the amount of insurance risk we choose to retain based upon numerous factors, including our risk tolerance and the capital we have to support it, the price and availability of reinsurance, the volume of business, our level of experience with a particular set of claims and our analysis of the potential underwriting results. We purchase excess of loss reinsurance to limit the amount of risk we retain and we do so from a number of companies to mitigate concentrations of credit risk. We utilize reinsurance brokers to assist us in the placement of these reinsurance programs and in the analysis of the credit quality of our reinsurers. The determination of which reinsurers we choose to do business with is based upon an evaluation of their then current financial strength, rating and stability. However, the financial strength of our reinsurers and their corresponding ability to pay us may change in the future due to forces or events we cannot control or anticipate. As of December 31, 2019, there is no reinsurer, on an individual basis, for which our recoverables for both paid and unpaid claims (net of amounts due to the reinsurer) and our prepaid balances are aggregately $40 million or more.\nExcess of Loss Reinsurance Agreements\nWe generally reinsure risks under treaties (our excess of loss reinsurance agreements) pursuant to which the reinsurers agree to assume all or a portion of all risks that we insure above our individual risk retention levels, up to the maximum individual limits offered. These agreements are negotiated and renewed annually. Renewal dates for our healthcare professional liability, medical technology liability and workers' compensation treaties are October 1, January 1 and May 1, respectively. Our healthcare professional liability treaty renewed October 1, 2019 at a higher rate than the previous agreement, partially offset by a lower intermediary compensation rate. Our medical technology liability treaty renewed January 1, 2020 at a lower rate than the previous agreement. Our workers' compensation treaty renewed May 1, 2019 at a lower rate than the previous agreement; however, the lower rate reflects the addition of an AAD and the elimination of the return premium component of the contract. The significant coverages provided by our current excess of loss reinsurance agreements are detailed in the following table.\nExcess of Loss Reinsurance Agreements\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Healthcare\nProfessional Liability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Medical Technology &\nLife Sciences Products\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Workers'\nCompensation - Traditional\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Historically, retention has ranged from 5% to 32.5%.\n(2) Historically, retention has been as high as $2M.\n(3) Includes an AAD where retention is the greater of $3.9M or 2.1% of subject premium in annual losses otherwise recoverable in excess of the $500k retention per loss occurrence.\nLarge healthcare professional liability risks that are above the limits of our basic reinsurance treaties are reinsured on a facultative basis, whereby the reinsurer agrees to insure a particular risk up to a designated limit. We also have in place a number of risk sharing arrangements that apply to the first $1 million of losses for certain large healthcare systems and other insurance entities, as well as with certain insurance agencies that produce business for us.\nOther Reinsurance Arrangements\nFor the workers' compensation business ceded to Inova Re and Eastern Re, each SPC has in place its own reinsurance arrangements; which are illustrated in the following table.\nSegregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Per Occurrence Coverage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Aggregate Coverage\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The attachment point is based on a percentage of written premium within individual cells (average is 89%) and varies by cell.\nEach SPC has participants and the profit or loss of each cell accrues fully to these cell participants. As previously discussed, we participate in certain SPCs to a varying degree. Each SPC maintains a loss fund initially equal to the difference between premium assumed by the cell and the ceding commission. The external participants of each cell provide collateral, typically in the form of a letter of credit, to us that is initially equal to the difference between the loss fund of the SPC (amount of funds available to pay losses after deduction of ceding commission) and the aggregate attachment point of the reinsurance. Over time, an SPC's retained profits are considered in the determination of the collateral amount required to be provided by the cell's external participants.\nWithin our Lloyd's Syndicates segment, Syndicate 1729 utilizes reinsurance to provide capacity to write larger limits of liability on individual risks, to provide protection against catastrophic loss and to provide protection against losses in excess of policy limits. The level of reinsurance that Syndicate 1729 purchases is dependent on a number of factors, including its underwriting risk appetite for catastrophic exposure, the specific risks inherent in each line or class of business written and the pricing, coverage and terms and conditions available from the reinsurance market. Reinsurance protection by line of business is as follows:\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Reinsurance is utilized on a per risk basis for the property insurance and casualty coverages in order to mitigate risk volatility.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Catastrophic protection is utilized on both our property insurance and casualty coverages to protect against losses in excess of policy limits as well as natural catastrophes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Both quota share reinsurance and excess of loss reinsurance are utilized to manage the net loss exposure on our property reinsurance coverages.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Property umbrella excess of loss reinsurance is utilized for peak catastrophe and frequency of catastrophe exposures.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>External excess of loss reinsurance is utilized by Syndicate 1729 to manage the net loss exposure on the specialty property and contingency coverages ceded to Syndicate 6131 (see further discussion in Segment Operating Results - Lloyd's Syndicates section that follows).\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Syndicate 1729 may still be exposed to losses that exceed the level of reinsurance purchased as well as to reinstatement premiums triggered by losses exceeding specified levels. Cash demands on Syndicate 1729 can vary significantly depending on\nthe nature and intensity of a loss event. For significant reinsured catastrophe losses, the inability or unwillingness of the reinsurer to make timely payments under the terms of the reinsurance agreement could have an adverse effect on Syndicate 1729's liquidity.\nLitigation\nWe are involved in various legal actions related to insurance policies and claims handling including, but not limited to, claims asserted against us by policyholders. These types of legal actions arise in the ordinary course of business and, in accordance with GAAP for insurance entities, are generally considered as a part of our loss reserving process, which is described in detail in our Critical Accounting Estimates section under the heading \"Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses.\" We also have other direct actions against the Company unrelated to our claims activity which we evaluate and account for as a part of our other liabilities. For these corporate legal actions, we evaluate each case separately and establish what we believe is an appropriate reserve based on GAAP guidance related to contingent liabilities. As of December 31, 2019 there were no material reserves established for corporate legal actions.\nInvesting Activities and Related Cash Flows\nOur investments at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 are comprised as follows:\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>Carrying\nValue\n</td> <td>% of Total Investment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Carrying\nValue\n</td> <td>% of Total Investment\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed maturities, available for sale:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Treasury obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Government-sponsored enterprise obligations\n</td> <td>17,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>State and municipal bonds\n</td> <td>296,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>293,772\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate debt\n</td> <td>1,340,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,223,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential mortgage-backed securities\n</td> <td>208,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>181,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial mortgage-backed securities\n</td> <td>80,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other asset-backed securities\n</td> <td>236,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>195,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total fixed maturities, available for sale\n</td> <td>2,288,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,093,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed maturities, trading\n</td> <td>47,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total fixed maturities\n</td> <td>2,336,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,131,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity investments\n</td> <td>250,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>442,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term investments\n</td> <td>339,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>308,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BOLI\n</td> <td>66,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment in unconsolidated subsidiaries\n</td> <td>358,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>367,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other investments\n</td> <td>38,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,390,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,349,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2019, 99% of our investments in available-for-sale fixed maturity securities were rated, and the average rating was A+.

In addition to the interest and dividends we will receive, we anticipate that between $30 million and $80 million of our investments will mature (or be paid down) each quarter over the next twelve months and become available, if needed, to meet our cash flow requirements. The primary outflow of cash at our insurance subsidiaries is related to paid losses and operating costs, including income taxes. The payment of individual claims cannot be predicted with certainty; therefore, we rely upon the history of paid claims in estimating the timing of future claims payments. To the extent that we may have an unanticipated shortfall in cash, we may either liquidate securities or borrow funds under existing borrowing arrangements through our Revolving Credit Agreement and the FHLB system. As of February 14, 2020, $300 million could be made available for use through our Revolving Credit Agreement, as discussed in this section under the heading \"Debt.\" Given the duration of our investments, we do not foresee a shortfall that would require us to meet operating cash needs through additional borrowings. Additional information regarding our Revolving Credit Agreement is detailed in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAt December 31, 2019, our FAL was comprised of fixed maturity securities with a fair value of $129.9 million and cash and cash equivalents of $7.2 million deposited with Lloyd's. See further discussion in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur investment portfolio continues to be primarily composed of high quality fixed income securities with approximately 94% of our fixed maturities being investment grade securities as determined by national rating agencies. The weighted average effective duration of our fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2019 was 2.96 years; the weighted average effective duration of our fixed maturity securities combined with our short-term securities was 2.58 years.\nThe carrying value and unfunded commitments for certain of our investments were as follows:\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Carrying Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands, except expected funding period)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Unfunded Commitment\n</td> <td>Expected funding period in years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Qualified affordable housing project tax credit partnerships (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Historic tax credit partnerships (2)\n</td> <td>2,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other investments, primarily investment fund LPs/LLCs\n</td> <td>310,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>298,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>358,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>367,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>165,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) The carrying value reflects our total commitments (both funded and unfunded) to the partnerships, less any amortization, since our initial investment.

We manage our risk through diversification of asset class and geographic location. At December 31, 2019, we had investments in 37 separate investment funds with a total carrying value of $310.3 million which represented approximately 9% of our total investments. We review and monitor the performance of these investments on a quarterly basis.\nBusiness Combinations and Ventures\nThere were no business combinations during the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nFinancing Activities and Related Cash Flows\nTreasury Shares\nTreasury share activity for 2019, 2018 and 2017 was as follows:\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Treasury shares at the beginning of the period\n</td> <td>9,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shares reissued, primarily those reissued pursuant to the ProAssurance 2011 Employee Stock Ownership Plan, had a fair value of approximately $1 million in both 2019 and 2018 and approximately $2 million in 2017\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Treasury shares at the end of the period\n</td> <td>9,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe did not repurchase any common shares subsequent to December 31, 2019 and as of February 14, 2020 our remaining Board authorization was approximately $110 million.\nShareholder Dividends\nOur Board declared cash dividends during 2019, 2018 and 2017 as follows:\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Quarterly Cash Dividends Declared, per Share\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth Quarter - Special dividend\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.69\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEach dividend was paid in the month following the quarter in which it was declared. Cash dividends totaling $93 million, $316 million and $315 million were paid during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Any decision to pay future cash dividends is subject to the Board's final determination after a comprehensive review of financial performance, future expectations and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.\nDebt\nAt December 31, 2019, our debt included $250 million of outstanding unsecured senior notes. The notes bear interest at 5.3% annually and are due in 2023 although they may be redeemed in whole or part prior to maturity. There are no financial covenants associated with these notes.\nWe have a Revolving Credit Agreement which may be used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, short-term working capital, share repurchases as authorized by the Board and support for other activities. On November 7, 2019, we executed an amendment to our Revolving Credit Agreement which extended its expiration from June 2020 to November 2024 and increased the permitted borrowings from $200 million to $250 million. In addition to the permitted borrowings of $250 million, our Revolving Credit Agreement has available a $50 million accordion feature, which, if successfully subscribed, would expand permitted borrowings up to $300 million. At December 31, 2019, there were no outstanding borrowings on our Revolving Credit Agreement and we are in compliance with the financial covenants of the Revolving Credit Agreement.\nWe have Mortgage Loans with one lender in connection with the recapitalization of two office buildings, which mature in December 2027. The Mortgage Loans accrue interest at three-month LIBOR plus 1.325% with principal and interest payable on a quarterly basis. At December 31, 2019, the outstanding balance of the Mortgage Loans was approximately $38 million and we are in compliance with the financial covenant of the Mortgage Loans.\nAdditional information regarding our debt is provided in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe utilize an interest rate cap agreement with a notional amount of $35 million to manage our exposure to increases in LIBOR on our Mortgage Loans. Per the interest rate cap agreement, we are entitled to receive cash payments if and when the three-month LIBOR exceeds 2.35%. Additional information on our interest rate cap agreement is provided in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTwo of our insurance subsidiaries are members of an FHLB. Through membership, those subsidiaries have access to secured cash advances which can be used for liquidity purposes or other operational needs. In order for us to use FHLB proceeds, regulatory approvals may be required depending on the nature of the transaction. To date, those subsidiaries have not materially utilized their membership for borrowing purposes.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements/Guarantees\nWe have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements/guarantees that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. See more information on our off-balance sheet arrangements in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nContractual Obligations\nWe believe that our operating cash flow and funds from our investment portfolio are adequate to meet our contractual obligations.\nA schedule of our non-cancellable contractual obligations at December 31, 2019 was as follows:\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Losses and loss adjustment expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,346,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>629,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>917,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>433,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>365,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt obligations including interest and fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>349,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>268,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funding commitments primarily related to non-public investment entities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>205,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>137,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,926,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>788,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,020,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>709,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>407,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe anticipated payout of losses and loss adjustment expenses is based upon our historical payout patterns. Both the timing and amount of these payments may vary from the payments indicated.\nAt December 31, 2019, there were no outstanding borrowings on our Revolving Credit Agreement; however, the above table includes unused commitment fees associated with our Revolving Credit Agreement as we presume the full unused facility will remain available through expiration of the agreement in November 2024. Additionally, we presume the current interest rate on our Mortgage Loans at December 31, 2019 will remain constant until maturity of the Mortgage Loans in December 2027. For more information regarding these agreements see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe are involved in a number of operating leases primarily for office facilities. Office facility leases have remaining lease terms ranging from one year to thirteen years. The above table includes the remaining future minimum lease payments including imputed interest for operating leases that had an initial or remaining non-cancellable lease term in excess of one year as of December 31, 2019. In addition, the above table excludes total future minimum lease payments of $1.5 million for an eleven year lease signed but not yet commenced as of December 31, 2019. Additional information regarding our leases is included in Note 1 and Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur funding commitments are primarily related to non-public investment entities but also include the unused commitment under our Syndicate Credit Agreement as we presume it will be fully advanced within the next year for purposes of the disclosure in the table above. The above table excludes a short-term loan commitment where we have agreed to advance funds on a 30 day basis. For more information regarding these agreements see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nResults of Operations - Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31,

See further discussion of these loss portfolio transfers in our Segment Operating Results - Specialty Property & Casualty section that follows. After removing the impacts of the 2019 and 2018 loss portfolio transfers, consolidated net premiums earned increased $52.6 million during 2019 as compared to 2018. All of our operating segments contributed to the remaining increase in consolidated net premiums earned, particularly our Specialty P&C segment due to the pro rata effect of an increase in the volume of written premium during the preceding twelve months, predominantly in our physicians and healthcare facilities lines of business, driven by an increase in renewal pricing.\nThe following table shows our consolidated net investment result:\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated subsidiaries\n</td> <td>(10,061\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19,009\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(212.4\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment result\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17,624\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.5\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in our consolidated net investment result in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily attributable to a decrease in earnings (loss) from our unconsolidated subsidiaries, somewhat offset by an increase in net investment income. Equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated subsidiaries includes our share of the operating results of interests we hold in certain LPs/LLCs as well as operating losses associated with our tax credit partnership investments, which are designed to generate returns in the form of tax credits and tax-deductible project operating losses. During 2019, the earnings generated from our LPs/LLCs did not exceed the operating losses recorded from our tax credit partnership investments resulting in an overall loss from investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries as compared to earnings from investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2018. The decrease in earnings generated from our LPs/LLCs in 2019 was driven by lower reported earnings from two LP investments, somewhat offset by lower operating losses from our tax credit partnership investments. The increase in net investment income in 2019 was primarily due to an increase in interest earned on our FAL in our Lloyd's Syndicate segment due to a higher average balance in 2019 as compared to 2018. Our FAL primarily includes investment-grade corporate debt securities deposited with Lloyd's.\nThe following table shows our total consolidated net realized investment gains (losses):\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net impairment losses recognized in earnings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(751\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(490\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(261\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53.3\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other net realized investment gains (losses)\n</td> <td>60,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(42,998\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>241.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized investment gains (losses)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(43,488\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>103,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>237.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2019, we recognized OTTI in earnings of $0.8 million and non-credit OTTI in OCI of $0.2 million, both of which related to three corporate bonds in the energy and consumer sectors.

performed by both internal and consulting actuaries during 2019 and 2018, we increased our current accident year net loss ratio in our Specialty P&C segment in both 2019 and 2018; however, the adjustment was greater in 2019 as compared to 2018 which accounted for 3.4 percentage points of the increase in our consolidated current accident year net loss ratio. This increase in 2019 was driven by increased reserve estimates for a large national healthcare account and, to a lesser extent, in our broader HCPL excess and surplus lines of business. In addition, the higher consolidated current accident year net loss ratio reflected changes to our reserve in our Specialty P&C segment related to DDR coverage endorsements as well as a PDR of $9.2 million, which accounted for 1.7 and 1.1 percentage points, respectively, of the increase. The PDR represents an estimated premium deficiency associated with the aforementioned large national healthcare account which is reflected as a component of current accident year net losses in 2019 (see further discussion in our Segment Operating Results - Specialty Property & Casualty section that follows). Furthermore, the increase in our consolidated current accident year net loss ratio also reflected a $10 million reserve that an SPC at Eastern Re established during 2019 associated with an assumed E&O liability policy in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment which accounted for 1.2 percentage points of the increase. We do not participate in the SPC that assumed this policy; therefore, these losses are the obligation of the external cell participants and are reflected in the SPC dividend expense (income), which is an offset to expenses, and thus has no effect on our consolidated net income or Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment net operating results for 2019 (see further discussion in our Segment Operating Results - Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance section that follows).\nIn both 2019 and 2018, our consolidated calendar year net loss ratio was lower than our consolidated current accident year net loss ratio due to the recognition of consolidated net favorable prior year reserve development, as shown in the previous table. Consolidated net favorable prior year reserve development in 2019 was lower than in 2018 driven by unfavorable development recognized in our Specialty P&C segment of $5.7 million in 2019 as compared to favorable development of $77.0 million recognized in 2018. The unfavorable development recognized in our Specialty P&C segment in 2019 was driven by $51.5 million of unfavorable prior year reserve development related to the previously mentioned large national healthcare account that has experienced losses far exceeding the assumptions we made when underwriting the account, beginning in 2016. Excluding the unfavorable development related to this account, our Specialty P&C segment recognized favorable prior year reserve development totaling $45.8 million in 2019.\nOur consolidated and segment underwriting expense ratios were as follows:\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting Expense Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated\n</td> <td>29.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specialty P&C\n</td> <td>24.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Workers' Compensation Insurance\n</td> <td>30.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance\n</td> <td>30.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lloyd's Syndicates\n</td> <td>43.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate*\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>*There are no net premiums earned associated with the Corporate segment.

Excluding the impact of the 2018 loss portfolio transfer, our consolidated underwriting expense ratio for 2019 was relatively unchanged as compared to 2018 driven by an increase in consolidated net premiums earned which outpaced the increase in consolidated DPAC amortization, offset by an increase operating expenses in our Specialty P&C segment driven by fees associated with a data analytics services agreement entered into during the fourth quarter of 2018.\nTaxes\nOur effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(28,804\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(57,829\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>200.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>(29,808\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18,032\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,776\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>39.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(46,053\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(4,587.0\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>103.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(62.1\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>165.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe recognized an income tax benefit in both 2019 and 2018; however, the comparability of our effective tax rates is impacted by the pre-tax loss recognized in 2019 as compared to pre-tax income recognized in 2018.\nOur effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were different from the statutory federal income tax rates in effect for each year primarily due to the recognition of a tax benefit from credits transferred to us from our tax credit partnership investments and, to a lesser extent, portions of our income that are exempt from federal income taxes. See further discussion, including other notable items during 2019 and 2018 in the Segment Operating Results - Corporate section that follows under the heading \"Taxes.\"\nOperating Ratio\nOur operating ratio is our combined ratio, less our investment income ratio.

The higher combined ratio in our Specialty P&C segment was driven by a higher current accident year net loss ratio and the recognition of net unfavorable development on prior accident year reserves. See previous discussion in this section under the heading \"Expenses\" and further discussion in our Segment Operating Results - Specialty Property & Casualty section that follows under the heading \"Losses.\"\nROE\nROE is calculated as net income divided by the average of beginning and ending shareholders' equity.

Segment operating results included the following:\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums written\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>495,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>494,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums earned\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>499,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>491,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>5,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net losses and loss adjustment expenses\n</td> <td>(532,485\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(384,431\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(148,054\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting, policy acquisition and operating expenses\n</td> <td>(120,310\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(112,419\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,891\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating results\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(147,941\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(148,722\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19,042.5\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss ratio\n</td> <td>106.7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting expense ratio\n</td> <td>24.1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs a result of actuarial analyses performed by both internal and consulting actuaries during 2019, we concluded that additional reserves were needed in our Specialty P&C segment. As such, we recorded $5.7 million of net unfavorable development on our prior accident year reserves and recorded a higher current accident year net loss ratio which resulted in a net loss ratio of 106.7% in 2019. Furthermore, net losses and loss adjustment expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 included a $9.2 million PDR which represents an estimated premium deficiency associated with the unearned premium related to a large national healthcare account. See further discussion that follows under the heading \"Losses.\"\nIn addition, segment operating results for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 included the effect of two separate loss portfolio transfers; one entered into during the third quarter of 2019 and one entered into during the second quarter of 2018. A loss portfolio transfer is a form of retroactive insurance coverage as we are assuming and accepting an entity's existing open and future claim liabilities through the transfer of the entity's loss reserves. The loss portfolio transfer entered into during the third quarter of 2019 resulted in total net premiums written and earned of $2.7 million (consisting of $0.9 million of retroactive premium and $1.8 million of prospective (tail) premium) and total net losses and loss adjustment expenses of $2.1 million. The loss portfolio transfer entered into during the second quarter of 2018 resulted in total net premiums written and earned of $26.6 million (consisting of $18.7 million of retroactive premium and $7.9 million of prospective (tail) premium) and total net losses and loss adjustment expenses of $25.4 million. See further discussion of these loss portfolio transfers in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPremiums Written\nChanges in our premium volume within our Specialty P&C segment are driven by four primary factors: (1) the amount of new business, (2) our retention of existing business, (3) the premium charged for business that is renewed, which is affected by rates charged and by the amount and type of coverage an insured chooses to purchase and (4) the timing of premium written through multi-period policies. In addition, premium volume may periodically be affected by shifts in the timing of renewals between periods. The healthcare professional liability market, which accounts for a majority of the revenues in this segment, remains challenging as physicians continue joining hospitals or larger group practices and are thus no longer purchasing individual or group policies in the standard market. In addition, some competitors have chosen to compete primarily on price; both factors may impact our ability to write new business and retain existing business. Furthermore, the insurance and reinsurance markets have historically been cyclical, characterized by extended periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity as well as periods when shortages of capacity permitted more favorable premium levels. Changes in the frequency and severity of losses may affect the cycles of the insurance and reinsurance markets significantly. During soft markets, it could be very difficult for us to grow or maintain premium volume levels without sacrificing underwriting profits. Conversely, during hard markets, rising prices may pressure retention levels.\nGross, ceded and net premiums written were as follows:\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross premiums written\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>577,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>577,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Ceded premiums written\n</td> <td>81,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,098\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums written\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>495,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>494,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross Premiums Written\nGross premiums written by component were as follows:\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional liability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Physicians (1)(8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Twelve month term\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>367,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>352,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Twenty-four month term\n</td> <td>26,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Physicians\n</td> <td>393,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>374,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Healthcare facilities (2)(8)\n</td> <td>63,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,653\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other healthcare providers (3)\n</td> <td>34,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legal professionals (4)\n</td> <td>26,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tail coverages (5)(6)\n</td> <td>21,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,855\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.1\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retroactive coverages (6)\n</td> <td>900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17,808\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(95.2\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total professional liability\n</td> <td>540,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>542,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,740\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medical technology liability (7)\n</td> <td>35,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (9)\n</td> <td>2,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>335.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>577,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>577,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Physician policies were our greatest source of premium revenues in both 2019 and 2018. The increase in twelve month term policies in 2019 included timing differences of $5.6 million primarily related to the prior year renewal of certain policies. Excluding the effect of these timing differences, twelve month term policies increased $9.2 million as compared to 2018. The remaining increase was primarily due to new business written, an increase in exposure related to three policies written on an excess and surplus lines basis totaling $5.2 million and an increase in renewal pricing, partially offset by retention losses. Renewal pricing increases in 2019 are reflective of our concern about increases in loss severity. The lower retention for 2019 is largely attributable to our focus on underwriting discipline, as we continue to emphasize careful risk selection, rate adequacy and a willingness to walk away from business that does not fit our goal of achieving a long-term underwriting profit. We anticipate a lower than average level of retention to persist as we continue to reevaluate certain books of business and set our rates to reflect our observations of higher severity trends. We also offer twenty-four month term policies to our physician insureds in one selected jurisdiction. The increase in twenty-four month term policies in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily reflected the normal cycle of renewals (policies subject to renewal in 2019 were previously written in 2017 rather than in 2018).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Our healthcare facilities premium (which includes hospitals, surgery centers, long-term care facilities and other miscellaneous healthcare facilities) decreased in 2019 as compared to 2018 due to retention losses, partially offset by new business written and, to a lesser extent, an increase in renewal pricing. Retention losses in 2019 were driven by our decision not to renew certain products written on an excess and surplus lines basis after our underwriting evaluation and, to a lesser extent, the loss of two large policies totaling $1.7 million due to price competition as a result of rate increases.

The amount of tail coverage premium written can vary significantly from period to period.

Excluding the impact of the 2018 loss portfolio transfer, the current accident year ceded premiums ratio decreased by approximately 0.4 percentage points in 2019 as compared to 2018 driven by the effect of the non-renewal of the quota share reinsurance agreement with Syndicate 1729 and a decrease in premium ceded under our excess of loss reinsurance arrangements, partially offset by an increase in premium ceded to the SPCs in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment.\nNet Premiums Earned\nNet premiums earned consist of gross premiums earned less the portion of earned premiums that we cede to our reinsurers for their assumption of a portion of our losses. Because premiums are generally earned pro rata over the entire policy period, fluctuations in premiums earned tend to lag those of premiums written. Generally, our policies carry a term of one year; however, as discussed above, we write certain policies with a twenty-four month term, and a few of our medical technology liability policies have a multi-year term. Tail coverage premiums are generally 100% earned in the period written because the policies insure only incidents that occurred in prior periods and are not cancellable. Retroactive coverage premiums are 100% earned at the inception of the contract, as all of the underlying loss events occurred in the past. Additionally, ceded premium changes due to changes to estimates of premiums owed under reinsurance agreements for prior accident years are fully earned in the period of change.\nNet premiums earned were as follows:\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross premiums earned\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>580,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>580,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Ceded premiums earned\n</td> <td>81,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,497\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.4\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums earned\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>499,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>491,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross premiums earned during 2019 and 2018 included the effects of two different loss portfolio transfers which resulted in $2.7 million and $26.6 million, respectively, of one-time premium written and fully earned in the respective periods (see discussion under the heading \"Gross Premiums Written\"). After removing the impacts of the loss portfolio transfers from each period, gross premiums earned increased $24.7 million due to by the pro rata effect of an increase in the volume of written premium during the preceding twelve months, predominantly in our physicians and healthcare facilities lines of business driven by an increase in renewal pricing.\nThe decrease in ceded premiums earned during 2019 as compared to 2018 reflected the effect of adjustments made during 2019 and 2018 to ceded premiums owed under reinsurance agreements related to prior accident year losses. After removing the effect of prior accident year ceded premium adjustments from both years, ceded premiums earned decreased $3.8 million in 2019 as compared to 2018. The remaining decrease was driven by the non-renewal of the quota share reinsurance agreement with Syndicate 1729, partially offset by the pro rata effect of an increase in premiums ceded under our shared risk arrangements during the preceding twelve months, predominantly in our CAPAssurance program.\nLosses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nThe determination of calendar year losses involves the actuarial evaluation of incurred losses for the current accident year and the actuarial re-evaluation of incurred losses for prior accident years, including an evaluation of the reserve amounts required for losses in excess of policy limits.\nAccident year refers to the accounting period in which the insured event becomes a liability of the insurer. For claims-made policies, which represent the majority of the premiums written in our Specialty P&C segment, the insured event generally becomes a liability when the event is first reported to us. For occurrence policies, the insured event becomes a liability when the event takes place. For retroactive coverages, the insured event becomes a liability at inception of the underlying contract. We believe that measuring losses on an accident year basis is the best measure of the underlying profitability of the premiums earned in that period, since it associates policy premiums earned with the estimate of the losses incurred related to those policy premiums.\nThe following table summarizes calendar year net loss ratios by separating losses between the current accident year and all prior accident years. Additionally, the table shows our current accident year net loss ratios were affected by revisions to our estimate of premiums owed to reinsurers related to coverages provided in prior accident years. The net loss ratios for our Specialty P&C segment were as follows:\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Net Loss Ratios (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Calendar year net loss ratio\n</td> <td>106.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less impact of prior accident years on the net loss ratio\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.6\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current accident year net loss ratio\n</td> <td>105.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less estimated ratio increase (decrease) attributable to:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ceded premium adjustments, prior accident years (2)\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current accident year net loss ratio, excluding the effect of prior year ceded premium (3)\n</td> <td>104.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Net losses, as specified, divided by net premiums earned.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>During 2019 and 2018, we increased the premiums owed under reinsurance agreements for prior accident years which decreased net premiums earned (the denominator of the current accident year ratio).

Both our internal and consulting actuaries perform an in-depth review of our current accident year reserve on at least a semi-annual basis. As a result of these analyses in both 2019 and 2018, we increased our current accident year net loss ratio; however, the adjustment was greater in 2019 as compared to 2018 which accounted for 6.0 percentage points of the increase in the current accident year net loss ratio. This increase in 2019 was driven by increased reserve estimates for a large national healthcare account and, to a lesser extent, in our broader HCPL excess and surplus lines of business.\nOur broader HCPL excess and surplus lines of business include custom physicians, healthcare facilities, correctional healthcare and long-term care policies. Also as a result of our annual actuarial analysis, we increased our reserves related to DDR coverage endorsements in 2019 as compared to a decrease in 2018 which accounted for 2.9 percentage points of the increase in the current accident year net loss ratio. Furthermore, as part of our quarterly evaluation of the recoverability of DPAC, we recognized a PDR of $9.2 million which accounted for 1.9 percentage points of the increase in the current accident year net loss ratio. The PDR represents an estimated premium deficiency associated with the unearned premium of the aforementioned large national healthcare account which is reflected as a component of our current accident year net losses; no such reserves were established in 2018. The remaining increase in our current accident year net loss ratio of 1.3 percentage points was primarily due to changes in the mix of business. Current accident year loss ratios for our core physicians, podiatric, chiropractic, legal professional liability and medical technology liability businesses were relatively unchanged as compared to 2018.\nAs a result of our re-evaluation of previously established reserves, we recognized net unfavorable prior year reserve development of $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to net favorable prior year reserve development of $77.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Development recognized during 2019 principally related to accident years 2016 through 2018. Development recognized during 2018 principally related to accident years 2011 through 2014. Net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2019 included $51.5 million of unfavorable prior year reserve development related to our reserves for the previously mentioned large national healthcare account that has experienced losses far exceeding the assumptions we made when underwriting the account, beginning in 2016. Excluding the unfavorable development related to this account, the Specialty P&C segment recognized favorable prior year reserve development totaling $45.8 million in 2019 which included favorable loss development in our medical technology liability line of business of $12.8 million. Net favorable loss development in 2018 of $77.0 million included $13.3 million and $10.9 million attributable to our medical technology liability and legal professional liability lines of business, respectively. While the majority of our reserves continue to develop favorably, the favorable development we recognized, excluding the large national healthcare account, was lower as compared to 2018 due to the observed increase in claim severity in the broader HCPL industry.\nA detailed discussion of factors influencing our recognition of loss development is included in our Critical Accounting Estimates section under the heading \"Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses.\" Assumptions used in establishing our reserve are regularly reviewed and updated by management as new data becomes available. Any adjustments necessary are reflected in the then current operations. Due to the size of our reserve, even a small percentage adjustment to the assumptions can have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the change is made, as was the case in both 2019 and 2018.\nUnderwriting, Policy Acquisition and Operating Expenses\nOur Specialty P&C segment underwriting, policy acquisition and operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were comprised as follows:\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DPAC amortization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management fees\n</td> <td>6,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(226\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.2\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other underwriting and operating expenses\n</td> <td>56,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>112,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDPAC amortization increased during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 driven by an increase in earned premium, excluding the effects of the premium earned from the loss portfolio transfers in 2019 and 2018 as there were no deferred acquisition costs associated with those transactions (see discussion under the heading \"Gross Premiums Written\"). In addition, the increase in DPAC amortization also reflected a decrease in ceding commission income related to the reduction in premiums ceded to Syndicate 1729, partially offset by an increase in ceding commission income from certain of our shared risk arrangements.\nManagement fees are charged pursuant to a management agreement by the Corporate segment to the operating subsidiaries within our Specialty P&C segment for services provided based on the extent to which services are provided to the subsidiary and the amount of premium written by the subsidiary. While the terms of the management agreement were consistent between 2019 and 2018, fluctuations in the amount of premium written by each subsidiary can result in corresponding variations in the management fee charged to each subsidiary during a particular period.\nOther underwriting and operating expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily driven by $4.9 million of fees incurred in 2019 as compared to $1.0 million in 2018 associated with a data analytics services agreement entered into during the fourth quarter of 2018, partially offset by a decrease in compensation related costs primarily due to lower bonuses. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the data analytics services agreement.\nUnderwriting Expense Ratio (the Expense Ratio)\nOur expense ratio for the Specialty P&C segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 was as follows:\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting expense ratio\n</td> <td>24.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nExcluding the impacts of the loss portfolio transfers entered into during 2019 and 2018 (net premiums earned with minimal associated operating expenses), our underwriting expense ratio was relatively unchanged for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 as the increase in earned premium and the decrease in compensation related costs outpaced the increase in DPAC amortization and offset the effect of the fees incurred related to the data analytics services agreement, as previously discussed.\nSegment Operating Results - Workers' Compensation Insurance\nOur Workers' Compensation Insurance segment includes workers' compensation products provided to employers generally with 1,000 or fewer employees, as discussed in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Workers' compensation products offered include guaranteed cost policies, policyholder dividend policies, retrospectively-rated policies, deductible policies and alternative market solutions. Alternative market products include program design, fronting, claims administration, risk management, SPC rental, asset management and SPC management services. Alternative market program premiums are 100% ceded to either the SPCs within our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment or, to a limited extent, an unaffiliated captive insurer. Our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment operating results reflected pre-tax underwriting profit or loss from these workers' compensation products, exclusive of investment results, which are included in our Corporate segment.

compared to 2018, which reflected our response to underpricing that is occurring in a very competitive market. New business written, renewal pricing and the retention rate all declined during 2019. The decrease in deductible premiums written primarily reflects\nthe loss of three accounts. The decrease in retrospective policy premiums written primarily reflects the loss of two accounts and the impact of retrospective premium adjustments which are based on the loss experience of the underlying policies. Retrospective premium adjustments in 2019 decreased premiums written by $2.1 million as compared to adjustments in 2018 that increased premiums written by $0.8 million. Other premiums written primarily reflect our participation in residual market pools in the states in which we operate; premiums are based on information provided to us by the residual market.\nNew business opportunities, renewal pricing and retention continue to be a challenge as a result of intense competition, especially from multi-line carriers that are willing to underprice their workers' compensation products to offset other coverages. This has resulted in fewer new business opportunities, which is reflected in a 20% decline in submissions during 2019. The decrease in new business in 2019 as compared to 2018 also reflects the acquisition of the Great Falls renewal book of business in September 2017, which contributed $11.7 million of new business for the year ended December 31, 2018. Excluding the Great Falls acquisition, submissions declined 12% during 2019. Renewal pricing decreases reflect the competitive market, as well as the impact of state loss cost decreases in the majority of the states in which we write business.\nGross premiums written in our alternative market business decreased for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. New business and renewal pricing trends in our alternative market business for 2019 were relatively consistent with the trends in our traditional business. We retained all 22 of the available workers' compensation alternative market programs up for renewal for the year ended December 31, 2019, including 6 programs available for renewal during the fourth quarter of 2019. Additionally, we wrote one new workers' compensation alternative market program in the third quarter of 2019.\nNew business, audit premium, retention and renewal price changes for both the traditional business and the alternative market business are shown in the table below:\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>Traditional Business\n</td> <td>Alternative Market Business\n</td> <td>Segment\nResults\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Traditional Business\n</td> <td>Alternative Market Business\n</td> <td>Segment\nResults\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New business\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Audit premium (including EBUB)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retention (1)\n</td> <td>79\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>83\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in renewal pricing (2)\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) We calculate our workers' compensation retention as annualized expiring renewed premium divided by all annualized expiring premium subject to renewal.

Effective May 1, 2019, our primary reinsurance layer was renewed with an AAD equal to the greater of $3.9 million or 2.1% of subject premium, in excess of the $0.5 million retention per loss occurrence, and the elimination of the return premium component of the contract. The addition of the AAD was partially offset by a reduction in the reinsurance rates under our renewed treaty. Per our reinsurance agreements, we cede premiums related to our traditional business on an earned premium basis. The increase in premiums ceded to external\nreinsurers during the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily reflected an increase in earned premium, partially offset by the impact of lower reinsurance rates for the treaty year effective May 1, 2019.\nThe decrease in premiums ceded to unaffiliated captive insurers during the year ended December 31, 2019 reflected the impact of a novation of an unaffiliated captive program into an SPC at Inova Re during the fourth quarter of 2018. The premium ceded to this program is now reflected in premiums ceded to SPCs in the table above. For the year ended December 31, 2018, premiums related to this program that were ceded to the unaffiliated captive totaled $1.8 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, premiums ceded to unaffiliated captive insurers in the table above reflected business ceded to one unaffiliated captive program.\nChanges in the return premium estimate reflected the loss experience under the reinsurance treaties during 2019 and 2018.

Because premiums are generally earned pro rata over the entire policy period, fluctuations in premiums earned tend to lag those of premiums written. Our workers' compensation policies are twelve month term policies, and premiums are earned on a pro rata basis over the policy period. Net premiums earned also include premium adjustments related to the audit of our insureds' payrolls. Payroll audits are conducted subsequent to the end of the policy period and any related adjustments are recorded as fully earned in the current period. In addition, we record an estimate for EBUB and evaluate the estimate on a quarterly basis. We did not adjust the EBUB estimate during the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018. The increase in net premiums earned primarily reflected the pro rata effect of higher net premiums written during the preceding twelve months, partially offset by the retrospective policy premium adjustments, as previously discussed.\nLosses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nWe estimate our current accident year loss and loss adjustment expenses based on an expected loss ratio. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses for the current accident year are determined by applying the expected loss ratio to net premiums earned, which includes audit premium, for the respective period. The following table summarizes calendar year net loss ratios by separating losses between the current accident year and all prior accident years. Calendar year and current accident year net loss ratios by component were as follows:\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Calendar year net loss ratio\n</td> <td>64.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less impact of prior accident years on the net loss ratio\n</td> <td>(4.1\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.3\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current accident year net loss ratio\n</td> <td>68.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 2019 current accident year net loss ratio reflects the impact of the AAD (see previous discussion under the heading \"Ceded Premiums Written\") and renewal rate decreases, largely offset by overall favorable trends in claim closing patterns during 2019.\nCalendar year incurred losses (excluding IBNR) ceded to our external reinsurers decreased $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. Current accident year ceded incurred losses decreased $5.5 million as compared to 2018. The decrease in losses ceded to our external reinsurers primarily reflects the impact of the AAD, which reduced ceded losses by $3.9 million, and a reduction in reported reinsured claims during 2019.\nWe recognized net favorable development related to our previously established reserves of $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $8.0 million for 2018. The net favorable prior year development for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 reflected overall favorable trends in claim closing patterns, primarily in the 2015 and 2016 accident years. For each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the net favorable prior year development included $1.6 million related to the amortization of the purchase accounting fair value adjustment. The fair value adjustment has been fully amortized as of December 31, 2019.\nUnderwriting, Policy Acquisition and Operating Expenses\nUnderwriting, policy acquisition and operating expenses includes the amortization of commissions, premium taxes and underwriting salaries, which are capitalized and deferred over the related workers' compensation policy period, net of ceding commissions earned. The capitalization of underwriting salaries can vary as they are subject to the success rate of our contract acquisition efforts. These expenses also include a management fee charged by our Corporate segment, which represents intercompany charges pursuant to a management agreement, and the amortization of intangible assets, primarily related to the acquisition of Eastern by ProAssurance. The management fee is based on the extent to which services are provided to the subsidiary and the amount of premium written by the subsidiary.\nOur Workers' Compensation Insurance segment underwriting, policy acquisition and operating expenses were comprised as follows:\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DPAC amortization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management fees\n</td> <td>2,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(105\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.8\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other underwriting and operating expenses\n</td> <td>39,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SPC ceding commission offset\n</td> <td>(17,979\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17,259\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(720\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in DPAC amortization for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily reflected the increase in net premiums earned. The increase in other underwriting and operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 reflected an increase in compensation and benefit related costs, technology costs, including an increase in the allocation of technology costs charged by our Corporate segment, professional fees and bad debt expense.\nAs previously discussed, alternative market premiums written through our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment's alternative market business unit are 100% ceded, less a ceding commission, to either the SPCs in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment or, to a limited extent, an unaffiliated captive insurer. The ceding commission consists of an amount for fronting fees, cell rental fees, commissions, premium taxes and risk management fees. The fronting fees, commissions, premium taxes and risk management fees are recorded as an offset to underwriting, policy acquisition and operating expenses. Cell rental fees are recorded as a component of other income and claims administration fees are recorded as ceded ULAE. The increase in SPC ceding commissions earned in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily reflected the increase in alternative market earned premium.\nUnderwriting Expense Ratio (the Expense Ratio)\nThe underwriting expense ratio included the impact of the following:\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting expense ratio, as reported\n</td> <td>30.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less estimated ratio increase (decrease) attributable to:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of ceding commissions received from SPCs\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retrospective premium adjustment\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of audit premium\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting expense ratio, less listed effects\n</td> <td>27.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in the expense ratio for the year ended December 31, 2019, exclusive of the items noted in the table, primarily reflected the increase in other underwriting and operating expenses noted above.\nSegment Operating Results - Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance\nThe Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment reflects the operating results (underwriting profit or loss, plus investment results, net of U.S. federal income taxes) of SPCs at Inova Re and Eastern Re, our Cayman Islands SPC operations, as discussed in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. SPCs are segregated pools of assets and liabilities that provide an insurance facility for a defined set of risks. Assets of each SPC are solely for the benefit of that individual cell and each SPC is solely responsible for the liabilities of that individual cell. Assets of one SPC are statutorily protected from the creditors of the others. Each SPC is owned, fully or in part, by an agency, group or association and the operating results of the SPCs are attributable to the participants of that cell. We participate to a varying degree in the results of selected SPCs and, for the SPCs in which we participate, our participation interest ranges from a low of 20% to a high of 85%. SPC operating results attributable to external cell participants are reflected as an SPC dividend expense in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment. In addition, our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment includes the SPC investment results as the investments are solely for the benefit of the cell participants, and investment results attributable to external cell participants are reflected in the SPC dividend expense. As of December 31, 2019, there were 27 (23 active) SPCs. The SPCs assume workers' compensation insurance, healthcare professional liability insurance or a combination of the two from our Workers' Compensation Insurance and Specialty P&C segments. As of December 31, 2019, there were two SPCs that assumed both workers' compensation insurance and healthcare professional liability insurance and one SPC that assumed only healthcare professional liability insurance. In addition, an SPC at Eastern Re assumed an errors and omissions liability policy from a captive insurer unaffiliated with ProAssurance during 2019.\nSegment operating results reflects our share of the underwriting and investment results of the SPCs in which we participate, and included the following:\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums written\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums earned\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>1,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized gains (losses)\n</td> <td>4,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,149\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>7,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(227.7\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net losses and loss adjustment expenses\n</td> <td>(52,412\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(38,726\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(13,686\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>35.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting, policy acquisition and operating expenses(1)\n</td> <td>(24,260\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(22,426\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1,834\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SPC net operating results\n</td> <td>8,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,368\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(29.5\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SPC dividend (expense) income(2)\n</td> <td>(4,579\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(9,122\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>4,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(49.8\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating results(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss ratio\n</td> <td>66.7%\n</td> <td>52.4%\n</td> <td>14.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting expense ratio(1)\n</td> <td>30.9%\n</td> <td>30.3%\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Underwriting, policy acquisition and operating expenses in both 2019 and 2018 included a provision for U.S. federal income taxes of $1.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively, for SPCs at Inova Re that have elected to be taxed as U.S. taxpayers. The portion of U.S. federal income taxes attributable to external cell participants is reflected in SPC dividend (expense) income. See the section that follows under the heading \"Underwriting, Policy Acquisition and Operating Expenses\" for the impact the provision for U.S. federal income taxes had on the underwriting expense ratio in 2019 and 2018 as these U.S. federal income taxes do not represent underwriting expenses of the SPCs.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2) Represents the net operating (profit) loss attributable to external cell participants.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3) Represents our share of the net operating profit (loss) of the SPCs in which we participate.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPremiums Written\nThe majority of premiums in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment are assumed from either our Workers' Compensation Insurance or Specialty P&C segments. Premium volume is driven by five primary factors: (1) the amount of new business written, (2) retention of the existing book of business, (3) premium rates charged on the renewal book of business and, for workers' compensation business, (4) changes in payroll exposure and (5) audit premium.\nGross, ceded and net premiums written were as follows:\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross premiums written\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Ceded premiums written\n</td> <td>9,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(38\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums written\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross Premiums Written\nGross premiums written reflected reinsurance premiums assumed by component as follows:\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Workers' compensation\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(128\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Healthcare professional liability\n</td> <td>6,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>nm\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross Premiums Written\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross premiums written for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were primarily comprised of workers' compensation coverages assumed from our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment. Workers' compensation gross premiums written decreased during 2019, primarily reflecting the competitive workers' compensation market. The increase in healthcare professional liability gross premiums written during 2019 was driven primarily by the addition of one large policy and the renewal of certain policies in 2019 that were written on a short-term basis in 2018. We retained 100% of the available alternative market programs up for renewal during 2019, including 22 workers' compensation programs and 3 healthcare professional liability programs. Additionally, we added one new alternative market program at Inova Re during the third quarter of 2019.\nNew business, audit premium, retention and renewal price changes for the assumed workers' compensation premium is shown in the table below:\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Audit premium (including EBUB)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retention rate (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in renewal pricing (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) We calculate our workers' compensation retention rate as annualized expiring renewed premium divided by all annualized expiring premium subject to renewal.

The healthcare professional liability business is assumed net of reinsurance from our Specialty P&C segment; therefore, there are no ceded premiums related to the healthcare professional liability business reflected in the table above. The risk retention for each loss occurrence for the workers' compensation business ranges from $0.3 million to $0.35 million based on the program, with limits up to $119.7 million. In addition, each program has aggregate reinsurance coverage between $1.1 million and $2.1 million on a program year basis. Per the SPC external reinsurance agreements, premiums are ceded on a written premium basis and changes in ceded premiums written during 2019 primarily reflected changes in gross premiums written as compared to 2018. External reinsurance rates vary based on the alternative market program.\nCeded Premiums Ratio\nCeded premiums ratio was as follows:\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ceded premiums ratio\n</td> <td>11.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe above table reflects ceded premiums as a percent of gross premiums written for the workers' compensation business only; healthcare professional liability business is assumed net of reinsurance, as discussed above. The ceded premiums ratio reflects the weighted average reinsurance rates of all SPC programs. The ceded premiums ratio remained unchanged for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018.\nNet Premiums Earned\nGross, ceded and net premiums earned were as follows:\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross premiums earned\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Ceded premiums earned\n</td> <td>9,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums earned\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet premiums earned consist of gross premiums earned less the portion of earned premiums that the SPCs cede to external reinsurers. Because premiums are generally earned pro rata over the entire policy period, fluctuations in premiums earned tend to lag those of premiums written. Policies ceded to the SPCs are twelve month term policies and premiums are earned on a pro rata basis over the policy period. Net premiums earned also include premium adjustments related to the audit of workers' compensation insureds' payrolls. Payroll audits are conducted subsequent to the end of the policy period and any related adjustments are recorded as fully earned in the current period. The increase in net premiums earned primarily reflected the pro rata effect of higher net premiums written during the preceding twelve months.\nNet Investment Income and Net Realized Investment Gains (Losses)\nNet investment income for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was primarily attributable to interest earned on available-for-sale fixed maturity investments, which primarily includes investment-grade corporate debt securities. Net realized investment gains for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily reflected realized gains from the sale of equity securities. Net realized investment losses for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily reflected a decrease in the fair value of the equity securities portfolio.\nLosses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nThe following table summarizes the calendar year net loss ratios by separating losses between the current accident year and all prior accident years. The current accident year net loss ratio reflected the aggregate loss ratio for all programs. Loss reserves are estimated for each program on a quarterly basis. Due to the size of some of the programs, quarterly loss results can create volatility in the current accident year net loss ratio to fluctuate significantly from period to period.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment's net loss ratio was affected by a $10 million reserve that an SPC at Eastern Re established during the second quarter of 2019. This SPC previously assumed an errors and omissions policy that provides coverage for losses up to a lifetime maximum of $10 million from a captive insurer unaffiliated with ProAssurance. During the second quarter of 2019, a claim was filed under this policy that met the lifetime maximum limit and, accordingly, a $10 million reserve was recorded. We do not participate in the SPC that assumed this policy; therefore, these losses are the obligation of the external cell participants and are reflected as an offset in the SPC dividend expense (income) and have no effect on our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment net operating results for the year ended December 31, 2019. Given the significance of this one-time event, we have removed the impact of the policy from each of the ratios below (as shown in the columns labeled \"Adjusted\") in order to assist in the comparability between periods. Calendar year and current accident year net loss ratios for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>E&O reserve impact\n</td> <td>Adjusted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As reported\n</td> <td>Adjusted\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Calendar year net loss ratio\n</td> <td>66.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.3\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> <td>54.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less impact of prior accident years on the net loss ratio\n</td> <td>(12.9\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> <td>(12.9\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.1\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current accident year net loss ratio\n</td> <td>79.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.3\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> <td>67.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nExcluding the impact of the errors and omissions liability policy, as shown above, the current accident year net loss ratio increased in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to an increase in severity-related claims activity.\nCalendar year incurred losses ceded to our external reinsurers increased $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. Current accident year ceded incurred losses increased $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. The increase in current accident year ceded incurred losses primarily reflected the impact of four claims totaling $11.2 million, of which $8.3 million related to two claims, incurred in 2019.\nWe recognized net favorable prior year development of $10.1 million and $9.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The net favorable prior year reserve development for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily reflected overall favorable trends in claim closing patterns, primarily in the 2015 through 2018 accident years. The net favorable prior year reserve development for the year ended December 31, 2018 also primarily reflected overall favorable trends in claim closing patterns, primarily in the 2015 through 2017 accident years.\nUnderwriting, Policy Acquisition and Operating Expenses\nOur Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment underwriting, policy acquisition and operating expenses were comprised as follows:\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DPAC amortization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other underwriting and operating expenses\n</td> <td>2,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDPAC amortization primarily represented ceding commissions, which vary by program and are paid to our Workers' Compensation Insurance and Specialty P&C segments for premiums assumed. Ceding commissions include an amount for fronting fees, commissions, premium taxes and risk management fees, which are reported as an offset to underwriting, policy acquisition and operating expenses within our Workers' Compensation Insurance and Specialty P&C segments. In addition, ceding commissions paid to our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment include cell rental fees which are recorded as other income within our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment.\nOther underwriting and operating expenses primarily include bank fees, professional fees, bad debt expense and a provision for federal income taxes paid by the SPCs. The increase in other underwriting and operating expense for the year\nended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily reflected an increase in the provision for federal income taxes and fees related to letters of credit posted as program collateral. The provision for federal income taxes totaled $1.1 million and $0.4 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nUnderwriting Expense Ratio (the Expense Ratio)\nThe underwriting expense ratio included the impact of the following:\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting expense ratio, as reported\n</td> <td>30.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of audit premium\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of provision for federal income taxes related to SPCs at Inova Re\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting expense ratio, less listed effects\n</td> <td>30.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnderwriting, policy acquisition and operating expenses in both 2019 and 2018 included a provision for U.S. federal income taxes of $1.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively, for SPCs at Inova Re that have elected to be taxed as U.S. tax payers. The increase in the federal income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 reflects an increase in taxable income for the Inova Re SPCs. This provision for federal income taxes is included in the total SPC net operating results and the portion of federal income taxes attributable to external cell participants is reflected in the SPC dividend (expense) income. We have removed the impact of the provision for U.S. federal income taxes from the expense ratio as these expenses do not represent underwriting expenses of the SPCs.\nExcluding the effects of audit premium and the provision for U.S. federal income taxes, the underwriting expense ratio primarily reflected the weighted average ceding commission percentage of all SPC programs.\nSegment Operating Results - Lloyd's Syndicates\nOur Lloyd's Syndicates segment includes operating results from our participation in certain Syndicates at Lloyd's of London. In addition to our participation in Syndicate operating results, we have investments in and other obligations to our Lloyd's Syndicates consisting of a Syndicate Credit Agreement and FAL requirements. For the 2019 underwriting year, our FAL was comprised of investment securities and cash and cash equivalents deposited with Lloyd's which at December 31, 2019 had a fair value of approximately $137.1 million, as discussed in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe normally report results from our involvement in Lloyd's Syndicates on a quarter lag, except when information is available that is material to the current period (see discussion that follows under the heading \"Property and Natural Catastrophe Losses\"). Furthermore, the investment results associated with our FAL investments and certain U.S. paid administrative expenses are reported concurrently as that information is available on an earlier time frame.\nLloyd's Syndicate 1729. We provide capital to Syndicate 1729, which covers a range of property and casualty insurance and reinsurance lines in both the U.S. and international markets. The remaining capital for Syndicate 1729 is provided by unrelated third parties, including private names and other corporate members. For the 2019 underwriting year, we slightly decreased our participation in the operating results of Syndicate 1729 from 62% to 61% which, due to the quarter lag, was not reflected in our Lloyd's Syndicates segment results until the second quarter of 2019. Syndicate 1729 had a maximum underwriting capacity of \u00a3128 million (approximately $169.7 million at December 31, 2019) for the 2019 underwriting year, of which \u00a378 million ($103 million based on December 31, 2019 exchange rates) was our allocated underwriting capacity. To reduce our exposure and the associated earnings volatility, we decreased our participation in the operating results of Syndicate 1729 for the 2020 underwriting year from 61% to 29% which, due to the quarter lag, will not be reflected in our Lloyd's Syndicates segment results until the second quarter of 2020. Syndicate 1729's maximum underwriting capacity for the 2020 underwriting year is \u00a3135 million (approximately $179 million at December 31, 2019), of which \u00a339 million (approximately $51 million at December 31, 2019) is our allocated underwriting capacity.\nLloyd's Syndicate 6131. We are the sole (100%) capital provider to an SPA, Syndicate 6131, which focuses on contingency and specialty property business in both the U.S. and international markets. As an SPA, Syndicate 6131 is only allowed to underwrite one quota share reinsurance contract with Syndicate 1729. Due to the quarter lag, our participation in Syndicate 6131 was not reflected in our Lloyd's Syndicates segment results until the second quarter of 2018, as Syndicate 6131 began writing business effective January 1, 2018. For the 2019 underwriting year Syndicate 6131 had a maximum underwriting capacity of \u00a312 million ($16 million based on December 31, 2019 exchange rates). For the 2020 underwriting year, Syndicate 6131 has a maximum underwriting capacity of \u00a312 million (approximately $16 million at December 31, 2019).\nIn addition to the results of our participation in Lloyd's Syndicates, as discussed above, our Lloyd's Syndicates segment also includes 100% of the operating results of our wholly owned subsidiaries that support our operations at Lloyd's. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the results of our Lloyd's Syndicates segment were as follows:\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross premiums written\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ceded premiums written\n</td> <td>(23,802\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(18,877\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(4,925\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>26.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums written\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums earned\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>4,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized gains (losses)\n</td> <td>768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(460\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>1,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>267.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (loss)\n</td> <td>(573\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(895\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(278.0\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net losses and loss adjustment expenses\n</td> <td>(47,369\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(51,570\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>4,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.1\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting, policy acquisition and operating expenses\n</td> <td>(34,711\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(31,686\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(3,025\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit (expense)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(317\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(100.0\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating results\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12,672\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>126.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss ratio\n</td> <td>58.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>76.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(18.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting expense ratio\n</td> <td>43.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>47.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(4.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProperty and Natural Catastrophe Losses\nAs previously mentioned, we normally report results from our involvement in Lloyd's Syndicates on a quarter lag; however, during the fourth quarter of 2018, we accelerated our reporting of approximately $6.8 million, net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums, of storm-related losses in connection with Hurricane Michael, which affected the northwest portion of Florida during October 2018. These losses would have normally been reported in the first quarter of 2019 due to the aforementioned quarter delay. However, due to the availability and significance of these estimates, we accelerated our reporting of these storm-related losses into the fourth quarter of 2018, which is consistent with our policy of disclosing significant losses in the period in which they become known to us. No such adjustments were made during 2019.\nGross Premiums Written\nChanges in our premium volume within our Lloyd's Syndicates segment are driven by four primary factors: (1) the amount of new business and the channels in which the business is written, (2) our retention of existing business, (3) the premium charged for business that is renewed, which is affected by rates charged and by the amount and type of coverage an insured chooses to purchase and (4) the timing of premium written through multi-period policies.\nGross premiums written in 2019 consisted of property insurance coverages (42% of total gross premiums written), casualty coverages (31%), catastrophe reinsurance coverages (16%), specialty property coverages (8%) and property reinsurance coverages (3%). The increase in gross premiums written during 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily driven by volume increases on renewal business and renewal pricing increases, as well as new business written, primarily property insurance coverages.\nAs discussed in our Specialty P&C segment operating results, prior to January 1, 2018 Syndicate 1729 served as a reinsurer on a quota share basis for a wholly owned insurance subsidiary in our Specialty P&C segment. Premiums assumed from our Specialty P&C segment were approximately $1.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The 2017 and 2016 calendar year quota share arrangements with our Specialty P&C segment were commuted in December 2018 and 2017, respectively. Due to the quarter lag, the effects of the 2017 and 2016 commutations were reported in both segments' results during the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively, and are reflected in the Lloyd's Syndicates segment results for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The commutations did not differ significantly from the previously recorded amounts.\nCeded Premiums Written\nSyndicate 1729 utilizes reinsurance to provide the capacity to write larger limits of liability on individual risks, to provide protection against catastrophic loss and to provide protection against losses in excess of policy limits. Ceded premiums written increased for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to the overall increase in gross premiums written.\nNet Premiums Earned\nNet premiums earned consist of gross premiums earned less the portion of earned premiums that we cede to our reinsurers for their assumption of a portion of our losses. Premiums written through open-market channels are generally earned pro rata over the entire policy period, which is predominately twelve months, whereas premiums written through delegated underwriting authority arrangements are earned over twenty-four months. Therefore, net premiums earned is affected by shifts in the mix of policies written between the open-market and delegated underwriting authority arrangements. Additionally, fluctuations in premiums earned tend to lag those of premiums written. Premiums for certain policies and assumed reinsurance contracts are reported subsequent to the coverage period and/or may be subject to adjustment based on loss experience. These premium adjustments are earned when reported, which can result in further fluctuation in earned premium.\nGross, ceded and net premiums earned were as follows:\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross premiums earned\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Ceded premiums earned\n</td> <td>20,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums earned\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in gross premiums earned for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 was driven by the pro rata effect of higher premiums written during the preceding twelve months, primarily property insurance coverages and, to a greater extent for 2019, the pro rata effect of shifts in the mix of premiums written during the preceding twelve months; a larger proportion of premiums were written through the open-market, as compared to previous years, which are predominately earned\nover twelve months. During 2019, the increase in gross premiums earned also reflected our participation in Syndicate 6131 at the beginning of 2018, which was not reflected in our Lloyd's Syndicates Segment results until the second quarter of 2018.\nThe increase in ceded premiums earned during 2019 was driven by the pro rata effect of an increase in premiums ceded under reinsurance arrangements during the preceding twelve months due to the increase in gross premiums earned, as previously discussed.\nGross and net premiums earned included a nominal amount of premium assumed from our Specialty P&C segment during 2019 as compared to approximately $5.0 million of premium assumed during 2018.\nNet Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nLosses for the year were primarily recorded using the loss assumptions by risk category incorporated into the business plans submitted to Lloyd's for Syndicate 1729 and Syndicate 6131 with consideration given to loss experience incurred to date. The assumptions used in each business plan were consistent with loss results reflected in Lloyd's historical data for similar risks. The loss ratios may fluctuate due to the timing of earned premium adjustments (see discussion in this section under the heading \"Net Premiums Earned\"). Premium and exposure for some of Syndicate 1729's insurance policies and reinsurance contracts are initially estimated and subsequently adjusted over an extended period of time as underlying premium reports are received from cedants and insureds. When reports are received, the premium, exposure and corresponding loss estimates are revised accordingly. Changes in loss estimates due to premium or exposure fluctuations are incurred in the accident year in which the premium is earned.\nThe following table summarizes calendar year net loss ratios by separating losses between the current accident year and all prior accident years. Net loss ratios for the period were as follows:\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Calendar year net loss ratio\n</td> <td>58.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less impact of prior accident years on the net loss ratio\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current accident year net loss ratio\n</td> <td>58.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in the current accident year net loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was driven by an increase in estimated reinsurance recoveries related to property and catastrophe related losses as well as the increase in net premiums earned, as previously discussed.\nWe recognized $0.4 million of unfavorable prior year development for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $2.0 million of unfavorable prior year development for the year ended December 31, 2018. The unfavorable prior year development for the year ended December 31, 2018 was driven by higher than expected losses and development on certain large claims which resulted in unfavorable development with respect to a previous year of account.\nUnderwriting, Policy Acquisition and Operating Expenses\nUnderwriting, policy acquisition and operating expenses increased by $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to an increase in DPAC amortization driven by an increase in net premiums earned, partially offset by the effect of higher operational expenses incurred associated with establishing Syndicate 6131 during 2018.\nThe decrease in the underwriting expense ratio for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to the increased volume of earned premium as a result of the growth of the Syndicates. In addition, the decrease in the underwriting expense ratio reflected the effect of higher operational expenses in 2018 associated with the establishment of Syndicate 6131.\nInvestments\nNet investment income increased during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 due to an increase in interest earned on our FAL due to a higher average FAL balance in 2019 as compared to 2018. Our FAL primarily includes investment-grade corporate debt securities. Syndicate 1729's fixed maturities portfolio includes certain debt securities classified as trading securities. Investment results associated with these fixed maturity trading securities are reported on the same quarter lag.\nTaxes\nOperating results of this segment are subject to U.K. income tax law.\nSegment Operating Results - Corporate\nOur Corporate segment includes our investment operations, other than those reported in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance and Lloyd's Syndicates segments, interest expense and U.S. income taxes, as discussed in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our Corporate segment also includes non-premium revenues generated outside of our insurance entities and corporate expenses.

In addition, on an overall basis, our average investment in fixed maturity securities was approximately 2% higher for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018.\nAverage yields for our fixed maturity portfolio were as follows:\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average income yield\n</td> <td>3.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average tax equivalent income yield\n</td> <td>3.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEquities\nIncome from our equity portfolio decreased during 2019 as compared to 2018 which reflected a decrease in our allocation to this asset category as well as a different mix of equities owned.\nShort-term Investments and Other Investments\nShort-term investments, which have a maturity at purchase of one year or less, are carried at fair value, which approximates their cost basis, and are primarily composed of investments in U.S. treasury obligations, commercial paper and money market funds. Income from our short-term and other investments increased during 2019 primarily attributable to higher yields as compared to 2018.\nEquity in Earnings (Loss) of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries\nEquity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated subsidiaries was as follows:\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other investments, primarily investment fund LPs/LLCs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(22,428\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(67.4\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax credit partnerships\n</td> <td>(20,903\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24,322\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.1\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated subsidiaries\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,061\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(19,009\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(212.4\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe hold interests in certain LPs/LLCs that generate earnings from trading portfolios, secured debt, debt securities, multi-strategy funds and private equity investments. The performance of the LPs/LLCs is affected by the volatility of equity and credit markets. For our investments in LPs/LLCs, we record our allocable portion of the partnership operating income or loss as\nthe results of the LPs/LLCs become available. Our investment results from our portfolio of investments in LPs/LLCs decreased for the year ended December 31, 2019 driven by lower reported earnings from two LP investments which accounted for $20.5 million of the decrease as compared to 2018.\nOur tax credit partnership investments are designed to generate returns in the form of tax credits and tax-deductible project operating losses and are comprised of qualified affordable housing project tax credit partnerships and historic tax credit partnerships. We account for our tax credit partnership investments under the equity method and record our allocable portion of the operating losses of the underlying properties based on estimates provided by the partnerships. For our qualified affordable housing project tax credit partnerships, we adjust our estimates of our allocable portion of operating losses periodically as actual operating results of the underlying properties become available. Our historic tax credit partnerships are short-term in nature and the majority of the remaining operating losses are expected to be recognized in 2020. The results from our tax credit partnership investments for the year ended December 31, 2019 reflected lower partnership operating losses as compared to 2018. Based on operating results received, we increased our estimate of partnership operating losses by $3.0 million in each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nThe tax benefits received from our tax credit partnerships, which are not reflected in our investment results above, reduced our tax expenses in 2019 and 2018 as follows:\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax credits recognized during the period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax benefit of tax credit partnership operating losses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDue to our consolidated loss before income taxes recognized for the year ended December 31, 2019, the tax credits generated in 2019 from our tax credit partnership investments of $18.1 million were deferred and are expected to be utilized in future periods. Tax credits in the above table recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019 included tax credits of $3.8 million that were carried forward from 2018, which had previously been carried back to the 2017 tax year; however because we expect to carryback our tax loss for the year ended December 31, 2019 to the 2017 tax year, a portion of those tax credits have been recaptured. Of the $3.8 million of tax credits recaptured and recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019, $0.2 million was recognized as a current income tax benefit and $3.6 million was recognized as a deferred income tax benefit in 2019. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nTax credits provided by the underlying projects of the historic tax credit partnerships are typically available in the tax year in which the project is put into active service, whereas the tax credits provided by qualified affordable housing project tax credit partnerships are provided over approximately a ten year period. The increase in tax credits recognized in 2019 was primarily attributable to our historic tax credit partnership investments.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure - Tax Equivalent Investment Result\nWe believe that to fully understand our investment returns it is important to consider the current tax benefits associated with certain investments as the tax benefit received represents a portion of the return provided by our tax-exempt bonds, BOLI, common and preferred stocks, and tax credit partnership investments (collectively, our tax-preferred investments). We impute a pro forma tax-equivalent result by estimating the amount of fully-taxable income needed to achieve the same after-tax result as is currently provided by our tax-preferred investments. We believe this better reflects the economics behind our decision to invest in certain asset classes that are either taxed at lower rates and/or result in reductions to our current federal income tax expense. Our pro forma tax-equivalent investment result is shown in the table that follows as well as a reconciliation of our GAAP net investment result to our tax equivalent result.\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP net investment result:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated subsidiaries\n</td> <td>(10,061\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP net investment result\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pro forma tax-equivalent investment result\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>125,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of pro forma and GAAP tax-equivalent investment result:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP net investment result\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Taxable equivalent adjustments, calculated using the 21% federal statutory tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>State and municipal bonds\n</td> <td>842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BOLI\n</td> <td>536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>527\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividends received\n</td> <td>489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>772\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax credit partnerships*\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pro forma tax-equivalent investment result\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>125,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>*Due to our consolidated pre-tax loss in 2019, the tax credits recognized from our tax credit partnership investments were deferred to be utilized in future periods;

We recognized OTTI in earnings of $0.5 million during 2018 related to debt instruments from two issuers in the energy sector.\nWe recognized $55.1 million of net realized investment gains during 2019, driven by both realized gains from the sale of equity investments and unrealized holding gains on our equity portfolio due to the improvement in the market since December 31, 2018, which caused our equity securities to increase in value. The most significant sectors that benefited from the improvement in the market were the financial and energy sectors.\nWe recognized $39.9 million of net realized investment losses during 2018, primarily driven by unrealized holding losses on our equity trading portfolio and, to a lesser extent, unrealized losses on convertible securities. The primary driver of these unrealized holding losses was market volatility throughout 2018, which caused our securities to decline in value. The most significant sectors impacted by the market volatility were the financial and energy sectors, although all sectors were impacted.\nOperating Expenses\nCorporate segment operating expenses were comprised as follows:\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management fee offset\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15,571\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15,670\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in operating expenses during 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily driven by an increase in employee benefits, primarily medical costs associated with employee health plans, and other one-time compensation related expenses as well as professional fees, largely offset by a decrease in share-based compensation expenses and, to a lesser extent, technology-related expenses. The decrease in share-based compensation expenses in 2019 was attributable to a decrease in value of the projected awards based on the decline of one of the associated performance metrics as well as fewer awards outstanding as compared to 2018. The decrease in technology expenses was due to an increase in the allocation of technology costs to the operating subsidiaries within our Specialty P&C and Workers' Compensation Insurance segments from our Corporate segment.\nOperating subsidiaries within our Specialty P&C and Workers' Compensation Insurance segments are charged a management fee by the Corporate segment for services provided to these subsidiaries. The management fee is based on the extent to which services are provided to the subsidiary and the amount of premium written by the subsidiary. Under the arrangement, the expenses associated with such services are reported as expenses of the Corporate segment, and the management fees charged are reported as an offset to Corporate operating expenses. While the terms of the arrangement were consistent between 2018 and 2019, fluctuations in the amount of premium written by each subsidiary can result in corresponding variations in the management fee charged to each subsidiary during a particular period.\nInterest Expense\nConsolidated interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was comprised as follows:\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Notes due 2023\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving Credit Agreement (including fees and amortization)\n</td> <td>645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(743\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53.5\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage Loans (including amortization)*\n</td> <td>1,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Gain)/loss on interest rate cap\n</td> <td>1,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(153\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(834.6\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>nm\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>* During 2019, we received nominal cash payments associated with our interest rate cap which were recorded as a reduction to interest expense associated with our Mortgage Loans.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated interest expense increased during 2019 as compared to 2018 driven by the change in the fair value of our interest rate cap. The interest rate cap is designated as an economic hedge of interest rate risk associated with our variable rate Mortgage Loans. Excluding the impact of the change in fair value of our interest rate cap, consolidated interest expense decreased during 2019 as compared to 2018 driven by lower interest expense on our Revolving Credit Agreement as we did not have any outstanding borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to weighted average outstanding borrowings of $41 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Interest expense on our Revolving Credit Agreement for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily reflected unused commitment fees as there were no outstanding borrowings during the period. See further discussion of our outstanding debt in Note 11 and further discussion of our interest rate cap agreement in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTaxes\nTax expense allocated to our Corporate segment includes U.S. tax only, which would include U.S. tax expense incurred from our corporate membership in Lloyd's of London and tax expense incurred from SPCs at Inova Re, one of our Cayman Islands reinsurance subsidiaries, as those SPCs elected to be taxed as U.S. taxpayers. The U.K. tax expense incurred by the U.K. based subsidiaries of our Lloyd's Syndicates segment is allocated to that segment. Consolidated tax expense reflects tax expense of both segments, as shown in the table below:\nTable 207: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate segment income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(29,808\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17,715\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lloyd's Syndicates segment income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(317\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(29,808\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(18,032\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBelow we list the primary factors affecting our consolidated effective tax rate in 2019 and 2018. The comparability of each factor's impact on our effective tax rate is affected by the consolidated pre-tax loss recognized in 2019 as compared to the consolidated pre-tax income recognized in 2018. Factors that have the same directional impact on income tax expense in each year have an opposite impact on our effective tax rate due to the effective tax rate being calculated based upon on a pre-tax loss in 2019 versus pre-tax income in 2018. These factors include the following:\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Income tax (benefit) expense\n</td> <td>Rate Impact\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Income tax (benefit) expense\n</td> <td>Rate Impact\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Computed \"expected\" tax expense (benefit) at statutory rate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,049\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>21.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax-exempt income*\n</td> <td>(1,528\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,505\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(8.6\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax credits\n</td> <td>(21,933\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>76.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,059\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(72.6\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-U.S. operating results\n</td> <td>(1,447\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Excess tax benefit on share-based compensation\n</td> <td>99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(275\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax rate differential on loss carryback\n</td> <td>(3,400\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>11.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision-to-return differences\n</td> <td>3,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.4\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,309\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(8.0\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in uncertain tax positions\n</td> <td>1,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.8\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(51\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>State income taxes\n</td> <td>(376\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefit from amended returns\n</td> <td>(550\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>(175\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(326\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(29,808\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>103.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(18,032\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(62.1\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>*Includes tax-exempt interest, dividends received deduction and change in cash surrender value of BOLI.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur effective tax rates for 2019 and 2018, as shown in the table above, resulted in an income tax benefit in both years and differs from the statutory federal income tax rate of 21% primarily due to the recognition of a tax benefit from credits transferred to us from our tax credit partnership investments in both 2019 and 2018 and, to a lesser extent, portions of our income that are exempt from federal income taxes. Our effective tax rate in 2019 was also affected by the tax rate differential on the carryback of our current year tax loss to the 2017 tax year when the federal statutory tax rate was 35% as compared to the current tax rate of 21%. Additionally, our effective tax rates in both 2019 and 2018 were impacted by provision-to-return differences. For 2019, these differences primarily reflected a lower amount of tax credits utilized in 2018 than the previously estimated tax benefit. For 2018, these differences primarily reflected the impact of the change in the federal corporate tax rate on our temporary provision-to-return differences as well as higher tax credits received for the 2017 tax year than the previously estimated tax benefit.", "item_7_truncated": "Policy acquisition costs (primarily commissions, premium taxes and underwriting salaries) which are directly related to the successful acquisition of new and renewal premiums are capitalized as DPAC and charged to expense, net of ceding commissions earned, as the related premium revenue is recognized.

made to related foreign entities referred to as the BEAT. The BEAT is imposed by adding back into the U.S. tax base any base erosion payment made by the U.S. taxpayer to a related foreign entity and applying a minimum tax rate to this newly calculated modified taxable income. Base erosion payments represent any amount paid or accrued by the U.S. taxpayer to a related foreign entity for which a deduction is allowed. Premiums we cede to the SPCs at Inova Re, one of our wholly owned Cayman Islands reinsurance subsidiaries, do not fall within the scope of base erosion payments as the SPCs at Inova Re intend to elect to be taxed as U.S. taxpayers. However, premiums that we cede to any active SPC at our other wholly owned Cayman Islands reinsurance subsidiary, Eastern Re, fall within the scope of base erosion payments and therefore could be significantly impacted by the BEAT. We have evaluated our exposure to the BEAT and have concluded that our expected outbound deductible payments to related foreign entities are below the threshold for application of the BEAT; therefore, we have not recognized any incremental tax expense for the BEAT provision of the TCJA for the year ended December 31, 2019.

the fair value of Eastern's loss reserve at the time of the acquisition. The fair value of the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses and related reinsurance recoverables was based on an actuarial estimate of the expected future net cash flows, a reduction of those cash flows for the time value of money determined utilizing the U.S. Treasury Yield Curve, and a risk adjustment to reflect the net present value of profit that an investor would demand in return for the assumption of the associated risks. Expected net cash flows were derived from the expected loss payment patterns included in an actuarial analysis of Eastern's reserve performed as of December 31, 2013. The fair value of the reserve, including the risk margin discussed above, exceeded the undiscounted loss reserve previously established by Eastern by $9.3 million; this fair value adjustment was amortized over the average expected life of the reserve of 6 years. The fair value adjustment has been fully amortized as of December 31, 2019.\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross premiums written\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Ceded premiums written\n</td> <td>9,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(38\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums written\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment's net loss ratio was affected by a $10 million reserve that an SPC at Eastern Re established during the second quarter of 2019. This SPC previously assumed an errors and omissions policy that provides coverage for losses up to a lifetime maximum of $10 million from a captive insurer unaffiliated with ProAssurance. During the second quarter of 2019, a claim was filed under this policy that met the lifetime maximum limit and, accordingly, a $10 million reserve was recorded. We do not participate in the SPC that assumed this policy; therefore, these losses are the obligation of the external cell participants and are reflected as an offset in the SPC dividend expense (income) and have no effect on our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment net operating results for the year ended December 31, 2019.

In addition to the interest and dividends we will receive, we anticipate that between $30 million and $80 million of our investments will mature (or be paid down) each quarter over the next twelve months and become available, if needed, to meet our cash flow requirements. The primary outflow of cash at our insurance subsidiaries is related to paid losses and operating costs, including income taxes. The payment of individual claims cannot be predicted with certainty; therefore, we rely upon the history of paid claims in estimating the timing of future claims payments. To the extent that we may have an unanticipated shortfall in cash, we may either liquidate securities or borrow funds under existing borrowing arrangements through our Revolving Credit Agreement and the FHLB system. As of February 14, 2020, $300 million could be made available for use through our Revolving Credit Agreement, as discussed in this section under the heading \"Debt.\" Given the duration of our investments, we do not foresee a shortfall that would require us to meet operating cash needs through additional borrowings.

After removing the effect of prior accident year ceded premium adjustments from both years, ceded premiums earned decreased $3.8 million in 2019 as compared to 2018. The remaining decrease was driven by the non-renewal of the quota share reinsurance agreement with Syndicate 1729, partially offset by the pro rata effect of an increase in premiums ceded under our shared risk arrangements during the preceding twelve months, predominantly in our CAPAssurance program.\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums ceded to SPCs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(128\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums ceded to external reinsurers\n</td> <td>13,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums ceded to unaffiliated captive insurers\n</td> <td>2,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,046\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(45.5\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in return premium estimate under external reinsurance\n</td> <td>328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(57\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(675.4\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total ceded premiums written\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,671\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\n\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In percentage points)\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n2019 versus 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated ratio increase (decrease) attributable to:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in actuarial adjustments related to the current accident year reserve in our Specialty P&C segment\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in DDR reserve adjustment\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>E&O reserve impact\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PDR\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other, net\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in the consolidated current accident year net loss ratio\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2019 the loss experience in our HCPL excess and surplus lines of business deteriorated further, particularly in regard to the reserves we established for a large national healthcare account, as previously discussed.

Our temporary differences principally relate to our loss reserves, unearned and advanced premiums, DPAC, compensation related items, unrealized investment gains (losses) and basis differences on fixed assets, intangible assets and operating leases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such benefits are realized. We review our deferred tax assets quarterly for impairment. If we determine that it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management is required to make certain judgments and assumptions about our future operations based on historical experience and information as of the measurement period regarding reversal of existing temporary differences, carryback capacity, future taxable income (including its capital and operating characteristics) and tax planning strategies.\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional liability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Physicians (1)(8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Twelve month term\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>367,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>352,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Twenty-four month term\n</td> <td>26,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Physicians\n</td> <td>393,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>374,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Healthcare facilities (2)(8)\n</td> <td>63,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,653\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other healthcare providers (3)\n</td> <td>34,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legal professionals (4)\n</td> <td>26,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tail coverages (5)(6)\n</td> <td>21,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,855\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.1\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retroactive coverages (6)\n</td> <td>900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17,808\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(95.2\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total professional liability\n</td> <td>540,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>542,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,740\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medical technology liability (7)\n</td> <td>35,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (9)\n</td> <td>2,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>335.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>577,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>577,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe risks insured in our medical technology liability business (3% of our consolidated gross reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2019) are more varied, and policies are individually priced based on the risk characteristics of the policy and the account. The insured risks range from startup operations to large multinational entities, and the larger entities often have significant deductibles or self-insured retentions. Reserves are established using our most recently developed actuarial estimates of losses expected to be incurred based on factors which include results from prior analysis of similar business, industry indications, observed trends and judgment. Claims in this line of business primarily involve bodily injury to individuals and are affected by factors similar to those of our HCPL line of business. For the medical technology liability business, we also establish an initial reserve using a loss ratio approach, including a provision in consideration of historical loss volatility that this line of

typically offered on a primary basis, within specified limits, to manufacturers and distributors of medical technology and life sciences products including entities conducting human clinical trials. In addition to the previously listed factors that affect our premium volume, our medical technology liability premium is impacted by the sales volume of insureds. The increase in 2019 was primarily due to new business written and, to a lesser extent, an increase in renewal pricing, largely offset by retention losses. Renewal pricing increases primarily reflect increases in the sales volume and exposure of certain insureds. Retention losses in 2019 are primarily attributable to an increase in competition on terms and pricing. \nAlthough the future degree and impact of the ultimate severity trend remains uncertain due to the long-tailed nature of our business, we have given consideration to observed loss costs in setting our rates. For our HCPL business, this practice had generally resulted in rate reductions as claim frequency declined and remained at historically low levels. For example, on average, excluding our podiatry business acquired in 2009, we had gradually reduced the premium rates we charged on our standard physician renewal business (our largest HCPL line) by approximately 17% from the beginning of 2006 to December 31, 2016.\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ROE\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(2.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe evaluate each of our ceded reinsurance contracts at inception to confirm that there is sufficient risk transfer to allow the contract to be accounted for as reinsurance under current accounting guidance.

Tail coverage premiums are generally 100% earned in the period written because the policies insure only incidents that occurred in prior periods and are not cancellable. The amount of tail coverage premium written can vary significantly from period to period. The decrease in tail premiums in 2019 was driven by $7.9 million of tail coverage provided in connection with a loss portfolio transfer entered into during the second quarter of 2018, partially offset by $1.8 million of tail coverage provided in connection with a loss portfolio transfer entered into during the third quarter of 2019. \nThe process of estimating reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. These variables can be affected by both views of internal and external events, such as changes in views of economic inflation, legal trends and legislative changes, as well as differentiating views of individuals involved in the reserve estimation process, among others. We continually refine our estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical loss experience develops and additional claims are reported and settled. Our objective is to consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the time.\nAs a result of actuarial analyses performed by both internal and consulting actuaries during 2019, we concluded that additional reserves were needed in our Specialty P&C segment. As such, we recorded $5.7 million of net unfavorable development on our prior accident year reserves and recorded a higher current accident year net loss ratio which resulted in a net loss ratio of 106.7% in 2019. Furthermore, net losses and loss adjustment expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 included a $9.2 million PDR which represents an estimated premium deficiency associated with the unearned premium related to a large national healthcare account.

Our consolidated gross reserve for losses on a GAAP basis exceeds the combined gross reserves of our insurance subsidiaries on a statutory basis by approximately $0.2 billion, which is principally due to the portion of the GAAP reserve for losses that is reflected for statutory accounting purposes as unearned premiums. These unearned premiums are applicable to extended reporting endorsements ( tail\u201d coverage) issued without a premium charge upon death, disability or retirement of an insured who meets certain qualifications.\nWe provide capital to Lloyd's of London Syndicate 1729 and Syndicate 6131 which represents 11% of our gross premiums written in 2019. As previously discussed, to reduce our exposure and the associated earnings volatility, we decreased our participation in the operating results of Syndicate 1729 for the 2020 underwriting year from 61% to 29%. Our allocated share of Syndicate 1729's maximum underwriting capacity for 2020 is \u00a339 million (approximately $51 million at December 31, 2019). We continue to provide 100% of the capital to Syndicate 6131 which has a maximum underwriting capacity for the 2020 underwriting year of \u00a312 million (approximately $15.9 million at December 31, 2019).\n \u2022 The section entitled Cumulative net paid, as of\u201d reflects the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of each succeeding year with respect to the previously recorded Balance Sheet Reserves. \nIn addition, segment operating results for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 included the effect of two separate loss portfolio transfers; one entered into during the third quarter of 2019 and one entered into during the second quarter of 2018. A loss portfolio transfer is a form of retroactive insurance coverage as we are assuming and accepting an entity's existing open and future claim liabilities through the transfer of the entity's loss reserves. The loss portfolio transfer entered into during the third quarter of 2019 resulted in total net premiums written and earned of $2.7 million (consisting of $0.9 million of retroactive premium and $1.8 million of prospective (tail) premium) and total net losses and loss adjustment expenses of $2.1 million. The loss portfolio transfer entered into during the second quarter of 2018 resulted in total net premiums written and earned of $26.6 million (consisting of $18.7 million of retroactive premium and $7.9 million of prospective (tail) premium) and total net losses and loss adjustment expenses of $25.4 million. See further discussion of these loss portfolio transfers in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nthe loss of three accounts. The decrease in retrospective policy premiums written primarily reflects the loss of two accounts and the impact of retrospective premium adjustments which are based on the loss experience of the underlying policies. Retrospective premium adjustments in 2019 decreased premiums written by $2.1 million as compared to adjustments in 2018 that increased premiums written by $0.8 million. Other premiums written primarily reflect our participation in residual market pools in the states in which we operate; premiums are based on information provided to us by the residual market.\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Excess of loss reinsurance arrangements (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(577\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premium ceded to Syndicate 1729 (2)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,105\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>nm\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other shared risk arrangements (3)\n</td> <td>33,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premium ceded to SPCs (4)\n</td> <td>6,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other ceded premiums written\n</td> <td>3,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(44\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustment to premiums owed under reinsurance agreements, prior accident years, net (5)\n</td> <td>2,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,691\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48.7\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total ceded premiums written\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,098\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe principal components of our operating cash flows are the excess of premiums collected and net investment income over losses paid and operating costs, including income taxes.

The current accident year net loss ratio, excluding the effect of prior year ceded premium adjustments (as shown in the table above), increased 12.1 percentage points as compared to 2018. The change in the current accident year net loss ratio was primarily attributable to the following: \nOur operating ratio for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 increased by approximately 17.6 percentage points driven by a higher combined ratio in our Specialty P&C segment. The higher combined ratio in our Specialty P&C segment was driven by a higher current accident year net loss ratio and the recognition of net unfavorable development on prior accident year reserves. See previous discussion in this section under the heading \"Expenses\" and further discussion in our Segment Operating Results - Specialty Property & Casualty section that follows under the heading \"Losses.\"\nFor the workers' compensation business, each SPC has in place its own external reinsurance arrangements. The healthcare professional liability business is assumed net of reinsurance from our Specialty P&C segment; therefore, there are no ceded premiums related to the healthcare professional liability business reflected in the table above. The risk retention for each loss occurrence for the workers' compensation business ranges from $0.3 million to $0.35 million based on the program, with limits up to $119.7 million. In addition, each program has aggregate reinsurance coverage between $1.1 million and $2.1 million on a program year basis. Per the SPC external reinsurance agreements, premiums are ceded on a written premium basis and changes in ceded premiums written during 2019 primarily reflected changes in gross premiums written as compared to 2018. External reinsurance rates vary based on the alternative market program.\nNet premiums earned consist of gross premiums earned less the portion of earned premiums that we cede to our reinsurers for their assumption of a portion of our losses. Because premiums are generally earned pro rata over the entire policy period, fluctuations in premiums earned tend to lag those of premiums written. Generally, our policies carry a term of one year; however, as discussed above, we write certain policies with a twenty-four month term, and a few of our medical technology liability policies have a multi-year term. Tail coverage premiums are generally 100% earned in the period written because the policies insure only incidents that occurred in prior periods and are not cancellable. Retroactive coverage premiums are 100% earned at the inception of the contract, as all of the underlying loss events occurred in the past. Additionally, ceded premium changes due to changes to estimates of premiums owed under reinsurance agreements for prior accident years are fully earned in the period of change.\nFinancing Activities and Related Cash Flows\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Traditional business:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Guaranteed cost\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>158,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>163,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,892\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.0\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policyholder dividend\n</td> <td>20,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(757\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.6\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deductible\n</td> <td>5,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,286\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28.1\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retrospective\n</td> <td>2,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,926\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(56.8\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>8,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(753\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.0\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Alternative market business\n</td> <td>82,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,174\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.6\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>278,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>293,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14,788\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.0\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAcquired Reserve\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>Carrying Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>GAAP Measurement Method\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other investments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, principally FHLB capital stock\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Principally Cost\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment in unconsolidated subsidiaries:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments in tax credit partnerships\n</td> <td>48.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Equity\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity method investments, primarily LPs/LLCs\n</td> <td>39.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Equity\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>88.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BOLI\n</td> <td>66.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cash surrender value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investments - Other valuation methodologies\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>157.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDevelopment of Prior Accident Years\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(28,804\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(57,829\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>200.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>(29,808\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18,032\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,776\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>39.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(46,053\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(4,587.0\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>103.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(62.1\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>165.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) We generally reinsure risks under our excess of loss reinsurance arrangements pursuant to which the reinsurers agree to assume all or a portion of all risks that we insure above our individual risk retention levels, up to the maximum individual limits offered. Premium due to reinsurers also fluctuates with the volume of written premium subject to cession under the arrangement. In certain of our excess of loss reinsurance arrangements, the premium due to the reinsurer is determined by the loss experience of that business reinsured, subject to certain minimum and maximum amounts. Due to increases in loss experience of business reinsured under those loss sensitive agreements and resulting increases in premium due to those reinsurers, we have reached the maximum level of premium due under those arrangements which is driving the decrease in ceded premiums written in 2019 as compared to 2018. \nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined ratio\n</td> <td>118.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: investment income ratio\n</td> <td>11.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating ratio\n</td> <td>107.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe financial strength of our reinsurers and their ability to pay us may change in the future due to forces or events we cannot control or anticipate. We have not experienced significant collection difficulties due to the financial condition of any reinsurer as of December 31, 2019; however, reinsurers may periodically dispute our demand for reimbursement from them based upon their interpretation of the terms of our agreements. As of December 31, 2019, reinsurance recoverables totaling approximately $92.6 million were collateralized by letters of credit or funds withheld. We had no allowance for credit losses related to our reinsurance receivables at December 31, 2019 or 2018 as all reinsurance balances were considered collectible. No reinsurance balances were written off for credit reasons during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, and reinsurance balances written off for credit reasons during the year ended December 31, 2017 were nominal in amount. Should future events lead us to believe that any reinsurer will not meet its obligations to us, adjustments to the amounts recoverable would be reflected in the results of current operations. Such an adjustment has the potential to be material to the results of operations in the period in which it is recorded; however, we would not expect such an adjustment to have a material effect on our capital position or our liquidity.\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

The estimation of long-tailed losses is inherently difficult and is subject to significant judgment on the part of management. Due to the nature of our claims, our loss costs, even for claims with similar characteristics, can vary significantly depending upon many factors, including but not limited to the specific characteristics of the claim and the manner in which the claim is resolved. Long-tailed insurance is characterized by the extended period of time typically required both to assess the viability of a claim and potential damages, if any, and to reach a resolution of the claim. The claims resolution process may extend to more than five years. The combination of continually changing conditions and the extended time required for claim resolution results in a loss cost estimation process that requires actuarial skill and the application of significant judgment, and such estimates require periodic modification.\n\nActivity in our net reserve for losses during 2019, 2018 and 2017 is summarized below:\n\nTreasury share activity for 2019, 2018 and 2017 was as follows:\nCeded Premiums Ratio\n\n \u2022 Reserves for 2014 include gross and net reserves acquired in 2014 business combinations of $153.2 million and $139.5 million, respectively.  In each year reflected in the table, we have estimated our reserve for losses utilizing the management and actuarial processes discussed under the heading \"Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\" in the Critical Accounting Estimates section. Factors that have contributed to the variation in loss development are primarily related to the extended period of time required to resolve professional liability claims and include the following:\nDeferred Taxes\nBecause of the number of securities we own and the complexity of developing accurate fair values, we utilize multiple independent pricing services to assist us in establishing the fair value of individual securities. The pricing services provide fair values based on exchange-traded prices, if available. If an exchange-traded price is not available, the pricing services, if possible, provide a fair value that is based on multiple broker/dealer quotes or that has been developed using pricing models. Pricing models vary by asset class and utilize currently available market data for securities comparable to ours to estimate a fair value for our securities. The pricing services scrutinize market data for consistency with other relevant market information before including the data in the pricing models. The pricing services disclose the types of pricing models used and the inputs used for each asset class. Determining fair values using these pricing models requires the use of judgment to identify appropriate comparable securities and to choose a valuation methodology that is appropriate for the asset class and available data.\n\nCeded Premiums Written\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>Traditional Business\n</td> <td>Alternative Market Business\n</td> <td>Segment\nResults\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Traditional Business\n</td> <td>Alternative Market Business\n</td> <td>Segment\nResults\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New business\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Audit premium (including EBUB)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retention (1)\n</td> <td>79\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>83\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in renewal pricing (2)\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) We calculate our workers' compensation retention as annualized expiring renewed premium divided by all annualized expiring premium subject to renewal.

The estimate of fair value derived from the income approach is based on the present value of expected future cash flows, including terminal value, utilizing a market based weighted average cost of capital determined separately for each reporting unit. The estimate of fair value derived from the market approach is based on earnings multiple data derived from market information. The determination of fair value involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates, operating margins, capital expenditures, working capital requirements, tax rates, terminal growth rates, discount rates, comparable public companies and synergistic benefits available to market participants. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units to determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit. To corroborate the reporting units' valuation, we perform a reconciliation of the estimate of the aggregate fair value of the reporting units to ProAssurance's market capitalization, including consideration of a control premium. Because not all of our reporting units have goodwill, we make certain assumptions regarding the fair value of our other reporting units in reconciling to our market capitalization.\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specialty P&C segment(1)\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Physicians(1)(2)\n</td> <td>88\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Healthcare facilities(1)(2)\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other healthcare providers(1)\n</td> <td>88\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legal professionals\n</td> <td>88\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medical technology liability\n</td> <td>88\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Excludes certain policies written on an excess and surplus lines basis as the terms and conditions of these policies are not consistent between periods.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2) See Gross Premiums Written section for further explanation of retention decline in 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\n\nWe have a Revolving Credit Agreement which may be used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, short-term working capital, share repurchases as authorized by the Board and support for other activities.

operating expenses of $8.1 million. The increase in paid losses was driven by our Specialty P&C and Workers' Compensation Insurance segments. The increase in paid losses in our Specialty P&C segment primarily reflected higher average claims payments in 2019 as compared to 2018 and the increase in paid losses in our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment primarily reflected the timing of loss payments between periods. The decrease in cash received from investment income was primarily due to a decline in distributed earnings from our unconsolidated subsidiaries.

Estimated ultimate premium consists primarily of premium written under delegated underwriting authority arrangements, which consist primarily of binding authorities, and certain assumed reinsurance agreements. These estimates of ultimate premium are judgmental and are dependent upon certain assumptions, including historical premium trends for similar agreements. As reports are received from programs, ultimate premium estimates are revised, if necessary, with changes reflected in current operations.\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except per share data)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Items excluded in the calculation of Non-GAAP operating income (loss):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized investment (gains) losses\n</td> <td>(59,874\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized gains (losses) attributable to SPCs which no profit/loss is retained (1)\n</td> <td>3,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,535\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Guaranty fund assessments (recoupments)\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pre-tax effect of exclusions\n</td> <td>(56,687\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax effect, at 21% (2)\n</td> <td>11,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,631\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>After-tax effect of exclusions\n</td> <td>(44,783\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(43,779\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Per diluted common share:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exclusions\n</td> <td>(0.83\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.60\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP operating income (loss) per diluted common share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.81\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nInvestments in tax credit partnerships are evaluated for OTTI by considering both qualitative and quantitative factors.

These arrangements include our Ascension Health and CAPAssurance programs. While we cede a large portion of the premium written under these arrangements, they provide us an opportunity to grow net premium through strategic partnerships. The increase in 2019 was primarily driven by growth in our CAPAssurance program, partially offset by a decrease in exposure related to one of our Ascension Health programs. \nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net impairment losses recognized in earnings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(751\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(490\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(261\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53.3\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other net realized investment gains (losses)\n</td> <td>60,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(42,998\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>241.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized investment gains (losses)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(43,488\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>103,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>237.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet premiums earned were as follows:\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums written\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums earned\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>1,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized gains (losses)\n</td> <td>4,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,149\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>7,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(227.7\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net losses and loss adjustment expenses\n</td> <td>(52,412\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(38,726\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(13,686\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>35.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting, policy acquisition and operating expenses(1)\n</td> <td>(24,260\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(22,426\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1,834\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SPC net operating results\n</td> <td>8,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,368\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(29.5\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SPC dividend (expense) income(2)\n</td> <td>(4,579\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(9,122\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>4,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(49.8\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating results(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss ratio\n</td> <td>66.7%\n</td> <td>52.4%\n</td> <td>14.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting expense ratio(1)\n</td> <td>30.9%\n</td> <td>30.3%\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>pts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Underwriting, policy acquisition and operating expenses in both 2019 and 2018 included a provision for U.S. federal income taxes of $1.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively, for SPCs at Inova Re that have elected to be taxed as U.S. taxpayers.

The decrease in premiums ceded to Syndicate 1729 during 2019 is due to the non-renewal of the quota share reinsurance agreement with Syndicate 1729 on January 1, 2018; the impact of which was not reflected in ceded premiums written until the second quarter of 2018 due to the previously mentioned quarter lag. See the Segment Operating Results - Lloyd's Syndicates section for further discussion on the quota share agreement. \nUnder the terms of certain of our reinsurance agreements, the amount of premium that we cede to our reinsurers is based in part on the losses we recover under the agreements. Therefore, we make an estimate of premiums ceded under these reinsurance agreements subject to certain maximums and minimums. Any adjustments to our estimates of losses recoverable under our reinsurance agreements or the premiums owed under our agreements are reflected in then current operations. Due to the size of our reinsurance balances, an adjustment to these estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is made.\nThe pricing services provide a single value per instrument quoted. We review the values provided for reasonableness each quarter by comparing market yields generated by the supplied value versus market yields observed in the marketplace. We also compare yields indicated by the provided values to appropriate benchmark yields and review for values that are unchanged or that reflect an unanticipated variation as compared to prior period values. We utilize a primary pricing service for each security type and compare provided information for consistency with alternate pricing services, known market data and information from our own trades, considering both values and valuation trends. We also review weekly trades versus the prices supplied by the services. If a supplied value appears unreasonable, we discuss the valuation in question with the pricing service and make adjustments if deemed necessary. Historically our review has not resulted in any material changes to the values supplied by the pricing services. The pricing services do not provide a fair value unless an exchange-traded price or multiple observable inputs are available. As a result, the pricing services may provide a fair value for a security in some periods but not others, depending upon the level of recent market activity for the security or comparable securities.\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>Carrying\nValue\n</td> <td>% of Total Investment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Carrying\nValue\n</td> <td>% of Total Investment\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rating*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AAA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>677,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>645,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AA+\n</td> <td>84,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AA\n</td> <td>152,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AA-\n</td> <td>153,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>A+\n</td> <td>182,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>190,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>A\n</td> <td>338,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>311,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>A-\n</td> <td>171,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>146,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BBB+\n</td> <td>182,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>133,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BBB\n</td> <td>155,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>118,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BBB-\n</td> <td>52,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Below investment grade\n</td> <td>130,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Not rated\n</td> <td>6,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,288,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,093,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>*Average of three NRSRO sources, presented as an S&P equivalent.

Also as a result of our annual actuarial analysis, we increased our reserves related to DDR coverage endorsements in 2019 as compared to a decrease in 2018 which accounted for 2.9 percentage points of the increase in the current accident year net loss ratio. Furthermore, as part of our quarterly evaluation of the recoverability of DPAC, we recognized a PDR of $9.2 million which accounted for 1.9 percentage points of the increase in the current accident year net loss ratio. The PDR represents an estimated premium deficiency associated with the unearned premium of the aforementioned large national healthcare account which is reflected as a component of our current accident year net losses; no such reserves were established in 2018. The remaining increase in our current accident year net loss ratio of 1.3 percentage points was primarily due to changes in the mix of business. Current accident year loss ratios for our core physicians, podiatric, chiropractic, legal professional liability and medical technology liability businesses were relatively unchanged as compared to 2018.\n \u2022 if it is more likely than not that the security will be required to be sold before full recovery of its amortized cost basis; or \n \u2022 Catastrophic protection is utilized on both our property insurance and casualty coverages to protect against losses in excess of policy limits as well as natural catastrophes. \n\nA schedule of our non-cancellable contractual obligations at December 31, 2019 was as follows:\nPremiums Written\nended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily reflected an increase in the provision for federal income taxes and fees related to letters of credit posted as program collateral. The provision for federal income taxes totaled $1.1 million and $0.4 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nIn 2019, 2018 and 2017 the development was largely attributable to favorable results from claims closed during the year. As time has elapsed we have recognized that actual loss experience has on average been better than estimated. We have been cautious in recognizing the improvement, but as claims have matured and claims are closed or have become more certain for the remaining open claims, we have revised reserve estimates. We believe the need for a cautious approach is required as outcomes are uncertain and results can be significantly affected by outcomes for a small number of cases.\nWe are involved in various legal actions related to insurance policies and claims handling including, but not limited to, claims asserted against us by policyholders. These types of legal actions arise in the ordinary course of business and, in accordance with GAAP for insurance entities, are generally considered as a part of our loss reserving process, which is described in detail in our Critical Accounting Estimates section under the heading \"Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses.\" We also have other direct actions against the Company unrelated to our claims activity which we evaluate and account for as a part of our other liabilities. For these corporate legal actions, we evaluate each case separately and establish what we believe is an appropriate reserve based on GAAP guidance related to contingent liabilities. As of December 31, 2019 there were no material reserves established for corporate legal actions.\nExecutive Summary of Operations\nCertain of our investments, in accordance with GAAP for the type of investment, are measured using methodologies other than fair value. At December 31, 2019, these investments represented approximately 5% of total investments, and are detailed in the following table. Additional information about these investments is provided in Notes 2 and 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nSegment Operating Results - Workers' Compensation Insurance\nConsolidated net premiums earned for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 included the effects of two different loss portfolio transfers in our Specialty P&C segment which resulted in $2.7 million and $26.6 million, respectively, of one-time premium written and fully earned in the respective periods. See further discussion of these loss portfolio transfers in our Segment Operating Results - Specialty Property & Casualty section that follows. After removing the impacts of the 2019 and 2018 loss portfolio transfers, consolidated net premiums earned increased $52.6 million during 2019 as compared to 2018. All of our operating segments contributed to the remaining increase in consolidated net premiums earned, particularly our Specialty P&C segment due to the pro rata effect of an increase in the volume of written premium during the preceding twelve months, predominantly in our physicians and healthcare facilities lines of business, driven by an increase in renewal pricing.\n(1) Net realized investment gains (losses) on investments related to SPCs are recognized in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment. SPC operating results, including any realized gain or loss, that are attributable to external cell participants are reflected in the SPC dividend expense (income). To be consistent with our exclusion of net realized investment gains (losses) recognized in earnings, we are excluding the portion of net realized investment gains (losses) that is included in the SPC dividend expense (income) which is attributable to the external cell participants.\nGross, ceded and net premiums written were as follows:\n \u2022 in situations where there was not a previous OTTI for the investment, whether the current expected cash flows from the investment, primarily tax benefits, are less than those expected at the time the investment was acquired due to various factors, such as a change in the statutory tax rate; or \nOur operating ratio is our combined ratio, less our investment income ratio. This ratio provides the combined effect of underwriting profitability and investment income. Our operating ratio for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was as follows:\nPremiums Written\n \u2022 Lloyd's Syndicates - This segment includes the operating results from our participation (61% for the 2019 underwriting year) in Lloyd's of London Syndicate 1729 and our 100% participation in Syndicate 6131, which is an SPA that underwrites on a quota share basis with Syndicate 1729. To reduce our exposure and the associated earnings volatility, we decreased our participation in the operating results of Syndicate 1729 for the 2020 underwriting year from 61% to 29%. The results of this segment are normally reported on a quarter lag, except when information is available that is material to the current period. Syndicate 1729 underwrites risks over a wide range of property and casualty insurance and reinsurance lines in both the U.S. and international markets while \naffect our income tax expense, and settlement of uncertain tax positions may require the use of cash. Other than differences related to timing, no significant adjustments were considered necessary during 2019 or 2018. At December 31, 2019, our liability for unrecognized tax benefits approximated $5.1 million.\nNet Premiums Earned\nCalendar year incurred losses (excluding IBNR) ceded to our external reinsurers decreased $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. Current accident year ceded incurred losses decreased $5.5 million as compared to 2018. The decrease in losses ceded to our external reinsurers primarily reflects the impact of the AAD, which reduced ceded losses by $3.9 million, and a reduction in reported reinsured claims during 2019.\n \u2022 The investment income ratio which is calculated as net investment income divided by net premiums earned and measures the contribution investment earnings provide to our overall profitability. \nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP. Preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts we report on those statements. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based on current and historical developments, market conditions, industry trends and other information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We can make no assurance that actual results will conform to our estimates and assumptions; reported results of operations may be materially affected by changes in these estimates and assumptions.\nLosses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nHowever, from early 2017 to December 31, 2019, the average charged premium rates on our standard physician renewal business have increased by approximately 4% per annum, and we anticipate further rate increases due to indications of increasing loss severity.\nWhen a lease of an office facility is to be abandoned and will not be subleased, we first evaluate whether or not the operating lease ROU asset's inclusion in an existing asset group continues to be appropriate and if the commitment to abandon the lease constitutes a change in circumstances requiring the operating lease ROU asset, or the larger asset group, to be tested for impairment. If an impairment test is required, it is performed in the same manner as discussed above. Any remaining carrying value of the operating lease ROU asset is amortized from the date we commit to a plan to abandon the lease to the expected date that we will cease to use the leased property. Leases to be abandoned in which we have the intent or practical ability to sublease continue to be accounted for under a held and use model, with no change to the amortization period of the operating lease ROU asset, and are evaluated for impairment as a separate asset group at the date the sublease is executed.\n\nUnderwriting, Policy Acquisition and Operating Expenses\nThe table includes losses on both a direct and an assumed basis and is net of anticipated reinsurance recoverables. The gross liability for losses before reinsurance, as shown on the balance sheet, and the reconciliation of that gross liability to amounts net of reinsurance are reflected below the table. We do not discount our reserve for losses to present value. Information presented in the table is cumulative and, accordingly, each amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts for prior years. The table presents the development of our balance sheet reserve for losses; it does not present accident year or policy year development data. Conditions and trends that have affected the development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur in the future. Accordingly, it is not appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based on this table.\nThe largest component of our liabilities is our reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses (\"reserve for losses\" or \"reserve\"), and the largest component of expense for our operations is incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as losses and loss adjustment expenses,\u201d incurred losses,\u201d losses incurred\u201d and losses\u201d). Incurred losses reported in any period reflect our estimate of losses incurred related to the premiums earned in that period as well as any changes to our previous estimate of the reserve required for prior periods.\nWe recognized net favorable prior year development of $10.1 million and $9.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The net favorable prior year reserve development for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily reflected overall favorable trends in claim closing patterns, primarily in the 2015 through 2018 accident years. The net favorable prior year reserve development for the year ended December 31, 2018 also primarily reflected overall favorable trends in claim closing patterns, primarily in the 2015 through 2017 accident years.\nIn addition to setting the initial reserve for the current accident year, each period we reassess the amount of reserve required for prior accident years.\nAs previously noted, the number of data points and variables considered and the subjective process followed in establishing our loss reserve makes it impractical to isolate individual variables and demonstrate their impact on our estimate of loss reserves. However, to provide a better understanding of the potential variability in our reserves, we have modeled implied reserve ranges around our single point net reserve estimates for our various lines of business assuming different confidence levels. The ranges have been developed by aggregating the expected volatility of losses across partitions of our business to obtain a consolidated distribution of potential reserve outcomes. The aggregation of this data takes into consideration correlations among our geographic and specialty mix of business. The result of the correlation approach to aggregation is that the ranges are narrower than the sum of the ranges determined for each partition.\n \u2022 ROE which is calculated as net income divided by the average of beginning and ending shareholders' equity. This ratio measures our overall after-tax profitability and shows how efficiently capital is being used. \nFor the workers' compensation business ceded to Inova Re and Eastern Re, each SPC has in place its own reinsurance arrangements; which are illustrated in the following table.\n\nWe have also been a consistent acquirer of other physician insurers, completing four acquisitions between 2009 and 2013 as well as acquiring an agency largely focused on the professional liability needs of allied healthcare providers, an insurer focused on the legal professional liability market and a mutual company that focused on medical technology liability insurance for companies that manufacture or distribute medical products.\nThe following table shows our total consolidated net realized investment gains (losses):\n \u2022 the current credit standing of the issuer, including credit rating downgrades, whether before or after the balance sheet date; \nExcluding the impact of the errors and omissions liability policy, as shown above, the current accident year net loss ratio increased in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to an increase in severity-related claims activity.\nAt December 31, 2019, our debt included $250 million of outstanding unsecured senior notes. The notes bear interest at 5.3% annually and are due in 2023 although they may be redeemed in whole or part prior to maturity. There are no financial covenants associated with these notes.\nReinsurance\nAt December 31, 2019, there were no outstanding borrowings on our Revolving Credit Agreement; however, the above table includes unused commitment fees associated with our Revolving Credit Agreement as we presume the full unused facility will remain available through expiration of the agreement in November 2024. Additionally, we presume the current interest rate on our Mortgage Loans at December 31, 2019 will remain constant until maturity of the Mortgage Loans in December 2027. For more information regarding these agreements see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n \u2022 the extent to which the decline in fair value is attributable to credit risk specifically associated with the security or its issuer; \nThe increase in our alternative market healthcare facilities premium during 2019 was primarily due to new business written, including the addition of one large policy totaling $1.4 million. The remaining increase was attributable to multiple short-term policies written throughout 2018 that renewed on January 1, 2019 with twelve month terms.\nExcluding the effects of audit premium and the provision for U.S. federal income taxes, the underwriting expense ratio primarily reflected the weighted average ceding commission percentage of all SPC programs.\n\nWe recognized net favorable development related to our previously established reserves of $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $8.0 million for 2018. The net favorable prior year development for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 reflected overall favorable trends in claim closing patterns, primarily in the 2015 and 2016 accident years. For each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the net favorable prior year development included $1.6 million related to the amortization of the purchase accounting fair value adjustment. The fair value adjustment has been fully amortized as of December 31, 2019.\n2018 in our Specialty P&C segment (see further discussion in our Segment Operating Results - Specialty Property & Casualty section that follows). Excluding the impact of the 2018 loss portfolio transfer, our consolidated underwriting expense ratio for 2019 was relatively unchanged as compared to 2018 driven by an increase in consolidated net premiums earned which outpaced the increase in consolidated DPAC amortization, offset by an increase operating expenses in our Specialty P&C segment driven by fees associated with a data analytics services agreement entered into during the fourth quarter of 2018.\nFor all of our segments, we make a determination of the amount of insurance risk we choose to retain based upon numerous factors, including our risk tolerance and the capital we have to support it, the price and availability of reinsurance, the volume of business, our level of experience with a particular set of claims and our analysis of the potential underwriting results. We purchase excess of loss reinsurance to limit the amount of risk we retain and we do so from a number of companies to mitigate concentrations of credit risk. We utilize reinsurance brokers to assist us in the placement of these reinsurance programs and in the analysis of the credit quality of our reinsurers. The determination of which reinsurers we choose to do business with is based upon an evaluation of their then current financial strength, rating and stability. However, the financial strength of our reinsurers and their corresponding ability to pay us may change in the future due to forces or events we cannot control or anticipate. As of December 31, 2019, there is no reinsurer, on an individual basis, for which our recoverables for both paid and unpaid claims (net of amounts due to the reinsurer) and our prepaid balances are aggregately $40 million or more.\nWe utilize the selected point estimates of ultimate losses to develop estimates of ultimate losses recoverable from reinsurers, based on the terms and conditions of our reinsurance agreements. An overall estimate of the amount receivable from reinsurers is determined by combining the individual estimates. Our net reserve estimate is the gross reserve point estimate less the estimated reinsurance recovery.\n\n\nOur Specialty P&C segment focuses on professional liability insurance and medical technology liability insurance as discussed in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment operating results reflected pre-tax underwriting profit or loss from these insurance lines, exclusive of investment results, which are included in our Corporate segment. Segment operating results included the following:\n \u2022 Reserves for 2009 and thereafter include gross and net reserves acquired in 2009 business combinations of $169.4 million and $163.9 million, respectively. \nWe believe our position in the healthcare liability space is strengthened by our ability to offer synergistic solutions through our operations at Eastern, a provider of workers' compensation insurance which currently represents the second largest product line in our gross premiums written (28% in 2019, including alternative market premiums). The workers' compensation industry is highly competitive in the geographic markets in which we operate and multi-line insurers continue to increase their leverage of workers' compensation business in their product offerings. We believe our workers' compensation product offerings allow us to provide flexibility in offering solutions to our customers at a competitive price. In addition, we believe that our claims handling and risk management services are attractive to our customers and provide us with a competitive advantage even when our pricing is higher than our competitors.\nGross premiums written reflected reinsurance premiums assumed by component as follows:\nThe foundation of our reserve re-estimation process is an actuarial analysis that is performed by both our internal and consulting actuaries. This very detailed analysis projects ultimate losses based on partitions which include line of business, geography, coverage layer and accident year. The procedure uses the most representative data for each partition, capturing its unique patterns of development and trends. In all there are over 200 different partitions of our business for purposes of this analysis. We believe that the use of consulting actuaries provides an independent view of our loss data as well as a broader perspective on industry loss trends.\nTaxes\nEach SPC has participants and the profit or loss of each cell accrues fully to these cell participants. As previously discussed, we participate in certain SPCs to a varying degree. Each SPC maintains a loss fund initially equal to the difference between premium assumed by the cell and the ceding commission. The external participants of each cell provide collateral, typically in the form of a letter of credit, to us that is initially equal to the difference between the loss fund of the SPC (amount of funds available to pay losses after deduction of ceding commission) and the aggregate attachment point of the reinsurance. Over time, an SPC's retained profits are considered in the determination of the collateral amount required to be provided by the cell's external participants.\nSyndicate 6131 focuses on contingency and specialty property business, also within the U.S. and international markets.\nOur effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were different from the statutory federal income tax rates in effect for each year primarily due to the recognition of a tax benefit from credits transferred to us from our tax credit partnership investments and, to a lesser extent, portions of our income that are exempt from federal income taxes. See further discussion, including other notable items during 2019 and 2018 in the Segment Operating Results - Corporate section that follows under the heading \"Taxes.\"\n \u2022 Reserves for 2012 and thereafter include gross and net reserves acquired in 2012 business combinations of $21.8 million and $19.2 million, respectively, which considers reductions of $3.6 million and $3.3 million, respectively, recorded in 2013 due to the re-estimation of the fair value of the acquired reserves. \nUnder our external reinsurance agreement, we retain the first $0.5 million in risk insured by us and cede losses in excess of this amount on each loss occurrence under our primary external reinsurance treaty. Effective May 1, 2019, our primary reinsurance layer was renewed with an AAD equal to the greater of $3.9 million or 2.1% of subject premium, in excess of the $0.5 million retention per loss occurrence, and the elimination of the return premium component of the contract. The addition of the AAD was partially offset by a reduction in the reinsurance rates under our renewed treaty. Per our reinsurance agreements, we cede premiums related to our traditional business on an earned premium basis. The increase in premiums ceded to external\n \u2022 third-party research and credit rating reports; \nOur receivable from reinsurers on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses represents our estimate of the amount of our reserve for losses that will be recoverable under our reinsurance programs. We base our estimate of funds recoverable upon our expectation of ultimate losses and the portion of those losses that we estimate to be allocable to reinsurers based upon the terms and conditions of our reinsurance agreements. Our assessment of the collectability of the recorded amounts receivable from reinsurers considers the payment history of the reinsurer, publicly available financial and rating agency data, our interpretation of the underlying contracts and policies and responses by reinsurers.\n \u2022 These adverse severity trends later moderated, with that moderation becoming more pronounced beginning in 2009. We were cautious in giving full recognition to indications that the pace of severity increase had slowed, however we gave measured recognition of the improved trend in our reserve estimates. The favorable development was most pronounced for years 2004 to 2008, as the initial reserves for these accident years were established prior to substantial indication that severity trends were moderating. We gave stronger recognition to the lower severity trend as time elapsed and a greater percentage of claims were closed. \nWe have Mortgage Loans with one lender in connection with the recapitalization of two office buildings, which mature in December 2027. The Mortgage Loans accrue interest at three-month LIBOR plus 1.325% with principal and interest payable on a quarterly basis. At December 31, 2019, the outstanding balance of the Mortgage Loans was approximately $38 million and we are in compliance with the financial covenant of the Mortgage Loans.\nAs of the most recent goodwill impairment test performed on October 1, 2019, we elected to perform a qualitative goodwill impairment test for our Specialty P&C, Workers' Compensation Insurance and Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance reporting units. Each of these reporting units have historically had an excess of fair value over book value and based on current operations are expected to continue to do so; therefore, our annual impairment test for these reporting units was performed qualitatively. In applying the qualitative approach, management considered macroeconomic factors, industry and market conditions, cost factors that could have a negative impact on the reporting units, actual financial performance of the reporting units versus expectations and management's future business expectations. As a result of the qualitative assessments, management concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of our three reporting units that have goodwill was less than the carrying value of each reporting unit as of the testing date; therefore, no further impairment testing was required. No goodwill impairment was recorded in 2019, 2018 or 2017.\n\n (3) Our other healthcare providers are primarily dentists, chiropractors and allied health professionals. The increase in 2019 is primarily due to the timing of the prior year renewal of one policy as well as new business written. \nThe increase in DPAC amortization for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily reflected the increase in net premiums earned. The increase in other underwriting and operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 reflected an increase in compensation and benefit related costs, technology costs, including an increase in the allocation of technology costs charged by our Corporate segment, professional fees and bad debt expense.\nThe increase in operating cash flows in 2018 as compared to 2017 of $3.9 million was primarily due to an increase in premium receipts of $60.8 million, a decrease in 2018 estimated tax payments as compared to 2017 of $11.5 million and a decrease in cash paid for operating expenses of $1.6 million, partially offset by an increase in paid losses of $64.3 million and a decrease in cash received from investment income of $5.1 million. The increase in premium receipts was driven by our Specialty P&C segment, primarily due to premiums received from a loss portfolio transfer entered into during the second quarter of 2018 and, to a lesser extent, our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment, primarily due to premiums received related to the third quarter 2017 acquisition of the Great Falls book of business. The decrease in 2018 estimated tax payments was primarily due to the lower statutory federal income tax rate in 2018 as compared to 2017. The increase in paid losses was driven by all of our operating segments, particularly in our Specialty P&C segment, primarily due to the timing of loss payments between periods, and our Lloyd's Syndicates segment, primarily due to 2017 storm-related losses which were paid in 2018. The decrease in cash paid for operating expenses was primarily due to a decrease in compensation related costs, largely offset by an increase in cash paid for operating expenses in our Lloyd's Syndicates segment primarily due to the start-up of Syndicate 6131. The decrease in cash received from investment income was primarily due to a reduction in interest received on our fixed maturities portfolio resulting from lower average balances.\nCash flows between periods compare as follows:\nThe following table summarizes calendar year net loss ratios by separating losses between the current accident year and all prior accident years. Additionally, the table shows our current accident year net loss ratios were affected by revisions to our estimate of premiums owed to reinsurers related to coverages provided in prior accident years. The net loss ratios for our Specialty P&C segment were as follows:\nThere were no business combinations during the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nNew business, audit premium, retention and renewal price changes for the assumed workers' compensation premium is shown in the table below:\nIntangibles\n \u2022 Beginning in 2017, we identified potential higher severity trends in the broader HCPL industry. These trends were also reflected in increases in estimates of ultimate losses for open HCPL claims for earlier accident years, which resulted in a lower amount of favorable development recognized in 2018 and 2017 as compared to prior years. \n (4) Our legal professionals policies are primarily individual and small group policies in select areas of practice. Our legal professionals premium remained relatively unchanged in 2019 as compared to 2018 as new business written and renewal pricing increases were offset by retention losses. The increase in renewal pricing was primarily the result of an increase in the rate charged for certain renewed policies in select states due to rate filings. \nOur expense ratio for the Specialty P&C segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 was as follows:\nCeded Premiums Ratio\nWe record the majority of our investments at fair value as shown in the table below. At December 31, 2019, the distribution of our investments based on GAAP fair value hierarchies (levels) was as follows:\n \u2022 The net loss ratio which is calculated as net losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned and is a component of underwriting profitability. \nNew business opportunities, renewal pricing and retention continue to be a challenge as a result of intense competition, especially from multi-line carriers that are willing to underprice their workers' compensation products to offset other coverages. This has resulted in fewer new business opportunities, which is reflected in a 20% decline in submissions during 2019. The decrease in new business in 2019 as compared to 2018 also reflects the acquisition of the Great Falls renewal book of business in September 2017, which contributed $11.7 million of new business for the year ended December 31, 2018. Excluding the Great Falls acquisition, submissions declined 12% during 2019. Renewal pricing decreases reflect the competitive market, as well as the impact of state loss cost decreases in the majority of the states in which we write business.\nNew business, audit premium, retention and renewal price changes for both the traditional business and the alternative market business are shown in the table below:\nOther underwriting and operating expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily driven by $4.9 million of fees incurred in 2019 as compared to $1.0 million in 2018 associated with a data analytics services agreement entered into during the fourth quarter of 2018, partially offset by a decrease in compensation related costs primarily due to lower bonuses. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the data analytics services agreement.\nManagement fees are charged pursuant to a management agreement by the Corporate segment to the operating subsidiaries within our Specialty P&C segment for services provided based on the extent to which services are provided to the subsidiary and the amount of premium written by the subsidiary. While the terms of the management agreement were consistent between 2019 and 2018, fluctuations in the amount of premium written by each subsidiary can result in corresponding variations in the management fee charged to each subsidiary during a particular period.\nWithin our Lloyd's Syndicates segment, Syndicate 1729 utilizes reinsurance to provide capacity to write larger limits of liability on individual risks, to provide protection against catastrophic loss and to provide protection against losses in excess of policy limits. The level of reinsurance that Syndicate 1729 purchases is dependent on a number of factors, including its underwriting risk appetite for catastrophic exposure, the specific risks inherent in each line or class of business written and the pricing, coverage and terms and conditions available from the reinsurance market. Reinsurance protection by line of business is as follows:\nOur consolidated and segment underwriting expense ratios were as follows:\nEach dividend was paid in the month following the quarter in which it was declared. Cash dividends totaling $93 million, $316 million and $315 million were paid during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Any decision to pay future cash dividends is subject to the Board's final determination after a comprehensive review of financial performance, future expectations and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.\nCalendar year incurred losses ceded to our external reinsurers increased $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. Current accident year ceded incurred losses increased $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. The increase in current accident year ceded incurred losses primarily reflected the impact of four claims totaling $11.2 million, of which $8.3 million related to two claims, incurred in 2019.\nExpenses\nGross, ceded and net premiums written were as follows:\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. All of our fixed maturity and equity investments are carried at fair value. The fair value of our short-term securities approximates the cost of the securities due to their short-term nature.\nThe decrease in our consolidated net investment result in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily attributable to a decrease in earnings (loss) from our unconsolidated subsidiaries, somewhat offset by an increase in net investment income. Equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated subsidiaries includes our share of the operating results of interests we hold in certain LPs/LLCs as well as operating losses associated with our tax credit partnership investments, which are designed to generate returns in the form of tax credits and tax-deductible project operating losses. During 2019, the earnings generated from our LPs/LLCs did not exceed the operating losses recorded from our tax credit partnership investments resulting in an overall loss from investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries as compared to earnings from investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2018. The decrease in earnings generated from our LPs/LLCs in 2019 was driven by lower reported earnings from two LP investments, somewhat offset by lower operating losses from our tax credit partnership investments. The increase in net investment income in 2019 was primarily due to an increase in interest earned on our FAL in our Lloyd's Syndicate segment due to a higher average balance in 2019 as compared to 2018. Our FAL primarily includes investment-grade corporate debt securities deposited with Lloyd's.\n \u2022 Workers' Compensation Insurance - This segment includes our workers' compensation insurance business which is provided primarily to employers with 1,000 or fewer employees. Our workers' compensation products include guaranteed cost policies, policyholder dividend policies, retrospectively-rated policies, deductible policies and alternative market solutions. Alternative market program premiums are 100% ceded to either SPCs in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment or, to a limited extent, an unaffiliated captive insurer. \nWe have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements/guarantees that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. See more information on our off-balance sheet arrangements in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nReinsurance\nThe change in renewal pricing for our Specialty P&C segment, including by major component, was as follows:\n\nThe following table is a reconciliation of net income to Non-GAAP operating income (loss):\n (2) During 2019 and 2018, we increased the premiums owed under reinsurance agreements for prior accident years which decreased net premiums earned (the denominator of the current accident year ratio). See the discussion in the Premiums section for our Specialty P&C segment under the heading \"Ceded Premiums Written\" for additional information. \nThe anticipated payout of losses and loss adjustment expenses is based upon our historical payout patterns. Both the timing and amount of these payments may vary from the payments indicated.\nOther Reinsurance Arrangements\n \u2022 The operating ratio which is the combined ratio, less the investment income ratio. This ratio provides the combined effect of underwriting profitability and investment income. \nNet premiums earned consist of gross premiums earned less the portion of earned premiums that we cede to SPCs in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment, external reinsurers or to any unaffiliated captive insurers. Because premiums are generally earned pro rata over the entire policy period, fluctuations in premiums earned tend to lag those of premiums written. Our workers' compensation policies are twelve month term policies, and premiums are earned on a pro rata basis over the policy period. Net premiums earned also include premium adjustments related to the audit of our insureds' payrolls. Payroll audits are conducted subsequent to the end of the policy period and any related adjustments are recorded as fully earned in the current period. In addition, we record an estimate for EBUB and evaluate the estimate on a quarterly basis. We did not adjust the EBUB estimate during the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018. The increase in net premiums earned primarily reflected the pro rata effect of higher net premiums written during the preceding twelve months, partially offset by the retrospective policy premium adjustments, as previously discussed.\nLitigation\n\nUnderwriting Expense Ratio (the Expense Ratio)\nNet premiums earned consist of gross premiums earned less the portion of earned premiums that the SPCs cede to external reinsurers. Because premiums are generally earned pro rata over the entire policy period, fluctuations in premiums earned tend to lag those of premiums written. Policies ceded to the SPCs are twelve month term policies and premiums are earned on a pro rata basis over the policy period. Net premiums earned also include premium adjustments related to the audit of workers' compensation insureds' payrolls. Payroll audits are conducted subsequent to the end of the policy period and any related adjustments are recorded as fully earned in the current period. The increase in net premiums earned primarily reflected the pro rata effect of higher net premiums written during the preceding twelve months.\nInvestment fund LPs/LLCs are by nature less liquid and may involve more risk than other investments. We manage our risk through diversification of asset class and geographic location. At December 31, 2019, we had investments in 37 separate investment funds with a total carrying value of $310.3 million which represented approximately 9% of our total investments. We review and monitor the performance of these investments on a quarterly basis.\nProfessional Liability\nGross, ceded and net premiums written were as follows:\nOur Lloyd's Syndicates segment includes operating results from our participation in certain Syndicates at Lloyd's of London. In addition to our participation in Syndicate operating results, we have investments in and other obligations to our Lloyd's Syndicates consisting of a Syndicate Credit Agreement and FAL requirements. For the 2019 underwriting year, our FAL was comprised of investment securities and cash and\nDPAC amortization primarily represented ceding commissions, which vary by program and are paid to our Workers' Compensation Insurance and Specialty P&C segments for premiums assumed. Ceding commissions include an amount for fronting fees, commissions, premium taxes and risk management fees, which are reported as an offset to underwriting, policy acquisition and operating expenses within our Workers' Compensation Insurance and Specialty P&C segments. In addition, ceding commissions paid to our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment include cell rental fees which are recorded as other income within our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment.\nWe generally reinsure risks under treaties (our excess of loss reinsurance agreements) pursuant to which the reinsurers agree to assume all or a portion of all risks that we insure above our individual risk retention levels, up to the maximum individual limits offered. These agreements are negotiated and renewed annually. Renewal dates for our healthcare professional liability, medical technology liability and workers' compensation treaties are October 1, January 1 and May 1, respectively. Our healthcare professional liability treaty renewed October 1, 2019 at a higher rate than the previous agreement, partially offset by a lower intermediary compensation rate. Our medical technology liability treaty renewed January 1, 2020 at a lower rate than the previous agreement. Our workers' compensation treaty renewed May 1, 2019 at a lower rate than the previous agreement; however, the lower rate reflects the addition of an AAD and the elimination of the return premium component of the contract. The significant coverages provided by our current excess of loss reinsurance agreements are detailed in the following table.\n\n\nLarge healthcare professional liability risks that are above the limits of our basic reinsurance treaties are reinsured on a facultative basis, whereby the reinsurer agrees to insure a particular risk up to a designated limit. We also have in place a number of risk sharing arrangements that apply to the first $1 million of losses for certain large healthcare systems and other insurance entities, as well as with certain insurance agencies that produce business for us.\nVariability of Loss Reserves\nOur Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment underwriting, policy acquisition and operating expenses were comprised as follows:\nWe evaluate our operating lease ROU assets for impairment at the asset group level whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of an asset group, which includes the operating lease ROU asset and the related operating lease liability, is not recoverable if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group over the life of the primary asset in the asset group. That assessment is based on the carrying amount of the asset group, including the operating lease ROU asset and the related operating lease liability, at the date it is tested for recoverability and an impairment loss is measured and recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. Any impairment loss is allocated to each asset in the asset group, including the operating ROU asset.\nClaims in our workers' compensation line of business have historically closed at a faster rate than in our HCPL or medical technology liability lines of business. This faster disposition rate, along with a lower net retention after the application of reinsurance, has resulted in less volatility in loss estimates on a net basis. However, a change in the number of individually-severe claims can create volatility in a given accident year. The following table presents additional information about the loss development for our workers' compensation line of business:\ncomponent of the reserve for losses on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. For the year ended December 31, 2019, a nominal amount of DPAC was charged to expense as it was determined to be unrecoverable, and a $9.2 million PDR was established in our Specialty P&C segment related to a large national healthcare account. See further discussion on the PDR in the Segment Operating Results - Specialty Property & Casualty section that follows. No amounts were determined to be unrecoverable for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWe use insurance and reinsurance (collectively, reinsurance\u201d) to provide capacity to write larger limits of liability, to provide reimbursement for losses incurred under the higher limit coverages we offer, to provide protection against losses in excess of policy limits and, in the case of risk sharing arrangements, to align our objectives with those of our strategic business partners and to provide custom insurance solutions for large customer groups. The purchase of reinsurance does not relieve us from the ultimate risk on our policies; however, it does provide reimbursement for certain losses we pay.\nCeded premiums written were as follows:\nSee table notes on following page.\nCeded Premiums Ratio\nreinsurers during the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily reflected an increase in earned premium, partially offset by the impact of lower reinsurance rates for the treaty year effective May 1, 2019.\n \u2022 Book value per share which is calculated as total shareholders' equity at the balance sheet date divided by the total number of common shares outstanding. This ratio measures the net worth of the company to shareholders on a per-share basis. The declaration of dividends decreases book value per share. Growth in book value per share, adjusted for dividends declared, is an indicator of overall profitability.  We particularly focus on our combined ratio and investment returns, both of which directly affect our ROE and growth in our book value. We currently target a dynamic long-term ROE of 700 basis points above the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate, which at December 31, 2019 was approximately 8.9%.\nLevel 3 Investments\n\n(2) The 21% rate is the statutory rate associated with the taxable or tax deductible items listed above. See previous discussion in this section under the heading \"Taxes.\"\n \u2022 recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date.  For structured securities (primarily asset-backed securities), management estimates the present value of the security's cash flows using the effective yield of the security at the date of acquisition (or the most recent implied rate used to accrete the security if the implied rate has changed as a result of a previous impairment or changes in expected cash flows). We consider the most recently available six month averages of the levels of delinquencies, defaults, severities and prepayments for the collateral (loans) underlying the securitization or, if historical data is not available, sector based assumptions to estimate expected future cash flows of these securities.\nManagement considers the following accounting estimates to be critical because they involve significant judgment by management and those judgments could result in a material effect on our financial statements.\nAs a result of our re-evaluation of previously established reserves, we recognized net unfavorable prior year reserve development of $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to net favorable prior year reserve development of $77.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Development recognized during 2019 principally related to accident years 2016 through 2018. Development recognized during 2018 principally related to accident years 2011 through 2014. Net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2019 included $51.5 million of unfavorable prior year reserve development related to our reserves for the previously mentioned large national healthcare account that has experienced losses far exceeding the assumptions we made when underwriting the account, beginning in 2016. Excluding the unfavorable development related to this account, the Specialty P&C segment recognized favorable prior year reserve development totaling $45.8 million in 2019 which included favorable loss development in our medical technology liability line of business of $12.8 million. Net favorable loss development in 2018 of $77.0 million included $13.3 million and $10.9 million attributable to our medical technology liability and legal professional liability lines of business, respectively. While the majority of our reserves continue to develop favorably, the favorable development we recognized, excluding the large national healthcare account, was lower as compared to 2018 due to the observed increase in claim severity in the broader HCPL industry.\nFor the Specialty P&C, Workers' Compensation Insurance and Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segments, the analysis performed by the consulting actuaries analyzes each partition of our business in a variety of ways and uses multiple actuarial methodologies in performing these analyses, including:\nThis can be seen in looking at both the absolute amount of reserve development recognized for the less developed accident years as well as the size of such development when compared to established ultimates for those same accident years at the end of the preceding calendar year. The following table provides this information for years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 with respect to the three then most recent prior accident years:\n (1) Net losses, as specified, divided by net premiums earned. \nLevel 1 Investments\nNet investment income for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was primarily attributable to interest earned on available-for-sale fixed maturity investments, which primarily includes investment-grade corporate debt securities. Net realized investment gains for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily reflected realized gains from the sale of equity securities. Net realized investment losses for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily reflected a decrease in the fair value of the equity securities portfolio.\nWe estimate our current accident year loss and loss adjustment expenses based on an expected loss ratio. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses for the current accident year are determined by applying the expected loss ratio to net premiums earned, which includes audit premium, for the respective period. The following table summarizes calendar year net loss ratios by separating losses between the current accident year and all prior accident years. Calendar year and current accident year net loss ratios by component were as follows:\nProAssurance Corporation is a holding company and is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. As a holding company, our principal source of external revenue is our investment revenues. In addition, dividends from our operating subsidiaries represent a significant source of funds for our obligations, including debt service and shareholder dividends. We also charge our operating subsidiaries within our Specialty P&C and Workers' Compensation Insurance segments a management fee based on the extent to which services are provided to the subsidiary and the amount of gross premium written by the subsidiary. At December 31, 2019, we held cash and liquid investments of approximately $280 million outside our insurance subsidiaries that were available for use without regulatory approval or other restriction, of which $17 million was used to pay shareholder dividends in January 2020. We also have $250 million in permitted borrowings under our Revolving Credit Agreement and an accordion feature available which, if subscribed successfully, would allow another $50 million in available funds as discussed in this section under the heading \"Debt.\" As of February 14, 2020, no borrowings were outstanding under our Revolving Credit Agreement.\nLosses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nUse of Judgment\n\n \u2022 The line entitled Reserve for losses, undiscounted and net of reinsurance recoverables\u201d reflects our reserve for losses and loss adjustment expense, less the receivables from reinsurers, each as reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the end of each year (the Balance Sheet Reserves). \nNet Premiums Earned\nAudit Premium\nNet favorable reserve development recognized within our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment primarily reflected better than expected claim trends in the 2015 through 2018 accident years. The improved claim trends reflected lower frequency and severity than anticipated at the time the reserves were established.\n\n (9) This component of gross premiums written includes all other product lines within our Specialty P&C segment. The increase during 2019 was due to a $1.5 million specialty contractual liability policy.  We are committed to a rate structure that will allow us to fulfill our obligations to our insureds, while generating competitive long-term returns for our shareholders. Our pricing continues to be based on expected losses as indicated by our historical loss data and available industry loss data. In recent years, this practice has resulted in gradual rate increases and we anticipate further rate increases due to indications of increasing loss severity. Additionally, the pricing of our business includes the effects of filed rates, surcharges and discounts. Renewal pricing also reflects changes in our exposure base, deductibles, self-insurance retention limits and other policy items.\n\nWe manage our investing cash flows to ensure that we will have sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations, taking into consideration the timing of cash flows from our investments, including interest payments, dividends and principal payments, as well as the expected cash flows to be generated by our operations as discussed in this section under the heading \"Investing Activities and Related Cash Flows.\"\nCeded premiums written were as follows:\nAs a result of actuarial analyses performed by both internal and consulting actuaries during 2019 and 2018, we increased our current accident year net loss ratio in our Specialty P&C segment in both 2019 and 2018; however, the adjustment was greater in 2019 as compared to 2018 which accounted for 3.4 percentage points of the increase in our consolidated current accident year net loss ratio. This increase in 2019 was driven by increased reserve estimates for a large national healthcare account and, to a lesser extent, in our broader HCPL excess and surplus lines of business. In addition, the higher consolidated current accident year net loss ratio reflected changes to our reserve in our Specialty P&C segment related to DDR coverage endorsements as well as a PDR of $9.2 million, which accounted for 1.7 and 1.1 percentage points, respectively, of the increase. The PDR represents an estimated premium deficiency associated with the aforementioned large national healthcare account which is reflected as a component of current accident year net losses in 2019 (see further discussion in our Segment Operating Results - Specialty Property & Casualty section that follows). Furthermore, the increase in our consolidated current accident year net loss ratio also reflected a $10 million reserve that an SPC at Eastern Re established during 2019 associated with an assumed E&O liability policy in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment which accounted for 1.2 percentage points of the increase. We do not participate in the SPC that assumed this policy; therefore, these losses are the obligation of the external cell participants and are reflected in the SPC dividend expense (income), which is an offset to expenses, and thus has no effect on our consolidated net income or Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment net operating results for 2019 (see further discussion in our Segment Operating Results - Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance section that follows).\nWe recognized net favorable reserve development of $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, of which $10.1 million related to our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment and $7.8 million related to our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment, partially offset by net unfavorable reserve development of $5.7 million and $0.4 million related to our Specialty P&C and Lloyd's Syndicates segments, respectively.\n \u2022 The underwriting expense ratio which is calculated as underwriting, policy acquisition and operating expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned and is a component of underwriting profitability. \nThe determination of calendar year losses involves the actuarial evaluation of incurred losses for the current accident year and the actuarial re-evaluation of incurred losses for prior accident years, including an evaluation of the reserve amounts required for losses in excess of policy limits.\nGross premiums written for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were primarily comprised of workers' compensation coverages assumed from our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment. Workers' compensation gross premiums written decreased during 2019, primarily reflecting the competitive workers' compensation market. The increase in healthcare professional liability gross premiums written during 2019 was driven primarily by the addition of one large policy and the renewal of certain policies in 2019 that were written on a short-term basis in 2018. We retained 100% of the available alternative market programs up for renewal during 2019, including 22 workers' compensation programs and 3 healthcare professional liability programs. Additionally, we added one new alternative market program at Inova Re during the third quarter of 2019.\nFor non-structured fixed maturities (obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions and corporate debt) the estimate of expected cash flows is determined by projecting a recovery value and a recovery time frame and assessing whether further principal and interest will be received. We consider various factors in projecting recovery values and recovery time frames, including the following:\nWe make a determination of the amount of insurance risk we choose to retain based upon numerous factors, including our risk tolerance and the capital we have to support it, the price and availability of reinsurance, the volume of business, our level of experience with a particular set of claims and our analysis of the potential underwriting results. We purchase excess of loss reinsurance to limit the amount of risk we retain and we do so from a number of companies to mitigate concentrations of credit risk. We utilize reinsurance brokers to assist us in the placement of these reinsurance programs and in the analysis of the credit quality of our reinsurers. The determination of which reinsurers we choose to do business with is based upon an evaluation of their then current financial strength, rating, stability and claims payment practices.\nCertain of the methodologies utilized to estimate the ultimate losses for each partition of our reserves consider the actual amounts paid. Paid data is particularly influential when a large portion of known claims have been closed, as is the case for older accident years. In selecting a point estimate for each partition, management considers the extent to which trends are emerging consistently for all partitions and known industry trends. Thus, actual, rather than estimated severity trends are given more consideration. If actual severity trends are lower than those estimated at the time that reserves were previously established, the recognition of favorable development is indicated. This is particularly true for older accident years where our actuarial methodologies give more weight to actual loss costs (severity).\nIn both 2019 and 2018, our consolidated calendar year net loss ratio was lower than our consolidated current accident year net loss ratio due to the recognition of consolidated net favorable prior year reserve development, as shown in the previous table. Consolidated net favorable prior year reserve development in 2019 was lower than in 2018 driven by unfavorable development recognized in our Specialty P&C segment of $5.7 million in 2019 as compared to favorable development of $77.0 million recognized in 2018. The unfavorable development recognized in our Specialty P&C segment in 2019 was driven by $51.5 million of unfavorable prior year reserve development related to the previously mentioned large national healthcare account that has experienced losses far exceeding the assumptions we made when underwriting the account, beginning in 2016. Excluding the unfavorable development related to this account, our Specialty P&C segment recognized favorable prior year reserve development totaling $45.8 million in 2019.\nNet Premiums Earned\nWorkers' Compensation Insurance Segment. Many factors affect the ultimate losses incurred for our workers' compensation coverages (10% of our consolidated gross reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2019) including but not limited to the type and severity of the injury, the age, health and occupation of the injured worker, the estimated length of disability, medical treatment and related costs, and the jurisdiction and workers' compensation laws of the state of the injury occurrence. We use various actuarial methodologies in developing our workers' compensation reserve, combined with a review of the payroll exposure base. For the current accident year, given the lack of seasoned information, the different actuarial methodologies produce results with significant variability; therefore, more emphasis is placed on supplementing results from the actuarial methodologies with trends in exposure base, medical expense inflation, general inflation, severity, and claim counts, among other things, to select an expected loss ratio.\nSegment operating results reflects our share of the underwriting and investment results of the SPCs in which we participate, and included the following:\nCeded premiums represent the amounts owed to our reinsurers for their assumption of a portion of our losses. Through our current excess of loss reinsurance arrangements we generally retain the first $1 million in risk insured by us and cede coverages in excess of this amount. For our healthcare professional liability coverages, we also retain from 4% - 9% of the next $25 million of risk for coverages in excess of $1 million. For our medical technology liability coverages, we also retain 10% of the next $9 million of risk for coverages in excess of $1 million. We pay our reinsurers a ceding premium in exchange for their accepting the risk, and in certain of our excess of loss arrangements, the ultimate amount of which is determined by the loss experience of the business ceded, subject to certain minimum and maximum amounts.\n\nAt December 31, 2019, 99% of our investments in available-for-sale fixed maturity securities were rated, and the average rating was A+. The distribution of our investments in available-for-sale fixed maturity securities by rating were as follows:\nThe above table reflects ceded premiums as a percent of gross premiums written for the workers' compensation business only; healthcare professional liability business is assumed net of reinsurance, as discussed above. The ceded premiums ratio reflects the weighted average reinsurance rates of all SPC programs. The ceded premiums ratio remained unchanged for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements/Guarantees\nWe did not repurchase any common shares subsequent to December 31, 2019 and as of February 14, 2020 our remaining Board authorization was approximately $110 million.\n \u2022 A general decline in claim frequency has also been a contributor to favorable loss development. A significant portion of our policies through 2003 were issued on an occurrence basis, and a smaller portion of our ongoing business results from the issuance of extended reporting endorsements which have occurrence-like exposure. As claim frequency declined, the number of reported claims related to these coverages was less than originally expected. \n\n\n\n\nWe operate in five segments which are based on our internal management reporting structure for which financial results are regularly evaluated by our CODM to determine resource allocation and assess operating performance. Descriptions of ProAssurance's five operating and reportable segments are as follows:\n \u2022 if the entire amortized basis of the security is not expected to be recovered.  The assessment of whether the amortized cost basis of a security, particularly an asset-backed debt security, is expected to be recovered requires management to make assumptions regarding various matters affecting future cash flows. The choice of assumptions is subjective and requires the use of judgment. Actual credit losses experienced in future periods may differ from management's estimates of those credit losses. Methodologies used to estimate the present value of expected cash flows are:\n\n \u2022 our ability and intent to hold the investment until the recovery of its carrying value; and \nOur medical technology liability line of business has not experienced the change in claim frequency previously described for HCPL. However, the nature of the risks insured and volatility of the loss experience in this line of business has produced more variable loss development, as presented in the following table:\nGoodwill\nUnderwriting Expense Ratio (the Expense Ratio)\n \u2022 Reserves for 2013 include gross and net reserves acquired in 2013 business combinations of $201.1 million and $126.0 million, respectively. \nCeded premiums written were as follows:\nFor significant property catastrophe exposures, Syndicate 1729 uses third-party catastrophe models to accumulate a listing of potentially affected policies. Each identified policy is given an estimate of loss severity based upon a combination of factors including the probable maximum loss of each policy, market share analytics, underwriting judgment, client/broker estimates and historical loss trends for similar events. These models are inherently uncertain, reliant upon key assumptions and management judgment and are not always a representation of actual events and ensuing potential loss exposure. Determination of actual losses may take an extended period of time until claims are reported and resolved, including coverage litigation.\nAccident year refers to the accounting period in which the insured event becomes a liability of the insurer. For claims-made policies, which represent the majority of the premiums written in our Specialty P&C segment, the insured event generally becomes a liability when the event is first reported to us. For occurrence policies, the insured event becomes a liability when the event takes place. For retroactive coverages, the insured event becomes a liability at inception of the underlying contract. We believe that measuring losses on an accident year basis is the best measure of the underlying profitability of the premiums earned in that period, since it associates policy premiums earned with the estimate of the losses incurred related to those policy premiums.\n\nBook value per share is calculated as total shareholders' equity at the balance sheet date divided by the total number of common shares outstanding. This ratio measures the net worth of the Company to shareholders' on a per share basis. Our book value per share at December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018 is shown in the following table.\nCeded premiums ratio was as follows:\n \u2022 internal assessments and the assessments of external portfolio managers regarding specific circumstances surrounding an investment, which indicate the investment is more or less likely to recover its amortized cost than other investments with a similar structure; \n\n\nNon-GAAP operating income (loss) is a financial measure that is widely used to evaluate performance within the insurance sector. In calculating Non-GAAP operating income (loss), we have excluded the after-tax effects of the items listed in the following table that do not reflect normal operating results. We believe Non-GAAP operating income (loss) presents a useful view of the performance of our insurance operations, however it should be considered in conjunction with net income computed in accordance with GAAP.\nWe partition our reserves by accident year, which is the year in which the claim becomes our liability. For claims-made policies, the insured event generally becomes a liability when the event is first reported to us. For occurrence policies, the insured event becomes a liability when the event takes place. For retroactive coverages, the insured event becomes a liability at inception of the underlying contract. As claims are incurred (reported) and claim payments are made, they are aggregated by accident year for analysis purposes. We also partition our reserves by reserve type: case reserves and IBNR reserves. Case reserves are established by our claims departments based upon the particular circumstances of each reported claim and represent our estimate of the future loss costs (often referred to as expected losses) that will be paid on reported claims. Case reserves are decremented as claim payments are made and are periodically adjusted upward or downward as estimates regarding the amount of future losses are revised; reported loss for an individual claim is the case reserve at any point in time plus the claim payments that have been made to date. IBNR reserves represent our estimate in the aggregate of future development on losses that have been reported to us and our estimate of losses that have been incurred but not reported to us.\nAnnual Goodwill Impairment Test\nGenerally, methods such as the Bornhuetter-Ferguson Method are used on more recent accident years where we have less data on which to base our analysis. As time progresses and we have an increased amount of data for a given accident year, we begin to give more confidence to the development and average methods, as these methods typically rely more heavily on our own historical data. These methods emphasize different aspects of loss reserve estimation and provide a variety of perspectives for our decisions.\nConsiderable judgment is required in establishing our initial reserve for any current accident year period, as there is limited data available upon which to base our estimate (see further discussion that follows under the heading \"Uses of Judgment\"). Our process for setting an initial reserve considers the unique characteristics of each product, but in general we rely heavily on the loss assumptions that were used to price business, as our pricing reflects our analysis of loss costs that we expect to incur relative to the insurance product being priced.\nCurrent Accident Year - Initial Reserve\nCeded Premiums Written\nWorkers' compensation premiums are determined based upon the payroll of the insured, respective premium rates and, where applicable, an experience-based modification factor. An audit of the policyholders' records is conducted after policy expiration to make a final determination of applicable premiums. Audit premium due from or due to a policyholder as a result of an audit is reflected in net premiums written and earned when billed. We track, by policy, the amount of additional premium billed in final audit invoices as a percentage of payroll exposure and use this information to estimate the probable additional amount of EBUB premium as of the balance sheet date. We include changes to the EBUB premium estimate in net premiums written and earned in the period recognized.\nWe offer alternative market solutions whereby we cede certain premiums from our Workers' Compensation Insurance and Specialty P&C segments to either the SPCs at Inova Re or Eastern Re, our Cayman Islands reinsurance subsidiaries which are reported in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment, or, to a limited extent, an unaffiliated captive insurer. During 2019 and 2018, we wrote total alternative market premium of approximately $90.0 million and $90.2 million, respectively. The majority of these policies ($86.7 million and $85.1 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively) are reinsured to the SPCs at Inova Re or Eastern Re, net of a ceding commission. Each SPC at Inova Re and Eastern Re is owned, fully or in part, by an agency, group or association, and the operating results of the SPCs are due to the participants of that cell. We participate to a varying\nContractual Obligations\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act\nGross Premiums Written\nNet unfavorable development recognized within our Lloyd's Syndicates segment was driven by higher than expected losses and development on certain large claims which resulted in unfavorable development with respect to a previous year of account. See further discussion in our Segment Operating Results - Lloyd's Syndicates section that follows.\nImpairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level, which is consistent with our reportable segments identified in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Of the five reporting units, three have goodwill - Specialty P&C, Workers' Compensation Insurance and Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually on October 1, upon the occurrence of certain triggering events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate the fair value of goodwill may be impaired and immediately before and after a reorganization that affects the composition of one or more of our reporting units, if applicable.\nMedical Technology Liability\nSegment Operating Results - Specialty Property & Casualty\nGiven the uncertainty inherent in our estimates of losses and related amounts recoverable from reinsurers, these estimates may vary significantly from the ultimate outcome.\nIntangible assets with definite lives are amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset. Amortizable intangible assets primarily consist of agency and policyholder relationships, renewal rights and trade names. Intangible assets with an indefinite life, primarily state licenses, are not amortized. Intangible assets are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or upon the occurrence of certain triggering events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate the fair value of the asset may be impaired. Additional information regarding our intangible assets is included in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNew business written by major component on a direct basis was as follows:\nThe increase in the expense ratio for the year ended December 31, 2019, exclusive of the items noted in the table, primarily reflected the increase in other underwriting and operating expenses noted above.\n(1) Historically, retention has ranged from 5% to 32.5%.\nMost fixed income securities do not trade daily; thus, exchange-traded prices are generally not available for these securities. However, market information (often referred to as observable inputs or market data, including but not limited to, last reported trade, non-binding broker quotes, bids, benchmark yield curves, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, offers and recent data regarding assumed prepayment speeds, cash flow and loan performance data) is available for most of our fixed income securities. We determine fair value for a large portion of our fixed income securities using available market information. In accordance with GAAP, we classify securities valued based on multiple market observable inputs as Level 2 securities.\nExcess of Loss Reinsurance Agreements\nDebt\nFair Values Not Categorized\nOur investment portfolio continues to be primarily composed of high quality fixed income securities with approximately 94% of our fixed maturities being investment grade securities as determined by national rating agencies. The weighted average effective duration of our fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2019 was 2.96 years; the weighted average effective duration of our fixed maturity securities combined with our short-term securities was 2.58 years.\n \u2022 Corporate - This segment includes our investment operations, other than those reported in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance and Lloyd's Syndicates segments, interest expense and U.S. income taxes. This segment also includes non-premium revenues generated outside of our insurance entities and corporate expenses.  Additional information regarding our segments is included in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Part I and in the Segment Operating Results sections that follow.\n\nGross, ceded and net premiums earned were as follows:\nthe nature and intensity of a loss event. For significant reinsured catastrophe losses, the inability or unwillingness of the reinsurer to make timely payments under the terms of the reinsurance agreement could have an adverse effect on Syndicate 1729's liquidity.\nThe Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment reflects the operating results (underwriting profit or loss, plus investment results, net of U.S. federal income taxes) of SPCs at Inova Re and Eastern Re, our Cayman Islands SPC operations, as discussed in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. SPCs are segregated pools of assets and liabilities that provide an insurance facility for a defined set of risks. Assets of each SPC are solely for the benefit of that individual cell and each SPC is solely responsible for the liabilities of that individual cell. Assets of one SPC are statutorily protected from the creditors of the others. Each SPC is owned, fully or in part, by an agency, group or association and the operating results of the SPCs are attributable to the participants of that cell. We participate to a varying degree in the results of selected SPCs and, for the SPCs in which we participate, our participation interest ranges from a low of 20% to a high of 85%. SPC operating results attributable to external cell participants are reflected as an SPC dividend expense in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment. In addition, our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment includes the SPC investment results as the investments are solely for the benefit of the cell participants, and investment results attributable to external cell participants are reflected in the SPC dividend expense. As of December 31, 2019, there were 27 (23 active) SPCs. The SPCs assume workers' compensation insurance, healthcare professional liability insurance or a combination of the two from our Workers' Compensation Insurance and Specialty P&C segments. As of December 31, 2019, there were two SPCs that assumed both workers' compensation insurance and healthcare professional liability insurance and one SPC that assumed only healthcare professional liability insurance. In addition, an SPC at Eastern Re assumed an errors and omissions liability policy from a captive insurer unaffiliated with ProAssurance during 2019.\nBecause of the implicit and wide-ranging nature of severity trend assumptions on the loss reserving process, it is not practical to specifically isolate the impact of changing severity trends. However, because severity is an explicit component of our HCPL pricing process we can better isolate the impact that changing severity can have on our loss costs and loss ratios in regards to our pricing models for this business component. Our current HCPL pricing models assume severity trends in the range of 2% to 5% depending on state, territory and specialty. In some portions of our HCPL business we have observed and reflected higher severity trends in our estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses.\nTable Notes\nWe use various actuarial methods in the process of setting reserves. Each actuarial method generally returns a different value, and for the more recent accident years the variations among the various methodologies can be significant. For each partition of our reserves, we evaluate the results of the various methods, along with the supplementary statistical data regarding such factors as closed with and without indemnity ratios, claim severity trends, the expected duration of such trends, changes in the legal and legislative environment and the current economic environment to develop a point estimate based upon management's judgment and past experience. The series of selected point estimates is then combined to produce an overall point estimate for ultimate losses.\nWe did not have any change in accounting estimate or policy that had a material effect on our results of operations or financial position during 2019. We are not aware of any accounting changes not yet adopted as of December 31, 2019 that would have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional detail regarding accounting changes not yet adopted.\n\nFair values for a majority of our equity securities and portions of our corporate debt, short-term and convertible securities are determined using exchange-traded prices. There is little judgment involved when fair value is determined using an exchange-traded price. In accordance with GAAP, we classify securities valued using an exchange-traded price as Level 1 securities.\nThe following table presents additional information about the loss development for our professional liability line of business:\nChanges in the return premium estimate reflected the loss experience under the reinsurance treaties during 2019 and 2018. The increase in the return premium estimate for the year ended December 31, 2019 reflected prior year unfavorable loss development on reinsured claims.\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, we adopted ASU 2016-02, which requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions in applying the requirements of this new guidance. We are involved in a number of leases, primarily for office facilities. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at the inception date of the contract and classify all leases as either financing or operating. As of December 31, 2019, all of our leases were classified as operating. Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized as of the lease commencement date based on the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted over the term of the lease using a discount rate determined based on information available as of the commencement date. The ROU asset represents the right to use the underlying asset (office space) for the lease term. As the majority of our lessors do not provide an implicit discount rate, we use our collateralized incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of remaining lease payments. For leases entered into or reassessed after the adoption of ASU 2016-02, we account for lease and non-lease components of a contract as a single lease component.\n \u2022 Reported (Incurred) Development Method \nWhen a pricing service does not provide a value for one of our fixed maturity securities, management estimates fair value using either a single non-binding broker quote or pricing models that utilize market based assumptions which have limited observable inputs. The process involves significant judgment in selecting the appropriate data and modeling techniques to use in the valuation process. In accordance with GAAP, we classify securities valued using limited observable inputs as Level 3 securities.\nAverage Paid Value and Average Reported Value Methods. In these methods, average claim cost data (paid claim cost for the Average Paid Value Method and reported claim cost for the Reported Value Method) is developed to an ultimate average cost level by report year based on historical data. Claim counts are similarly developed to an ultimate count level. The average claim cost (after rounding and adjustment, if necessary, to accommodate report year data that is not considered to be predictive) is then multiplied by the ultimate claim counts by report year to derive ultimate loss and ALAE.\n \u2022 any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency; and \nIf the severity trend were to be higher by 1 percentage point, the impact would be an increase in our initial expected loss ratio for this business of 3.2 percentage points, based on current claim disposition patterns. An increase in the severity trend of 3 percentage points would result in a 10.1 percentage point increase in our initial expected loss ratio. Due to the long-tailed nature of our claims and the previously discussed historical volatility of loss costs, selection of a severity trend assumption is a\nSegment Operating Results - Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance\n\n\nWe measure the fair value of certain assets on a nonrecurring basis when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. These assets include investments carried principally at cost, investments in tax credit partnerships, fixed assets, goodwill and other intangible assets. These assets would also include any equity method investments that do not provide a NAV.\nFor our Specialty P&C segment, we calculate retention as annualized renewed premium divided by all annualized premium subject to renewal. Retention is affected by a number of factors. We may lose insureds to competitors or to alternative insurance mechanisms such as risk retention groups or self-insurance entities (often when physicians join hospitals or large group practices) or due to pricing or other issues. We may choose not to renew an insured as a result of our underwriting evaluation. Insureds may also terminate coverage because they have left the practice of medicine for various reasons, principally for retirement, death or disability, but also for personal reasons.\nOur Board declared cash dividends during 2019, 2018 and 2017 as follows:\nExclusive of securities where there is an intent to sell or where it is not more likely than not that the security will be required to be sold before recovery of its amortized cost basis, OTTI for debt securities is separated into a credit component and a non-credit component. The credit component of an OTTI is the difference between the security's amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows, while the non-credit component is the remaining difference between the security's fair value and the present value of expected future cash flows. The credit component of the OTTI is recognized in earnings while the non-credit component is recognized in OCI.\nWithin our Specialty P&C segment, we use insurance and reinsurance (collectively, reinsurance\u201d) to provide capacity to write larger limits of liability, to provide reimbursement for losses incurred under the higher limit coverages we offer and to provide protection against losses in excess of policy limits. Within our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment, we use reinsurance to reduce our net liability on individual risks, to mitigate the effect of significant loss occurrences (including catastrophic events), to stabilize underwriting results and to increase underwriting capacity by decreasing leverage. In both our Specialty P&C and Workers' Compensation Insurance segments, we use reinsurance in risk sharing arrangements to align our objectives with those of our strategic business partners and to provide custom insurance solutions for large customer groups. The purchase of reinsurance does not relieve us from the ultimate risk on our policies; however, it does provide reimbursement for certain losses we pay. We pay our reinsurers a premium in exchange for reinsurance of the risk. In certain of our excess of loss arrangements, the premium due to the reinsurer is determined by the loss experience of the business reinsured, subject to certain minimum and maximum amounts. Until all loss amounts are known, we estimate the premium due to the reinsurer. Changes to the estimate of premium owed under reinsurance agreements related to prior periods are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs and can have a significant effect on net premiums earned.\nTreasury Shares\nIf the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment of goodwill, if any. In the second step, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\n \u2022 Bornhuetter-Ferguson (Paid and Reported) Method \n \u2022 During 2019 the loss experience in our HCPL excess and surplus lines of business deteriorated further, particularly in regard to the reserves we established for a large national healthcare account that has experienced losses far exceeding the assumptions we made when underwriting the account, beginning in 2016. As a result, we strengthened our HCPL reserves through the recognition of net unfavorable development on prior accident years and a higher current accident year net loss ratio in our Specialty P&C segment in 2019 as discussed more fully in our Segment Operating Results - Specialty Property and Casualty section that follows. \nDuring 2019, our operating subsidiaries paid dividends to us of approximately $123 million, including extraordinary dividends from our insurance subsidiaries of approximately $20 million. Our insurance subsidiaries, in the aggregate, are permitted to pay dividends of approximately $88 million over the course of 2020 without prior approval of state insurance regulators. However, the payment of any dividend requires prior notice to the insurance regulator in the state of domicile, and the regulator may reduce or prevent the dividend if, in its judgment, payment of the dividend would have an adverse effect on the surplus of the insurance subsidiary. We make the decision to pay dividends from an insurance subsidiary based on the capital needs of that subsidiary and may pay less than the permitted dividend or may also request permission to pay an additional amount (an extraordinary dividend).\nDuring 2019, we recognized OTTI in earnings of $0.8 million and non-credit OTTI in OCI of $0.2 million, both of which related to three corporate bonds in the energy and consumer sectors. We recognized OTTI in earnings of $0.5 million during 2018 related to debt instruments from two issuers in the energy sector. Other net realized investment gains during 2019 was driven by changes in the fair value of our equity trading portfolio. See further discussion in our Segment Operating Results - Corporate section that follows.\nNet premiums earned were as follows:\nChanges in our premium volume within our Specialty P&C segment are driven by four primary factors: (1) the amount of new business, (2) our retention of existing business, (3) the premium charged for business that is renewed, which is affected by rates charged and by the amount and type of coverage an insured chooses to purchase and (4) the timing of premium written through multi-period policies. In addition, premium volume may periodically be affected by shifts in the timing of renewals between periods. The healthcare professional liability market, which accounts for a majority of the revenues in this segment, remains challenging as physicians continue joining hospitals or larger group practices and are thus no longer purchasing individual or group policies in the standard market. In addition, some competitors have chosen to compete primarily on price; both factors may impact our ability to write new business and retain existing business. Furthermore, the insurance and reinsurance markets have historically been cyclical, characterized by extended periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity as well as periods when shortages of capacity permitted more favorable premium levels. Changes in the frequency and severity of losses may affect the cycles of the insurance and reinsurance markets significantly. During soft markets, it could be very difficult for us to grow or maintain premium volume levels without sacrificing underwriting profits. Conversely, during hard markets, rising prices may pressure retention levels.\nThe various actuarial methods discussed above are applied in a consistent manner from period to period. In addition, we perform statistical reviews of claims data such as claim counts, average settlement costs and severity trends when establishing our reserves.\nLeases\nIn 2019, we recognized $10.1 million of net favorable development in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment and $7.8 million of net favorable development in our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment. In 2018, we recognized $9.0 million of net favorable development in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment and $8.0 million of net favorable development in our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment. In 2017, we recognized $8.5 million of net favorable development in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment and $5.7 million of net favorable development in our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment. In each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, net favorable development in our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment included $1.6 million related to the amortization of the purchase accounting fair value adjustment. As previously discussed, this fair value adjustment has been fully amortized as of December 31, 2019.\n \u2022 The section entitled Re-estimated net liability as of\u201d reflects the re-estimated amount of the liability previously recorded as Balance Sheet Reserves that includes the cumulative amounts paid and an estimate of the remaining net liability based upon claims experience as of the end of each succeeding year (the Net Re-estimated Liability). \n \u2022 for asset-backed securities, the origination date of the underlying loans, the remaining average life, the probability that credit performance of the underlying loans will deteriorate in the future and our assessment of the quality of the collateral underlying the loan; \nOver the long-term we expect our growth to come primarily through controlled expansion of our existing operations. In addition, from time to time, we may identify opportunities for growth through the acquisition of other insurers, service providers or books of business. Growth through acquisition is often opportunistic and cannot be predicted.\nWe recognize OTTI, exclusive of non-credit OTTI, in earnings as a part of net realized investment gains (losses). In subsequent periods, any measurement of gain, loss or impairment is based on the revised amortized basis of the security. Non-credit OTTI on debt securities and declines in fair value of available-for-sale securities not considered to be other-than-temporary are recognized in OCI.\n\nGross Premiums Written\n (8) Certain components of our gross premiums written include alternative market premiums in our captive cell program. We cede either all or a portion of the alternative market premium, net of reinsurance, to certain SPCs of our wholly owned Cayman Islands reinsurance subsidiaries, Inova Re and Eastern Re, which are reported in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment (see further discussion in the Ceded Premiums Written section that follows). The portion not ceded to the SPCs is retained within our Specialty P&C segment. Total gross premiums written by component in our alternative market captive cell program were as follows: \n \u2022 Reinsurance is utilized on a per risk basis for the property insurance and casualty coverages in order to mitigate risk volatility. \ndegree in the results of selected SPCs and, for the SPCs in which we participate, our participation interest ranges from a low of 20% to a high of 85%. SPC operating results due to external cell participants are reflected as an SPC dividend expense (income) in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment. See further discussion on our SPC operations in the Segment Operating Results - Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance section that follows. The alternative market workers' compensation policies are ceded from our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment to the SPCs under 100% quota share reinsurance agreements. The alternative market professional liability policies are ceded from our Specialty P&C segment to the SPCs under either excess of loss or quota share reinsurance agreements, depending on the structure of the individual program. The nominal portion of the risk that is not ceded to an SPC is retained in our Specialty P&C segment and may also be reinsured under our standard healthcare professional liability reinsurance program, depending on the policy limits provided. The remaining premium written in our alternative market business of $2.4 million and $4.5 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, was 100% ceded to a single unaffiliated captive insurer in 2019 and to two unaffiliated captive insurers in 2018.\nSegment Operating Results - Lloyd's Syndicates\nWe hold interests in certain investment funds, primarily LPs/LLCs, which measure fund assets at fair value on a recurring basis and provide us with a NAV for our interest. As a practical expedient, we consider the NAV provided to approximate the fair value of the interest. In accordance with GAAP, we do not categorize these investments within the fair value hierarchy.\nOperating Ratio\n\nGross premiums written in our traditional business decreased during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, which reflected our response to underpricing that is occurring in a very competitive market. New business written, renewal pricing and the retention rate all declined during 2019. The decrease in deductible premiums written primarily reflects\nWe utilize an interest rate cap agreement with a notional amount of $35 million to manage our exposure to increases in LIBOR on our Mortgage Loans. Per the interest rate cap agreement, we are entitled to receive cash payments if and when the three-month LIBOR exceeds 2.35%. Additional information on our interest rate cap agreement is provided in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nA detailed listing of our investment holdings as of December 31, 2019 is located under the Financial Information heading on the Investor Relations page of our website which can be reached directly at www.proassurance.com/investmentholdings, or through links from the Investor Relations section of our website, investor.proassurance.com.\nWorkers' Compensation. The projection of changes in claim severity trend has not historically been an influential factor affecting our analysis of workers' compensation reserves, as claims are typically resolved more quickly than the industry norm. As previously mentioned, the determination and calculation of loss development factors, in particular, the selection of tail factors which are used to extend the projection of losses beyond historical data, requires considerable judgment.\nResults of Operations - Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\n\nThe decrease in premiums ceded to unaffiliated captive insurers during the year ended December 31, 2019 reflected the impact of a novation of an unaffiliated captive program into an SPC at Inova Re during the fourth quarter of 2018. The premium ceded to this program is now reflected in premiums ceded to SPCs in the table above. For the year ended December 31, 2018, premiums related to this program that were ceded to the unaffiliated captive totaled $1.8 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, premiums ceded to unaffiliated captive insurers in the table above reflected business ceded to one unaffiliated captive program.\nOverview\n\nFor our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment and for the workers' compensation exposures in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment, we utilize the Reported (Incurred) Development Method, Paid Development Method and Bornhuetter-Ferguson Method, to develop our reserve for each accident year. The actuarial review includes the stratification of claims data (lost time claims, medical only claims) using different variations that allow us to identify trends that may not be readily identifiable if the data was evaluated only in the aggregate. Reported and paid loss development factors are key assumptions in the reserve estimation process and are based on our historical reported and paid loss development patterns. As accident years mature, the various actuarial methodologies produce more consistent loss estimates.\nThe 2019 current accident year net loss ratio reflects the impact of the AAD (see previous discussion under the heading \"Ceded Premiums Written\") and renewal rate decreases, largely offset by overall favorable trends in claim closing patterns during 2019.\nLloyd's Syndicates Segment. Initial reserves for Syndicate 1729 and Syndicate 6131 are primarily recorded using the loss assumptions by risk category incorporated into each Syndicate's business plan submitted to Lloyd's with consideration given to loss experience incurred to date (4% of our consolidated gross reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2019). The assumptions used in each business plan are consistent with loss results reflected in Lloyd's historical data for similar risks. The loss ratios may also fluctuate due to the timing of earned premium adjustments. Such adjustments may be the result of premiums for certain policies and assumed reinsurance contracts being reported subsequent to the coverage period and may be subject to adjustment based on loss experience. Premium and exposure for some of Syndicate 1729's insurance policies and reinsurance contracts are initially estimated and subsequently recorded over an extended period of time as reports are received under delegated underwriting authority programs. When reports are received, the premium, exposure and corresponding loss estimates are revised accordingly. Changes in loss estimates due to premium or exposure fluctuations are incurred in the accident year in which the premium is earned.\nAt December 31, 2019, our FAL was comprised of fixed maturity securities with a fair value of $129.9 million and cash and cash equivalents of $7.2 million deposited with Lloyd's. See further discussion in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe following table shows our consolidated and segment net loss ratios and net loss development:\n\n\nWe are committed to disciplined underwriting, pricing and loss reserving practices as well as conservative investment practices, even during difficult market conditions. We are also committed to maintaining prudent operating and financial leverage. We recognize the importance that our customers and producers place on the financial strength of our insurance subsidiaries, and we manage our business to protect our financial security.\n \u2022 The line entitled Net cumulative redundancy (deficiency)\u201d reflects the difference between the previously recorded Balance Sheet Reserve for each applicable year and the Net Re-estimated Liability relating thereto as of the end of the most recent fiscal year. \n \u2022 External excess of loss reinsurance is utilized by Syndicate 1729 to manage the net loss exposure on the specialty property and contingency coverages ceded to Syndicate 6131 (see further discussion in Segment Operating Results - Lloyd's Syndicates section that follows).  Syndicate 1729 may still be exposed to losses that exceed the level of reinsurance purchased as well as to reinstatement premiums triggered by losses exceeding specified levels. Cash demands on Syndicate 1729 can vary significantly depending on\n\n \u2022 The tax ratio which is calculated as total income tax expense (benefit) divided by income (loss) before income taxes and measures our effective tax rate. \nThe TCJA also requires a U.S. shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation to include its GILTI in U.S. taxable income. The GILTI amount is based on the U.S. shareholder's aggregate share of the gross income of the controlled foreign corporation reduced by certain exceptions and a net deemed tangible income return. The net deemed tangible income return is based on the controlled foreign corporation's basis in the tangible depreciable business property. Cell rental fee income earned by Inova Re and Eastern Re fall within the scope of the GILTI provisions of the TCJA. We have evaluated the new GILTI provisions of the TCJA and we have made an accounting policy election to treat the taxes due on inclusions of GILTI in U.S. taxable income as a current period expense when incurred. We recognized a nominal amount of tax expense for the GILTI provision of the TCJA during year ended December 31, 2019.\n\nAs part of our evaluation of the recoverability of DPAC, we also evaluate our unearned premiums for premium deficiencies. A premium deficiency is recognized if the sum of anticipated losses and loss adjustment expenses, unamortized DPAC and maintenance costs, net of anticipated investment income, exceeds the related unearned premium. If a premium deficiency is identified, the associated DPAC is written off, and a PDR is recorded for the excess deficiency as a component of net losses and loss adjustment expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income and as a\nThe Adjusted Reported and the Adjusted Paid Methods. These methods are based on the premise that the relative change in a given accident year's adjusted reported loss estimates (Adjusted Reported Method) or adjusted paid losses (Adjusted Paid Method) from one evaluation point to the next is similar to changes observed for earlier accident years at the same evaluation points. In the Adjusted Reported Method reported loss estimates are adjusted to reflect a common case reserve adequacy basis. In the Adjusted Paid Method, the historical paid loss experience is adjusted to reflect a common claim settlement rate basis. We principally use these methods to evaluate reserves for our legal liability coverages.\n \u2022 Average Paid Value Method \nWe evaluate our available-for-sale investment securities on at least a quarterly basis for the purpose of determining whether declines in fair value below recorded cost basis represent OTTI. We consider an OTTI to have occurred:\nThe following table summarizes the calendar year net loss ratios by separating losses between the current accident year and all prior accident years. The current accident year net loss ratio reflected the aggregate loss ratio for all programs. Loss reserves are estimated for each program on a quarterly basis. Due to the size of some of the programs, quarterly loss results can create volatility in the current accident year net loss ratio to fluctuate significantly from period to period.\n\nAsset-backed debt securities that have been impaired due to credit reasons or are below investment grade quality are accounted for under the effective yield method. Under the effective yield method, estimates of cash flows expected over the life of asset-backed securities are used to recognize income on the investment balance for subsequent accounting periods.\nThe majority of premiums in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment are assumed from either our Workers' Compensation Insurance or Specialty P&C segments. Premium volume is driven by five primary factors: (1) the amount of new business written, (2) retention of the existing book of business, (3) premium rates charged on the renewal book of business and, for workers' compensation business, (4) changes in payroll exposure and (5) audit premium.\nAs shown in the table below, our ceded premiums ratio was affected in both 2019 and 2018 by revisions to our estimate of premiums owed to reinsurers related to coverages provided in prior accident years.\n\nOur Workers' Compensation Insurance segment underwriting, policy acquisition and operating expenses were comprised as follows:\n (5) Given the length of time that it takes to resolve our claims, many years may elapse before all losses recoverable under a reinsurance arrangement are known. As a part of the process of estimating our loss reserve we also make estimates regarding the amounts recoverable under our reinsurance arrangements. As previously discussed, the premiums ultimately ceded under certain of our excess of loss reinsurance arrangements are subject to the losses ceded under the arrangements. As part of the review of our reserves during 2019 and 2018, we increased our estimate of expected losses and associated recoveries for prior year ceded losses, as well as our estimate of ceded premiums owed to reinsurers; however, this increase was lower in 2019 as compared to 2018 due to reaching the maximum level of premium due under certain prior year excess of loss arrangements. Changes to estimates of premiums ceded related to prior accident years are fully earned in the period the changes in estimates occur. \nHCPL. Over the past several years the most influential factor affecting the analysis of our HCPL reserves and the related development recognized has been an observed increase in claim severity for the broader HCPL industry as well as higher initial loss expectations on incurred claims. The severity trend is an explicit component of our pricing models, whereas in our reserving process the severity trend's impact is implicit. Our estimate of this trend and our expectations about changes in this trend impact a variety of factors, from the selection of expected loss ratios to the ultimate point estimates established by management.\nOur Workers' Compensation Insurance segment includes workers' compensation products provided to employers generally with 1,000 or fewer employees, as discussed in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Workers' compensation products offered include guaranteed cost policies, policyholder dividend policies, retrospectively-rated policies, deductible policies and alternative market solutions. Alternative market products include program design, fronting, claims administration, risk management, SPC rental, asset management and SPC management services. Alternative market program premiums are 100% ceded to either the SPCs within our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment or, to a limited extent, an unaffiliated captive insurer. Our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment operating results reflected pre-tax underwriting profit or loss from these workers' compensation products, exclusive of investment results, which are included in our Corporate segment. Segment operating results included the following:\nUnderwriting, policy acquisition and operating expenses in both 2019 and 2018 included a provision for U.S. federal income taxes of $1.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively, for SPCs at Inova Re that have elected to be taxed as U.S. tax payers. The increase in the federal income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 reflects an increase in taxable income for the Inova Re SPCs. This provision for federal income taxes is included in the total SPC net operating results and the portion of federal income taxes attributable to external cell participants is reflected in the SPC dividend (expense) income. We have removed the impact of the provision for U.S. federal income taxes from the expense ratio as these expenses do not represent underwriting expenses of the SPCs.\nOur emphasis on rate adequacy, selective underwriting, effective claims management and prudent investments is a key factor in our ability to achieve our long-term ROE target. We closely monitor premium revenues, losses and loss adjustment expenses, and underwriting and policy acquisition expenses. Our overall investment strategy is to focus on maximizing current income from our investment portfolio while maintaining safety, liquidity, duration and portfolio diversification. While we engage in activities that generate other income, these activities, such as insurance agency services, do not constitute a significant use of our resources or a significant source of revenues or profits.\n \u2022 Property umbrella excess of loss reinsurance is utilized for peak catastrophe and frequency of catastrophe exposures. \nOur Workers' Compensation Insurance segment cedes alternative market business under a 100% quota share reinsurance agreement, net of a ceding commission, to SPCs in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment.\nSegregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance Segment. The factors that affect the ultimate losses incurred for the workers' compensation and healthcare professional liability coverages assumed by the SPCs at Inova Re and Eastern Re (4% of our consolidated gross reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2019) are consistent with that of our Workers' Compensation Insurance and Specialty P&C segments, respectively.\n\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nThe carrying value and unfunded commitments for certain of our investments were as follows:\nNet unfavorable reserve development of $5.7 million in our Specialty P&C segment was driven by $51.5 million of unfavorable reserve development recognized in 2019 related to our reserves for the previously mentioned large national healthcare account that has experienced losses far exceeding the assumptions we made when underwriting the account, beginning in 2016. Excluding the unfavorable reserve development related to this account, the Specialty P&C segment recognized favorable reserve development totaling $45.8 million in 2019 which included favorable reserve development in our medical technology liability line of business of $12.8 million. Net favorable reserve development in 2018 of $77.0 million included $13.3 million and $10.9 million attributable to our medical technology liability and legal professional liability lines of business, respectively. While the majority of our reserves in our Specialty P&C segment continue to develop favorably, the favorable development we recognized, excluding the large national healthcare account, was lower as compared to 2018, in part due to the observed increase in claim severity in the broader HCPL industry. See further discussion in our Segment Operating Results - Specialty Property & Casualty section that follows under the heading \"Losses.\"\nThe slight increase in the current accident year ceded premiums ratio for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to the effect of the 2018 loss portfolio transfer (increase in gross premiums written with no premium ceded) which decreased the 2018 current accident year ceded premiums ratio by approximately 0.7 percentage points. Excluding the impact of the 2018 loss portfolio transfer, the current accident year ceded premiums ratio decreased by approximately 0.4 percentage points in 2019 as compared to 2018 driven by the effect of the non-renewal of the quota share reinsurance agreement with Syndicate 1729 and a decrease in premium ceded under our excess of loss reinsurance arrangements, partially offset by an increase in premium ceded to the SPCs in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment.\nROE is calculated as net income divided by the average of beginning and ending shareholders' equity. This ratio measures our overall after-tax profitability and shows how efficiently capital is being used. ROE for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was as follows:\nThe underwriting expense ratio included the impact of the following:\n (1) Physician policies were our greatest source of premium revenues in both 2019 and 2018. The increase in twelve month term policies in 2019 included timing differences of $5.6 million primarily related to the prior year renewal of certain policies. Excluding the effect of these timing differences, twelve month term policies increased $9.2 million as compared to 2018. The remaining increase was primarily due to new business written, an increase in exposure related to three policies written on an excess and surplus lines basis totaling $5.2 million and an increase in renewal pricing, partially offset by retention losses. Renewal pricing increases in 2019 are reflective of our concern about increases in loss severity. The lower retention for 2019 is largely attributable to our focus on underwriting discipline, as we continue to emphasize careful risk selection, rate adequacy and a willingness to walk away from business that does not fit our goal of achieving a long-term underwriting profit. We anticipate a lower than average level of retention to persist as we continue to reevaluate certain books of business and set our rates to reflect our observations of higher severity trends. We also offer twenty-four month term policies to our physician insureds in one selected jurisdiction. The increase in twenty-four month term policies in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily reflected the normal cycle of renewals (policies subject to renewal in 2019 were previously written in 2017 rather than in 2018). \nFor our Lloyd's Syndicates segment we rely on the analysis of actual loss experience on the book of business written by Syndicate 1729 to determine loss development by accident year.\nCash Flows\nProAssurance Corporation is a holding company for property and casualty insurance companies. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiaries provide professional liability insurance for healthcare professionals and facilities, professional liability insurance for attorneys and their firms, liability insurance for medical technology and life sciences risks and workers' compensation insurance. We also provide capital to Syndicate 1729 and are the sole (100%) capital provider for Syndicate 6131 at Lloyd's of London.\nPaid Development and Reported (Incurred) Development Methods. These methods use historical, cumulative losses (paid losses for the Paid Development Method, reported losses for the Reported (Incurred) Development Method) by accident year and develop those actual losses to estimated ultimate losses based upon the assumption that each accident year will develop to estimated ultimate cost in a manner that is analogous to prior years, adjusted as deemed appropriate for the expected effects of known changes in the claim payment environment (and case reserving environment for the Reported (Incurred) Development Method); and to the extent necessary, supplemented by analyses of the development of broader industry data.\nWe believe our emphasis on the fair treatment of our insureds and other important stakeholders through our commitment to Treated Fairly\u201d has enhanced our market position and differentiated us from other insurers. We will continue to practice our values of integrity, leadership, relationships and enthusiasm in all of our activities. We will honor these values in the execution of Treated Fairly\u201d to perform our Mission and realize our Vision. We believe that as we reach more customers with this message we will continue to improve retention and add new insureds.\nOur reserving process can be broadly grouped into three areas: the establishment of the reserve for the current accident year (the initial reserve), the re-estimation of the reserve for prior accident years (development of prior accident years) and the establishment of the initial reserve for risks assumed in business combinations, applicable only in periods in which acquisitions occur (the acquired reserve). A summary of the activity in our net reserve for losses during 2019 and 2018 is provided under the heading \"Losses\" in the Liquidity and Capital Resources and Financial Condition section that follows.\nAny change in our estimate of net ultimate losses for prior years is reflected in net income in the period in which such changes are made.\nThe following may be helpful in understanding the Analysis of Reserve Development:\nOur workers' compensation premium volume is driven by five primary factors: (1) the amount of new business written, (2) retention of our existing book of business, (3) premium rates charged on our renewal book of business, (4) changes in payroll exposure and (5) audit premium.\nAs previously discussed, alternative market premiums written through our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment's alternative market business unit are 100% ceded, less a ceding commission, to either the SPCs in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment or, to a limited extent, an unaffiliated captive insurer. The ceding commission consists of an amount for fronting fees, cell rental fees, commissions, premium taxes and risk management fees. The fronting fees, commissions, premium taxes and risk management fees are recorded as an offset to underwriting, policy acquisition and operating expenses. Cell rental fees are recorded as a component of other income and claims administration fees are recorded as ceded ULAE. The increase in SPC ceding commissions earned in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily reflected the increase in alternative market earned premium.\n \u2022 Reserves for 2010 and thereafter include gross and net reserves acquired in 2010 business combinations of $88.1 million and $82.2 million, respectively. \n (2) Our healthcare facilities premium (which includes hospitals, surgery centers, long-term care facilities and other miscellaneous healthcare facilities) decreased in 2019 as compared to 2018 due to retention losses, partially offset by new business written and, to a lesser extent, an increase in renewal pricing. Retention losses in 2019 were driven by our decision not to renew certain products written on an excess and surplus lines basis after our underwriting evaluation and, to a lesser extent, the loss of two large policies totaling $1.7 million due to price competition as a result of rate increases. As we continue to reevaluate certain books of business, we anticipate our retention to remain at a lower than historic level. Renewal pricing increases in 2019 reflect rate increases where we believe appropriate given the loss environment and loss indications we are seeing in the healthcare facilities space. \nSelected consolidated financial data for each period is summarized in the table below.\n \u2022 failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments; \nThroughout the discussion we use certain terms and abbreviations, which can be found in the Glossary of Terms and Acronyms at the beginning of this report. In addition, a glossary of insurance terms and phrases is available on the investor section of our website. Throughout the discussion, references to \"ProAssurance,\" \"PRA,\" \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us\" and \"our\" refer to ProAssurance Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. The discussion contains certain forward-looking information that involves significant risks, assumptions and uncertainties. As discussed under the heading \"Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\" our actual financial condition and operating results could differ significantly from these forward-looking statements.\nUnderwriting, Policy Acquisition and Operating Expenses\nOur investments at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 are comprised as follows:\n(2) Historically, retention has been as high as $2M.\nWe update and review the data underlying the estimation of our current accident year reserve each reporting period and make adjustments to current accident year net loss ratios that we believe best reflect emerging data. Both our internal and consulting actuaries perform an in-depth review of our current accident year reserve on at least a semi-annual basis. As a result of these analyses in both 2019 and 2018, we increased our current accident year net loss ratio; however, the adjustment was greater in 2019 as compared to 2018 which accounted for 6.0 percentage points of the increase in the current accident year net loss ratio. This increase in 2019 was driven by increased reserve estimates for a large national healthcare account and, to a lesser extent, in our broader HCPL excess and surplus lines of business.\nLevel 2 Investments\nGross premiums written by component were as follows:\nReserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nWe operate in very competitive markets and face strong competition from other insurance companies for all of our insurance products. HCPL insurance represents the largest product line in our gross premiums written (53% in 2019) and the healthcare market has been trending toward the formation of larger medical practice groups and the employment of physicians by hospitals. Large medical groups and facilities frequently manage their healthcare professional liability exposure outside of the traditional first dollar insurance marketplace using self-insured mechanisms and other risk sharing arrangements. In response to these trends, we offer products designed to provide greater risk sharing options to hospitals and large physician groups. Since the middle of 2019, new senior leadership in our Specialty P&C segment has executed a comprehensive underwriting strategy in response to emerging loss trends and changing conditions in the HCPL industry. This includes organizational structure enhancements, recruitment of additional talent in specialty underwriting, price strengthening and tightening of underwriting criteria, terms and conditions. Furthermore, the new senior leadership team for our Specialty P&C segment executed several strategic business decisions intended to improve operating performance by bringing together all of the Specialty P&C segment lines of business and operations under a unified organizational and management structure.\nOur funding commitments are primarily related to non-public investment entities but also include the unused commitment under our Syndicate Credit Agreement as we presume it will be fully advanced within the next year for purposes of the disclosure in the table above. The above table excludes a short-term loan commitment where we have agreed to advance funds on a 30 day basis. For more information regarding these agreements see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nBornhuetter-Ferguson Method. We use both the Paid and the Reported Bornhuetter-Ferguson Methods. The Paid Method assigns partial weight to initial expected losses for each accident year (initial expected losses being the first established case and IBNR reserves for a specific accident year) and partial weight to paid to date losses. The Reported Method assigns partial weight to the initial expected losses and partial weight to current expected losses. The weights assigned to the initial expected losses decrease as the accident year matures.\nWe recognized an income tax benefit in both 2019 and 2018; however, the comparability of our effective tax rates is impacted by the pre-tax loss recognized in 2019 as compared to pre-tax income recognized in 2018.\nWe are involved in a number of operating leases primarily for office facilities. Office facility leases have remaining lease terms ranging from one year to thirteen years. The above table includes the remaining future minimum lease payments including imputed interest for operating leases that had an initial or remaining non-cancellable lease term in excess of one year as of December 31, 2019. In addition, the above table excludes total future minimum lease payments of $1.5 million for an eleven year lease signed but not yet commenced as of December 31, 2019. Additional information regarding our leases is included in Note 1 and Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe following table shows our consolidated and segment net premiums earned:\nOur professional liability line of business includes both our HCPL and legal professional lines, with our HCPL line representing the largest component of our reserve. In support of our concern that the decline in frequency will result in a higher severity trend for our HCPL claims, we saw our closed-with-indemnity-payment ratio (i.e., the number of claims closed with an indemnity or loss payment as compared to the total number of closed claims) for our claims increase from 10% in 2005 to 18% in 2019.\nIn evaluating our performance, we consider a number of performance measures, including the following:\nWe believe that our operating cash flow and funds from our investment portfolio are adequate to meet our contractual obligations.\nGross Premiums Written\nLiquidity and Capital Resources and Financial Condition\ngrowth of Syndicate 6131 as well as an increase in fees associated with a data analytics services agreement entered into during the fourth quarter of 2018 in our Specialty P&C segment. In addition, the decrease in operating cash flows reflected a decrease in net cash received of $3.0 million associated with the cash settlement from the commutation of the 2017 and 2016 calendar year quota share reinsurance arrangements between our Specialty P&C segment and Syndicate 1729 due to the reduction in premiums ceded to Syndicate 1729. The decrease in operating cash flows was partially offset by an increase in net premium receipts of $19.0 million and a decrease in estimated tax payments of $3.0 million. The increase in net premium receipts was primarily due to the growth in written premium in our Lloyd's Syndicates and Specialty P&C segments.\n(1) The attachment point is based on a percentage of written premium within individual cells (average is 89%) and varies by cell.\nDPAC amortization increased during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 driven by an increase in earned premium, excluding the effects of the premium earned from the loss portfolio transfers in 2019 and 2018 as there were no deferred acquisition costs associated with those transactions (see discussion under the heading \"Gross Premiums Written\"). In addition, the increase in DPAC amortization also reflected a decrease in ceding commission income related to the reduction in premiums ceded to Syndicate 1729, partially offset by an increase in ceding commission income from certain of our shared risk arrangements.\nOther-than-temporary Impairments\n \u2022 Both quota share reinsurance and excess of loss reinsurance are utilized to manage the net loss exposure on our property reinsurance coverages. \nLloyd's Premium Estimates\n\n\nShareholder Dividends\nSpecialty P&C Segment. Loss costs within this segment are impacted by many factors including but not limited to the nature of the claim, including whether or not the claim is an individual or a mass tort claim, the personal situation of the claimant or the claimant's family, the outcome of jury trials, the legislative and judicial climate where any potential litigation may occur, general economic and social trends and, for claims involving bodily injury, the trend of healthcare costs. Within our Specialty P&C segment, for our HCPL business (76% of our consolidated gross reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2019), we set an initial reserve based upon our evaluation of the current loss environment including frequency, severity, economic inflation, social inflation and legal trends. The initial loss ratio for our HCPL business has ranged from 87% to 106% in recent years. We have recently trended towards the higher end of this range due to increased reserve estimates for a large national healthcare account that far exceeded the assumptions we made when originally underwriting the account as well as increases in loss severity in the broader HCPL industry, including our excess and surplus lines of business. See further discussion on our current accident year net loss ratio in our Segment Operating Results - Specialty Property & Casualty section that follows under the heading \"Losses.\"A similar practice is followed for our legal professional liability business (3% of our consolidated gross reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2019).\nNonrecurring Fair Value Measurements\nLoss Development\nAdditional information regarding our leases is included in Note 1 and Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe above table reflects ceded premiums earned as a percent of gross premiums earned. As discussed above, we cede premiums related to our traditional business to external reinsurers on an earned premium basis. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the ceded premiums ratio, excluding the effects in the table above, decreased slightly as compared to 2018 which primarily reflected the impact of lower reinsurance rates for the treaty year effective May 1, 2019.\nInvestment Valuations", "item_7_text": "Policy acquisition costs (primarily commissions, premium taxes and underwriting salaries) which are directly related to the successful acquisition of new and renewal premiums are capitalized as DPAC and charged to expense, net of ceding commissions earned, as the related premium revenue is recognized. We evaluate the recoverability of our DPAC typically at the segment level each reporting period or in a manner that is consistent with the way we manage our business. Any amounts estimated to be unrecoverable are charged to expense in the current period.\nThe TCJA introduced a minimum tax on payments made to related foreign entities referred to as the BEAT. The BEAT is imposed by adding back into the U.S. tax base any base erosion payment made by the U.S. taxpayer to a related foreign entity and applying a minimum tax rate to this newly calculated modified taxable income. Base erosion payments represent any amount paid or accrued by the U.S. taxpayer to a related foreign entity for which a deduction is allowed. Premiums we cede to the SPCs at Inova Re, one of our wholly owned Cayman Islands reinsurance subsidiaries, do not fall within the scope of base erosion payments as the SPCs at Inova Re intend to elect to be taxed as U.S. taxpayers. However, premiums that we cede to any active SPC at our other wholly owned Cayman Islands reinsurance subsidiary, Eastern Re, fall within the scope of base erosion payments and therefore could be significantly impacted by the BEAT. We have evaluated our exposure to the BEAT and have concluded that our expected outbound deductible payments to related foreign entities are below the threshold for application of the BEAT; therefore, we have not recognized any incremental tax expense for the BEAT provision of the TCJA for the year ended December 31, 2019. See further discussion on our Cayman Islands SPC operations in the Segment Operating Results - Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance section that follows.\nDue to the size of our consolidated reserve for losses and the large number of claims outstanding at any point in time, even a small percentage adjustment to our total reserve estimate could have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is made, as was the case in 2019, 2018 and 2017.\n\nRevenues\nThe acquisition of Eastern on January 1, 2014 increased our loss reserve by $153.2 million which represented the fair value of Eastern's loss reserve at the time of the acquisition. The fair value of the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses and related reinsurance recoverables was based on an actuarial estimate of the expected future net cash flows, a reduction of those cash flows for the time value of money determined utilizing the U.S. Treasury Yield Curve, and a risk adjustment to reflect the net present value of profit that an investor would demand in return for the assumption of the associated risks. Expected net cash flows were derived from the expected loss payment patterns included in an actuarial analysis of Eastern's reserve performed as of December 31, 2013. The fair value of the reserve, including the risk margin discussed above, exceeded the undiscounted loss reserve previously established by Eastern by $9.3 million; this fair value adjustment was amortized over the average expected life of the reserve of 6 years. The fair value adjustment has been fully amortized as of December 31, 2019.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment's net loss ratio was affected by a $10 million reserve that an SPC at Eastern Re established during the second quarter of 2019. This SPC previously assumed an errors and omissions policy that provides coverage for losses up to a lifetime maximum of $10 million from a captive insurer unaffiliated with ProAssurance. During the second quarter of 2019, a claim was filed under this policy that met the lifetime maximum limit and, accordingly, a $10 million reserve was recorded. We do not participate in the SPC that assumed this policy; therefore, these losses are the obligation of the external cell participants and are reflected as an offset in the SPC dividend expense (income) and have no effect on our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment net operating results for the year ended December 31, 2019. Given the significance of this one-time event, we have removed the impact of the policy from each of the ratios below (as shown in the columns labeled \"Adjusted\") in order to assist in the comparability between periods. Calendar year and current accident year net loss ratios for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\n\nSegregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance\nWe manage our investments to ensure that we will have sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations, taking into consideration the timing of cash flows from our investments, including interest payments, dividends and principal payments, as well as the expected cash flows to be generated by our operations. In addition to the interest and dividends we will receive, we anticipate that between $30 million and $80 million of our investments will mature (or be paid down) each quarter over the next twelve months and become available, if needed, to meet our cash flow requirements. The primary outflow of cash at our insurance subsidiaries is related to paid losses and operating costs, including income taxes. The payment of individual claims cannot be predicted with certainty; therefore, we rely upon the history of paid claims in estimating the timing of future claims payments. To the extent that we may have an unanticipated shortfall in cash, we may either liquidate securities or borrow funds under existing borrowing arrangements through our Revolving Credit Agreement and the FHLB system. As of February 14, 2020, $300 million could be made available for use through our Revolving Credit Agreement, as discussed in this section under the heading \"Debt.\" Given the duration of our investments, we do not foresee a shortfall that would require us to meet operating cash needs through additional borrowings. Additional information regarding our Revolving Credit Agreement is detailed in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur financing cash flows are primarily composed of dividend payments and borrowings and repayments under our Revolving Credit Agreement. See further discussion of our financing activities in this section under \"Financing Activities and Related Cash Flows.\"\nThe decrease in ceded premiums earned during 2019 as compared to 2018 reflected the effect of adjustments made during 2019 and 2018 to ceded premiums owed under reinsurance agreements related to prior accident year losses. After removing the effect of prior accident year ceded premium adjustments from both years, ceded premiums earned decreased $3.8 million in 2019 as compared to 2018. The remaining decrease was driven by the non-renewal of the quota share reinsurance agreement with Syndicate 1729, partially offset by the pro rata effect of an increase in premiums ceded under our shared risk arrangements during the preceding twelve months, predominantly in our CAPAssurance program.\n\n\nDuring 2019 the loss experience in our HCPL excess and surplus lines of business deteriorated further, particularly in regard to the reserves we established for a large national healthcare account, as previously discussed. This deterioration is the primary driver of the unfavorable development we recognized in 2019 for accident years 2016-2018. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, reflection of higher severity trends in certain HCPL lines of business also resulted in increases of estimated ultimate losses for open claims for earlier accident years, which resulted in a lower amount of favorable development recognized in 2018 and 2017 as compared to earlier years.\nOur consolidated underwriting expense ratio increased for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 due to the effect of a loss portfolio transfer (net premiums earned with minimal associated operating expenses) entered into during\nThe primary drivers of the increase in our consolidated current accident year net loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 were as follows:\nDeferred federal income taxes arise from the recognition of temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities determined for financial reporting purposes and the basis determined for income tax purposes. Our temporary differences principally relate to our loss reserves, unearned and advanced premiums, DPAC, compensation related items, unrealized investment gains (losses) and basis differences on fixed assets, intangible assets and operating leases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such benefits are realized. We review our deferred tax assets quarterly for impairment. If we determine that it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management is required to make certain judgments and assumptions about our future operations based on historical experience and information as of the measurement period regarding reversal of existing temporary differences, carryback capacity, future taxable income (including its capital and operating characteristics) and tax planning strategies.\nThe risks insured in our medical technology liability business (3% of our consolidated gross reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2019) are more varied, and policies are individually priced based on the risk characteristics of the policy and the account. The insured risks range from startup operations to large multinational entities, and the larger entities often have significant deductibles or self-insured retentions. Reserves are established using our most recently developed actuarial estimates of losses expected to be incurred based on factors which include results from prior analysis of similar business, industry indications, observed trends and judgment. Claims in this line of business primarily involve bodily injury to individuals and are affected by factors similar to those of our HCPL line of business. For the medical technology liability business, we also establish an initial reserve using a loss ratio approach, including a provision in consideration of historical loss volatility that this line of business has exhibited.\nWorkers' Compensation\nExcess of Loss Reinsurance Agreements\nKey Performance Measures\n (7) Our medical technology liability business is marketed throughout the U.S.; coverage is typically offered on a primary basis, within specified limits, to manufacturers and distributors of medical technology and life sciences products including entities conducting human clinical trials. In addition to the previously listed factors that affect our premium volume, our medical technology liability premium is impacted by the sales volume of insureds. The increase in 2019 was primarily due to new business written and, to a lesser extent, an increase in renewal pricing, largely offset by retention losses. Renewal pricing increases primarily reflect increases in the sales volume and exposure of certain insureds. Retention losses in 2019 are primarily attributable to an increase in competition on terms and pricing. \nAlthough the future degree and impact of the ultimate severity trend remains uncertain due to the long-tailed nature of our business, we have given consideration to observed loss costs in setting our rates. For our HCPL business, this practice had generally resulted in rate reductions as claim frequency declined and remained at historically low levels. For example, on average, excluding our podiatry business acquired in 2009, we had gradually reduced the premium rates we charged on our standard physician renewal business (our largest HCPL line) by approximately 17% from the beginning of 2006 to December 31, 2016.\nWe evaluate each of our ceded reinsurance contracts at inception to confirm that there is sufficient risk transfer to allow the contract to be accounted for as reinsurance under current accounting guidance. At December 31, 2019, all ceded contracts were accounted for as risk transferring contracts.\n\nAccounting Changes\nExcluding the impacts of the loss portfolio transfers entered into during 2019 and 2018 (net premiums earned with minimal associated operating expenses), our underwriting expense ratio was relatively unchanged for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 as the increase in earned premium and the decrease in compensation related costs outpaced the increase in DPAC amortization and offset the effect of the fees incurred related to the data analytics services agreement, as previously discussed.\n (5) We offer extended reporting endorsement or \"tail\" coverage to insureds who discontinue their claims-made coverage with us, and we also periodically offer tail coverage through custom policies. Tail coverage premiums are generally 100% earned in the period written because the policies insure only incidents that occurred in prior periods and are not cancellable. The amount of tail coverage premium written can vary significantly from period to period. The decrease in tail premiums in 2019 was driven by $7.9 million of tail coverage provided in connection with a loss portfolio transfer entered into during the second quarter of 2018, partially offset by $1.8 million of tail coverage provided in connection with a loss portfolio transfer entered into during the third quarter of 2019. \nThe process of estimating reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. These variables can be affected by both views of internal and external events, such as changes in views of economic inflation, legal trends and legislative changes, as well as differentiating views of individuals involved in the reserve estimation process, among others. We continually refine our estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical loss experience develops and additional claims are reported and settled. Our objective is to consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the time.\nAs a result of actuarial analyses performed by both internal and consulting actuaries during 2019, we concluded that additional reserves were needed in our Specialty P&C segment. As such, we recorded $5.7 million of net unfavorable development on our prior accident year reserves and recorded a higher current accident year net loss ratio which resulted in a net loss ratio of 106.7% in 2019. Furthermore, net losses and loss adjustment expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 included a $9.2 million PDR which represents an estimated premium deficiency associated with the unearned premium related to a large national healthcare account. See further discussion that follows under the heading \"Losses.\"\n\n(3) Includes an AAD where retention is the greater of $3.9M or 2.1% of subject premium in annual losses otherwise recoverable in excess of the $500k retention per loss occurrence.\nWe have used this modeled statistical distribution to calculate an 80% and 60% confidence interval for the potential outcome of our consolidated net reserve for losses. The high and low end points of the distributions are as follows:\nAdditional information regarding our debt is provided in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur Specialty P&C segment underwriting, policy acquisition and operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were comprised as follows:\nNet Investment Income and Net Realized Investment Gains (Losses)\nLosses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\n \u2022 in situations where there was a previous OTTI for the investment, whether the expected cash flows from the investment at the time of the OTTI, primarily tax benefits, are less than its current carrying value.  Investments which are accounted for under the equity method are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment might not be recoverable. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, evidence of the inability to recover the carrying value of the investment, the inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying value of the investment or the current fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOperating Activities and Related Cash Flows\n\n\nAt December 31, 2019 our gross reserve for losses included case reserves of approximately $1.5 billion and IBNR reserves of approximately $0.9 billion. Our consolidated gross reserve for losses on a GAAP basis exceeds the combined gross reserves of our insurance subsidiaries on a statutory basis by approximately $0.2 billion, which is principally due to the portion of the GAAP reserve for losses that is reflected for statutory accounting purposes as unearned premiums. These unearned premiums are applicable to extended reporting endorsements ( tail\u201d coverage) issued without a premium charge upon death, disability or retirement of an insured who meets certain qualifications.\nWe provide capital to Lloyd's of London Syndicate 1729 and Syndicate 6131 which represents 11% of our gross premiums written in 2019. As previously discussed, to reduce our exposure and the associated earnings volatility, we decreased our participation in the operating results of Syndicate 1729 for the 2020 underwriting year from 61% to 29%. Our allocated share of Syndicate 1729's maximum underwriting capacity for 2020 is \u00a339 million (approximately $51 million at December 31, 2019). We continue to provide 100% of the capital to Syndicate 6131 which has a maximum underwriting capacity for the 2020 underwriting year of \u00a312 million (approximately $15.9 million at December 31, 2019).\n \u2022 The section entitled Cumulative net paid, as of\u201d reflects the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of each succeeding year with respect to the previously recorded Balance Sheet Reserves. \nIn addition, segment operating results for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 included the effect of two separate loss portfolio transfers; one entered into during the third quarter of 2019 and one entered into during the second quarter of 2018. A loss portfolio transfer is a form of retroactive insurance coverage as we are assuming and accepting an entity's existing open and future claim liabilities through the transfer of the entity's loss reserves. The loss portfolio transfer entered into during the third quarter of 2019 resulted in total net premiums written and earned of $2.7 million (consisting of $0.9 million of retroactive premium and $1.8 million of prospective (tail) premium) and total net losses and loss adjustment expenses of $2.1 million. The loss portfolio transfer entered into during the second quarter of 2018 resulted in total net premiums written and earned of $26.6 million (consisting of $18.7 million of retroactive premium and $7.9 million of prospective (tail) premium) and total net losses and loss adjustment expenses of $25.4 million. See further discussion of these loss portfolio transfers in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nthe loss of three accounts. The decrease in retrospective policy premiums written primarily reflects the loss of two accounts and the impact of retrospective premium adjustments which are based on the loss experience of the underlying policies. Retrospective premium adjustments in 2019 decreased premiums written by $2.1 million as compared to adjustments in 2018 that increased premiums written by $0.8 million. Other premiums written primarily reflect our participation in residual market pools in the states in which we operate; premiums are based on information provided to us by the residual market.\nThe principal components of our operating cash flows are the excess of premiums collected and net investment income over losses paid and operating costs, including income taxes. Timing delays exist between the collection of premiums and the payment of losses associated with the premiums. Premiums are generally collected within the twelve-month period after the policy is written, while our claim payments are generally paid over a more extended period of time. Likewise, timing delays exist between the payment of claims and the collection of any associated reinsurance recoveries.\n\nThe following discussion generally focuses on the change in financial condition, results of operation and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 and be should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to those statements which accompany this report. For a full discussion of the changes in the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, please refer to Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" section of ProAssurance's December 31, 2018 report on Form 10-K.\n (4) As previously discussed, as a part of our alternative market solutions, all or a portion of certain healthcare premium written is ceded to SPCs in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment under either excess of loss or quota share reinsurance agreements, depending on the structure of the individual program. See the Segment Operating Results - Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance section for further discussion on the cession to SPCs from our Specialty P&C segment. The increase in premiums ceded to SPCs during 2019 was primarily due to new business written and the renewal of multiple short-term policies written throughout 2018 that renewed on January 1, 2019 with twelve month terms (see discussion in footnote 8 under the heading \"Gross Premiums Written\"). \nWe evaluate tax positions taken on tax returns and recognize positions in our financial statements when it is more likely than not that we will sustain the position upon resolution with a taxing authority. If recognized, the benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% probability of being realized. We review uncertain tax positions each period, considering changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law, and make adjustments as we consider necessary. Adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits may\n\nThe underwriting expense ratio included the impact of the following:\n\nProAssurance Overview\nCeded Premiums Written\nBusiness Combinations and Ventures\n (3) The current accident year net loss ratio, excluding the effect of prior year ceded premium adjustments (as shown in the table above), increased 12.1 percentage points as compared to 2018. The change in the current accident year net loss ratio was primarily attributable to the following: \nOur operating ratio for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 increased by approximately 17.6 percentage points driven by a higher combined ratio in our Specialty P&C segment. The higher combined ratio in our Specialty P&C segment was driven by a higher current accident year net loss ratio and the recognition of net unfavorable development on prior accident year reserves. See previous discussion in this section under the heading \"Expenses\" and further discussion in our Segment Operating Results - Specialty Property & Casualty section that follows under the heading \"Losses.\"\nFor the workers' compensation business, each SPC has in place its own external reinsurance arrangements. The healthcare professional liability business is assumed net of reinsurance from our Specialty P&C segment; therefore, there are no ceded premiums related to the healthcare professional liability business reflected in the table above. The risk retention for each loss occurrence for the workers' compensation business ranges from $0.3 million to $0.35 million based on the program, with limits up to $119.7 million. In addition, each program has aggregate reinsurance coverage between $1.1 million and $2.1 million on a program year basis. Per the SPC external reinsurance agreements, premiums are ceded on a written premium basis and changes in ceded premiums written during 2019 primarily reflected changes in gross premiums written as compared to 2018. External reinsurance rates vary based on the alternative market program.\nNet premiums earned consist of gross premiums earned less the portion of earned premiums that we cede to our reinsurers for their assumption of a portion of our losses. Because premiums are generally earned pro rata over the entire policy period, fluctuations in premiums earned tend to lag those of premiums written. Generally, our policies carry a term of one year; however, as discussed above, we write certain policies with a twenty-four month term, and a few of our medical technology liability policies have a multi-year term. Tail coverage premiums are generally 100% earned in the period written because the policies insure only incidents that occurred in prior periods and are not cancellable. Retroactive coverage premiums are 100% earned at the inception of the contract, as all of the underlying loss events occurred in the past. Additionally, ceded premium changes due to changes to estimates of premiums owed under reinsurance agreements for prior accident years are fully earned in the period of change.\nFinancing Activities and Related Cash Flows\nAcquired Reserve\nDevelopment of Prior Accident Years\n (1) We generally reinsure risks under our excess of loss reinsurance arrangements pursuant to which the reinsurers agree to assume all or a portion of all risks that we insure above our individual risk retention levels, up to the maximum individual limits offered. Premium due to reinsurers also fluctuates with the volume of written premium subject to cession under the arrangement. In certain of our excess of loss reinsurance arrangements, the premium due to the reinsurer is determined by the loss experience of that business reinsured, subject to certain minimum and maximum amounts. Due to increases in loss experience of business reinsured under those loss sensitive agreements and resulting increases in premium due to those reinsurers, we have reached the maximum level of premium due under those arrangements which is driving the decrease in ceded premiums written in 2019 as compared to 2018. \nThe financial strength of our reinsurers and their ability to pay us may change in the future due to forces or events we cannot control or anticipate. We have not experienced significant collection difficulties due to the financial condition of any reinsurer as of December 31, 2019; however, reinsurers may periodically dispute our demand for reimbursement from them based upon their interpretation of the terms of our agreements. As of December 31, 2019, reinsurance recoverables totaling approximately $92.6 million were collateralized by letters of credit or funds withheld. We had no allowance for credit losses related to our reinsurance receivables at December 31, 2019 or 2018 as all reinsurance balances were considered collectible. No reinsurance balances were written off for credit reasons during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, and reinsurance balances written off for credit reasons during the year ended December 31, 2017 were nominal in amount. Should future events lead us to believe that any reinsurer will not meet its obligations to us, adjustments to the amounts recoverable would be reflected in the results of current operations. Such an adjustment has the potential to be material to the results of operations in the period in which it is recorded; however, we would not expect such an adjustment to have a material effect on our capital position or our liquidity.\n\nA detailed discussion of factors influencing our recognition of loss development is included in our Critical Accounting Estimates section under the heading \"Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses.\" Assumptions used in establishing our reserve are regularly reviewed and updated by management as new data becomes available. Any adjustments necessary are reflected in the then current operations. Due to the size of our reserve, even a small percentage adjustment to the assumptions can have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the change is made, as was the case in both 2019 and 2018.\nRetention for our Specialty P&C segment, including by major component, was as follows:\n (6) We offer custom alternative risk solutions including loss portfolio transfers for healthcare entities that, most commonly, are exiting a line of business, changing an insurance approach or simply preferring to transfer risk. In the third quarter of 2019, we entered into a loss portfolio transfer with a regional hospital group which resulted in $0.9 million of retroactive premium written and fully earned in 2019. In the second quarter of 2018, we entered into a loss portfolio transfer with a large healthcare organization which resulted in $18.7 million of retroactive premium written and fully earned in 2018. See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these transactions. \n \u2022 The combined ratio which is the sum of the net loss ratio and the underwriting expense ratio and measures underwriting profitability. \nPremiums Written\n \u2022 Average Reported Value Method \nThe decrease in our ROE in 2019 as compared to 2018 was due to the decrease in net income, driven by a higher combined ratio in our Specialty P&C segment, as discussed above under the heading \"Operating Ratio\", largely offset by the increase in the fair value of our equity trading portfolio due to the improvement in the market since December 31, 2018.\nLoss Development by Line of Business\nUnderwriting, Policy Acquisition and Operating Expenses\nInvesting Activities and Related Cash Flows\nNet favorable reserve development recognized within our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment reflected overall favorable trends in claim closing patterns primarily in the 2015 and 2016 accident years.\nOur reserve is established by management after taking into consideration a variety of factors including premium rates, claims frequency and severity, historical paid and incurred loss development trends, the expected effect of inflation, general economic and social trends, the legal and political environment and the conclusions reached by our internal and consulting actuaries. We update and review the data underlying the estimation of our reserve for losses each reporting period and make adjustments to loss estimation assumptions that we believe best reflect emerging data. Both our internal and consulting actuaries perform an in-depth review of our reserve for losses on at least a semi-annual basis using the loss and exposure data of our insurance subsidiaries.\n \u2022 The Adjusted Reported and the Adjusted Paid Methods  A brief description of each method follows.\nOur effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2019 our reserve is comprised almost entirely of long-tail exposures. The estimation of long-tailed losses is inherently difficult and is subject to significant judgment on the part of management. Due to the nature of our claims, our loss costs, even for claims with similar characteristics, can vary significantly depending upon many factors, including but not limited to the specific characteristics of the claim and the manner in which the claim is resolved. Long-tailed insurance is characterized by the extended period of time typically required both to assess the viability of a claim and potential damages, if any, and to reach a resolution of the claim. The claims resolution process may extend to more than five years. The combination of continually changing conditions and the extended time required for claim resolution results in a loss cost estimation process that requires actuarial skill and the application of significant judgment, and such estimates require periodic modification.\n\nActivity in our net reserve for losses during 2019, 2018 and 2017 is summarized below:\n\nTreasury share activity for 2019, 2018 and 2017 was as follows:\nCeded Premiums Ratio\n\n \u2022 Reserves for 2014 include gross and net reserves acquired in 2014 business combinations of $153.2 million and $139.5 million, respectively.  In each year reflected in the table, we have estimated our reserve for losses utilizing the management and actuarial processes discussed under the heading \"Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\" in the Critical Accounting Estimates section. Factors that have contributed to the variation in loss development are primarily related to the extended period of time required to resolve professional liability claims and include the following:\nDeferred Taxes\nBecause of the number of securities we own and the complexity of developing accurate fair values, we utilize multiple independent pricing services to assist us in establishing the fair value of individual securities. The pricing services provide fair values based on exchange-traded prices, if available. If an exchange-traded price is not available, the pricing services, if possible, provide a fair value that is based on multiple broker/dealer quotes or that has been developed using pricing models. Pricing models vary by asset class and utilize currently available market data for securities comparable to ours to estimate a fair value for our securities. The pricing services scrutinize market data for consistency with other relevant market information before including the data in the pricing models. The pricing services disclose the types of pricing models used and the inputs used for each asset class. Determining fair values using these pricing models requires the use of judgment to identify appropriate comparable securities and to choose a valuation methodology that is appropriate for the asset class and available data.\n\nCeded Premiums Written\nIn the first step of the two-step quantitative impairment test, the fair value of a reporting unit is determined using income and market approaches and is compared to its carrying value, as described above. The estimate of fair value derived from the income approach is based on the present value of expected future cash flows, including terminal value, utilizing a market based weighted average cost of capital determined separately for each reporting unit. The estimate of fair value derived from the market approach is based on earnings multiple data derived from market information. The determination of fair value involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates, operating margins, capital expenditures, working capital requirements, tax rates, terminal growth rates, discount rates, comparable public companies and synergistic benefits available to market participants. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units to determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit. To corroborate the reporting units' valuation, we perform a reconciliation of the estimate of the aggregate fair value of the reporting units to ProAssurance's market capitalization, including consideration of a control premium. Because not all of our reporting units have goodwill, we make certain assumptions regarding the fair value of our other reporting units in reconciling to our market capitalization.\n\n\nWe have a Revolving Credit Agreement which may be used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, short-term working capital, share repurchases as authorized by the Board and support for other activities. On November 7, 2019, we executed an amendment to our Revolving Credit Agreement which extended its expiration from June 2020 to November 2024 and increased the permitted borrowings from $200 million to $250 million. In addition to the permitted borrowings of $250 million, our Revolving Credit Agreement has available a $50 million accordion feature, which, if successfully subscribed, would expand permitted borrowings up to $300 million. At December 31, 2019, there were no outstanding borrowings on our Revolving Credit Agreement and we are in compliance with the financial covenants of the Revolving Credit Agreement.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nGross premiums written by product were as follows:\n \u2022 if there is intent to sell the security; \nThe decrease in operating cash flows in 2019 as compared to 2018 of $29.1 million was primarily due to an increase in paid losses of $30.2 million, a decrease in cash received from investment income of $9.8 million and an increase in cash paid for operating expenses of $8.1 million. The increase in paid losses was driven by our Specialty P&C and Workers' Compensation Insurance segments. The increase in paid losses in our Specialty P&C segment primarily reflected higher average claims payments in 2019 as compared to 2018 and the increase in paid losses in our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment primarily reflected the timing of loss payments between periods. The decrease in cash received from investment income was primarily due to a decline in distributed earnings from our unconsolidated subsidiaries. The increase in cash paid for operating expenses was driven by an increase in brokerage expenses in our Lloyd's Syndicates segment from the continuing\nLosses\nThe following table, known as the Analysis of Reserve Development, presents information over the preceding ten years regarding the payment of our losses as well as changes to (the development of) our estimates of losses during that time period. As noted in the table, we have completed various acquisitions over the ten year period which have affected original and re-estimated gross and net reserve balances as well as loss payments.\nInvestments - Other Valuation Methodologies\nGrowth Opportunities and Outlook\nThe following sections provide an overview of our consolidated and segment results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. See the Segment Operating Results sections that follow for additional information regarding each segment's operating results. For a discussion of the changes in the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, please refer to Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" section of ProAssurance's December 31, 2018 report on Form 10-K.\nCeded premiums ratio was as follows:\nFor certain insurance policies and reinsurance contracts written in our Lloyd's Syndicates segment, premiums are initially recognized based upon estimates of ultimate premium. Estimated ultimate premium consists primarily of premium written under delegated underwriting authority arrangements, which consist primarily of binding authorities, and certain assumed reinsurance agreements. These estimates of ultimate premium are judgmental and are dependent upon certain assumptions, including historical premium trends for similar agreements. As reports are received from programs, ultimate premium estimates are revised, if necessary, with changes reflected in current operations.\n\nInvestments in tax credit partnerships are evaluated for OTTI by considering both qualitative and quantitative factors. These factors include, but are not limited to:\nApproximately $6.8 million of the $12.8 million total net favorable development recognized in 2019 related to the 2014 to 2017 accident years. The development for the 2014 to 2017 accident years represents a 13.7% reduction to the ultimates established for those reserves at December 31, 2018. Approximately $5.7 million of the $13.3 million total net favorable development recognized in 2018 related to the 2013 to 2016 accident years. The development for the 2013 to 2016 accident years represents a 12.3% reduction to the ultimates established for those reserves at December 31, 2017. Approximately $5.8 million of the $10.1 million total net favorable development recognized in 2017 related to the 2012 to 2015 accident years. The development for the 2012 to 2015 accident years represents a 12.1% reduction to the ultimates established for those reserves at December 31, 2016.\nBook Value per Share\nGross premiums written in our alternative market business decreased for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. New business and renewal pricing trends in our alternative market business for 2019 were relatively consistent with the trends in our traditional business. We retained all 22 of the available workers' compensation alternative market programs up for renewal for the year ended December 31, 2019, including 6 programs available for renewal during the fourth quarter of 2019. Additionally, we wrote one new workers' compensation alternative market program in the third quarter of 2019.\nUnderwriting, policy acquisition and operating expenses includes the amortization of commissions, premium taxes and underwriting salaries, which are capitalized and deferred over the related workers' compensation policy period, net of ceding commissions earned. The capitalization of underwriting salaries can vary as they are subject to the success rate of our contract acquisition efforts. These expenses also include a management fee charged by our Corporate segment, which represents intercompany charges pursuant to a management agreement, and the amortization of intangible assets, primarily related to the acquisition of Eastern by ProAssurance. The management fee is based on the extent to which services are provided to the subsidiary and the amount of premium written by the subsidiary.\nOther underwriting and operating expenses primarily include bank fees, professional fees, bad debt expense and a provision for federal income taxes paid by the SPCs. The increase in other underwriting and operating expense for the year\nTwo of our insurance subsidiaries are members of an FHLB. Through membership, those subsidiaries have access to secured cash advances which can be used for liquidity purposes or other operational needs. In order for us to use FHLB proceeds, regulatory approvals may be required depending on the nature of the transaction. To date, those subsidiaries have not materially utilized their membership for borrowing purposes.\nWhen testing goodwill for impairment on our annual test date, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not, we are then required to perform the two-step quantitative impairment test; otherwise, no further analysis is required. We also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test.\nGross premiums earned during 2019 and 2018 included the effects of two different loss portfolio transfers which resulted in $2.7 million and $26.6 million, respectively, of one-time premium written and fully earned in the respective periods (see discussion under the heading \"Gross Premiums Written\"). After removing the impacts of the loss portfolio transfers from each period, gross premiums earned increased $24.7 million due to by the pro rata effect of an increase in the volume of written premium during the preceding twelve months, predominantly in our physicians and healthcare facilities lines of business driven by an increase in renewal pricing.\n\n \u2022 Paid Development Method \n\n \u2022 Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance - This segment includes the operating results (underwriting profit or loss, plus investment results) of SPCs at Inova Re and Eastern Re, our Cayman Islands SPC operations. Each SPC is owned, fully or in part, by an agency, group or association, and the operating results of the SPCs are due to the participants of that cell. We participate to a varying degree in the results of selected SPCs and, for the SPCs in which we participate, our participation interest ranges from a low of 20% to a high of 85%. SPC operating results attributable to external cell participants are reflected as an SPC dividend expense (income) in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment. The SPCs assume workers' compensation insurance, healthcare professional liability insurance or a combination of the two from our Workers' Compensation Insurance and Specialty P&C segments. In addition, an SPC at Eastern Re assumed an errors and omissions liability policy from a captive insurer unaffiliated with ProAssurance during 2019. We do not participate in the SPC that assumed this policy; therefore, the operating results of this policy are reflected in the SPC dividend expense (income). \nUnderwriting Expense Ratio (the Expense Ratio)\nsubjective process that is inherently likely to prove inaccurate over time. Given the long tail and volatility, we are generally cautious in making changes to the severity assumptions within our pricing models. All open claims and accident years are generally impacted by a change in the severity trend, which compounds the effect of such a change.\n \u2022 Specialty P&C - This segment includes our professional liability business and medical technology liability business. Professional liability insurance is primarily offered to healthcare providers and institutions and, to a lesser extent, to attorneys and their firms. Medical technology liability insurance is offered to medical technology and life sciences companies that manufacture or distribute products including entities conducting human clinical trials. We also offer custom alternative risk solutions including loss portfolio transfers, assumed reinsurance and captive cell programs for healthcare professional liability insureds. For our alternative market captive cell programs, we cede either all or a portion of the premium to certain SPCs in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment. \nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\n \u2022 The HCPL legal environment deteriorated in the late 1990's and severity began to increase at a greater pace than anticipated in our rates and reserve estimates. We addressed the adverse severity trends through increased rates, stricter underwriting and modifications to claims handling procedures, and reflected this adverse severity trend when we established our initial reserves for subsequent years. \nThe following table shows our consolidated net investment result:\n (3) We have entered into various shared risk arrangements, including quota share, fronting and captive arrangements, with certain large healthcare systems and other insurance entities. These arrangements include our Ascension Health and CAPAssurance programs. While we cede a large portion of the premium written under these arrangements, they provide us an opportunity to grow net premium through strategic partnerships. The increase in 2019 was primarily driven by growth in our CAPAssurance program, partially offset by a decrease in exposure related to one of our Ascension Health programs. \nNet premiums earned were as follows:\nA valuation allowance was established in a prior year against the deferred tax asset related to the NOL carryforwards for the U.K. operations as management concluded that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We also established a valuation allowance in a prior year against the deferred tax assets of certain SPCs at our recently formed wholly owned Cayman Islands reinsurance subsidiary, Inova Re. Due to the limited operations of these recently formed SPCs, management concluded that a valuation allowance was required. As of December 31, 2019, management concluded that a valuation allowance was still required against the deferred tax assets related to the NOL carryforwards for the U.K. operations and against the deferred tax assets of certain SPCs at Inova Re. See further discussion in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n (2) Prior to January 1, 2018, our Specialty P&C segment ceded premiums to Syndicate 1729 under a quota share reinsurance agreement. We record our participation in Syndicate 1729 in our Lloyd's Syndicates segment on a quarter lag, except when information is material to the current period. We also recorded the cession to Syndicate 1729 from our Specialty P&C segment on the same quarter lag as the amounts were not material and that permitted the cession to be reported by both our Lloyd's Syndicates segment and our Specialty P&C segment in the same reporting period. The decrease in premiums ceded to Syndicate 1729 during 2019 is due to the non-renewal of the quota share reinsurance agreement with Syndicate 1729 on January 1, 2018; the impact of which was not reflected in ceded premiums written until the second quarter of 2018 due to the previously mentioned quarter lag. See the Segment Operating Results - Lloyd's Syndicates section for further discussion on the quota share agreement. \nUnder the terms of certain of our reinsurance agreements, the amount of premium that we cede to our reinsurers is based in part on the losses we recover under the agreements. Therefore, we make an estimate of premiums ceded under these reinsurance agreements subject to certain maximums and minimums. Any adjustments to our estimates of losses recoverable under our reinsurance agreements or the premiums owed under our agreements are reflected in then current operations. Due to the size of our reinsurance balances, an adjustment to these estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is made.\nThe pricing services provide a single value per instrument quoted. We review the values provided for reasonableness each quarter by comparing market yields generated by the supplied value versus market yields observed in the marketplace. We also compare yields indicated by the provided values to appropriate benchmark yields and review for values that are unchanged or that reflect an unanticipated variation as compared to prior period values. We utilize a primary pricing service for each security type and compare provided information for consistency with alternate pricing services, known market data and information from our own trades, considering both values and valuation trends. We also review weekly trades versus the prices supplied by the services. If a supplied value appears unreasonable, we discuss the valuation in question with the pricing service and make adjustments if deemed necessary. Historically our review has not resulted in any material changes to the values supplied by the pricing services. The pricing services do not provide a fair value unless an exchange-traded price or multiple observable inputs are available. As a result, the pricing services may provide a fair value for a security in some periods but not others, depending upon the level of recent market activity for the security or comparable securities.\nROE\nOur broader HCPL excess and surplus lines of business include custom physicians, healthcare facilities, correctional healthcare and long-term care policies. Also as a result of our annual actuarial analysis, we increased our reserves related to DDR coverage endorsements in 2019 as compared to a decrease in 2018 which accounted for 2.9 percentage points of the increase in the current accident year net loss ratio. Furthermore, as part of our quarterly evaluation of the recoverability of DPAC, we recognized a PDR of $9.2 million which accounted for 1.9 percentage points of the increase in the current accident year net loss ratio. The PDR represents an estimated premium deficiency associated with the unearned premium of the aforementioned large national healthcare account which is reflected as a component of our current accident year net losses; no such reserves were established in 2018. The remaining increase in our current accident year net loss ratio of 1.3 percentage points was primarily due to changes in the mix of business. Current accident year loss ratios for our core physicians, podiatric, chiropractic, legal professional liability and medical technology liability businesses were relatively unchanged as compared to 2018.\n \u2022 if it is more likely than not that the security will be required to be sold before full recovery of its amortized cost basis; or \n \u2022 Catastrophic protection is utilized on both our property insurance and casualty coverages to protect against losses in excess of policy limits as well as natural catastrophes. \n\nA schedule of our non-cancellable contractual obligations at December 31, 2019 was as follows:\nPremiums Written\nended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily reflected an increase in the provision for federal income taxes and fees related to letters of credit posted as program collateral. The provision for federal income taxes totaled $1.1 million and $0.4 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nIn 2019, 2018 and 2017 the development was largely attributable to favorable results from claims closed during the year. As time has elapsed we have recognized that actual loss experience has on average been better than estimated. We have been cautious in recognizing the improvement, but as claims have matured and claims are closed or have become more certain for the remaining open claims, we have revised reserve estimates. We believe the need for a cautious approach is required as outcomes are uncertain and results can be significantly affected by outcomes for a small number of cases.\nWe are involved in various legal actions related to insurance policies and claims handling including, but not limited to, claims asserted against us by policyholders. These types of legal actions arise in the ordinary course of business and, in accordance with GAAP for insurance entities, are generally considered as a part of our loss reserving process, which is described in detail in our Critical Accounting Estimates section under the heading \"Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses.\" We also have other direct actions against the Company unrelated to our claims activity which we evaluate and account for as a part of our other liabilities. For these corporate legal actions, we evaluate each case separately and establish what we believe is an appropriate reserve based on GAAP guidance related to contingent liabilities. As of December 31, 2019 there were no material reserves established for corporate legal actions.\nExecutive Summary of Operations\nCertain of our investments, in accordance with GAAP for the type of investment, are measured using methodologies other than fair value. At December 31, 2019, these investments represented approximately 5% of total investments, and are detailed in the following table. Additional information about these investments is provided in Notes 2 and 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nSegment Operating Results - Workers' Compensation Insurance\nConsolidated net premiums earned for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 included the effects of two different loss portfolio transfers in our Specialty P&C segment which resulted in $2.7 million and $26.6 million, respectively, of one-time premium written and fully earned in the respective periods. See further discussion of these loss portfolio transfers in our Segment Operating Results - Specialty Property & Casualty section that follows. After removing the impacts of the 2019 and 2018 loss portfolio transfers, consolidated net premiums earned increased $52.6 million during 2019 as compared to 2018. All of our operating segments contributed to the remaining increase in consolidated net premiums earned, particularly our Specialty P&C segment due to the pro rata effect of an increase in the volume of written premium during the preceding twelve months, predominantly in our physicians and healthcare facilities lines of business, driven by an increase in renewal pricing.\n(1) Net realized investment gains (losses) on investments related to SPCs are recognized in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment. SPC operating results, including any realized gain or loss, that are attributable to external cell participants are reflected in the SPC dividend expense (income). To be consistent with our exclusion of net realized investment gains (losses) recognized in earnings, we are excluding the portion of net realized investment gains (losses) that is included in the SPC dividend expense (income) which is attributable to the external cell participants.\nGross, ceded and net premiums written were as follows:\n \u2022 in situations where there was not a previous OTTI for the investment, whether the current expected cash flows from the investment, primarily tax benefits, are less than those expected at the time the investment was acquired due to various factors, such as a change in the statutory tax rate; or \nOur operating ratio is our combined ratio, less our investment income ratio. This ratio provides the combined effect of underwriting profitability and investment income. Our operating ratio for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was as follows:\nPremiums Written\n \u2022 Lloyd's Syndicates - This segment includes the operating results from our participation (61% for the 2019 underwriting year) in Lloyd's of London Syndicate 1729 and our 100% participation in Syndicate 6131, which is an SPA that underwrites on a quota share basis with Syndicate 1729. To reduce our exposure and the associated earnings volatility, we decreased our participation in the operating results of Syndicate 1729 for the 2020 underwriting year from 61% to 29%. The results of this segment are normally reported on a quarter lag, except when information is available that is material to the current period. Syndicate 1729 underwrites risks over a wide range of property and casualty insurance and reinsurance lines in both the U.S. and international markets while \naffect our income tax expense, and settlement of uncertain tax positions may require the use of cash. Other than differences related to timing, no significant adjustments were considered necessary during 2019 or 2018. At December 31, 2019, our liability for unrecognized tax benefits approximated $5.1 million.\nNet Premiums Earned\nCalendar year incurred losses (excluding IBNR) ceded to our external reinsurers decreased $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. Current accident year ceded incurred losses decreased $5.5 million as compared to 2018. The decrease in losses ceded to our external reinsurers primarily reflects the impact of the AAD, which reduced ceded losses by $3.9 million, and a reduction in reported reinsured claims during 2019.\n \u2022 The investment income ratio which is calculated as net investment income divided by net premiums earned and measures the contribution investment earnings provide to our overall profitability. \nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP. Preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts we report on those statements. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based on current and historical developments, market conditions, industry trends and other information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We can make no assurance that actual results will conform to our estimates and assumptions; reported results of operations may be materially affected by changes in these estimates and assumptions.\nLosses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nHowever, from early 2017 to December 31, 2019, the average charged premium rates on our standard physician renewal business have increased by approximately 4% per annum, and we anticipate further rate increases due to indications of increasing loss severity.\nWhen a lease of an office facility is to be abandoned and will not be subleased, we first evaluate whether or not the operating lease ROU asset's inclusion in an existing asset group continues to be appropriate and if the commitment to abandon the lease constitutes a change in circumstances requiring the operating lease ROU asset, or the larger asset group, to be tested for impairment. If an impairment test is required, it is performed in the same manner as discussed above. Any remaining carrying value of the operating lease ROU asset is amortized from the date we commit to a plan to abandon the lease to the expected date that we will cease to use the leased property. Leases to be abandoned in which we have the intent or practical ability to sublease continue to be accounted for under a held and use model, with no change to the amortization period of the operating lease ROU asset, and are evaluated for impairment as a separate asset group at the date the sublease is executed.\n\nUnderwriting, Policy Acquisition and Operating Expenses\nThe table includes losses on both a direct and an assumed basis and is net of anticipated reinsurance recoverables. The gross liability for losses before reinsurance, as shown on the balance sheet, and the reconciliation of that gross liability to amounts net of reinsurance are reflected below the table. We do not discount our reserve for losses to present value. Information presented in the table is cumulative and, accordingly, each amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts for prior years. The table presents the development of our balance sheet reserve for losses; it does not present accident year or policy year development data. Conditions and trends that have affected the development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur in the future. Accordingly, it is not appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based on this table.\nThe largest component of our liabilities is our reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses (\"reserve for losses\" or \"reserve\"), and the largest component of expense for our operations is incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as losses and loss adjustment expenses,\u201d incurred losses,\u201d losses incurred\u201d and losses\u201d). Incurred losses reported in any period reflect our estimate of losses incurred related to the premiums earned in that period as well as any changes to our previous estimate of the reserve required for prior periods.\nWe recognized net favorable prior year development of $10.1 million and $9.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The net favorable prior year reserve development for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily reflected overall favorable trends in claim closing patterns, primarily in the 2015 through 2018 accident years. The net favorable prior year reserve development for the year ended December 31, 2018 also primarily reflected overall favorable trends in claim closing patterns, primarily in the 2015 through 2017 accident years.\nIn addition to setting the initial reserve for the current accident year, each period we reassess the amount of reserve required for prior accident years.\nAs previously noted, the number of data points and variables considered and the subjective process followed in establishing our loss reserve makes it impractical to isolate individual variables and demonstrate their impact on our estimate of loss reserves. However, to provide a better understanding of the potential variability in our reserves, we have modeled implied reserve ranges around our single point net reserve estimates for our various lines of business assuming different confidence levels. The ranges have been developed by aggregating the expected volatility of losses across partitions of our business to obtain a consolidated distribution of potential reserve outcomes. The aggregation of this data takes into consideration correlations among our geographic and specialty mix of business. The result of the correlation approach to aggregation is that the ranges are narrower than the sum of the ranges determined for each partition.\n \u2022 ROE which is calculated as net income divided by the average of beginning and ending shareholders' equity. This ratio measures our overall after-tax profitability and shows how efficiently capital is being used. \nFor the workers' compensation business ceded to Inova Re and Eastern Re, each SPC has in place its own reinsurance arrangements; which are illustrated in the following table.\n\nWe have also been a consistent acquirer of other physician insurers, completing four acquisitions between 2009 and 2013 as well as acquiring an agency largely focused on the professional liability needs of allied healthcare providers, an insurer focused on the legal professional liability market and a mutual company that focused on medical technology liability insurance for companies that manufacture or distribute medical products.\nThe following table shows our total consolidated net realized investment gains (losses):\n \u2022 the current credit standing of the issuer, including credit rating downgrades, whether before or after the balance sheet date; \nExcluding the impact of the errors and omissions liability policy, as shown above, the current accident year net loss ratio increased in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to an increase in severity-related claims activity.\nAt December 31, 2019, our debt included $250 million of outstanding unsecured senior notes. The notes bear interest at 5.3% annually and are due in 2023 although they may be redeemed in whole or part prior to maturity. There are no financial covenants associated with these notes.\nReinsurance\nAt December 31, 2019, there were no outstanding borrowings on our Revolving Credit Agreement; however, the above table includes unused commitment fees associated with our Revolving Credit Agreement as we presume the full unused facility will remain available through expiration of the agreement in November 2024. Additionally, we presume the current interest rate on our Mortgage Loans at December 31, 2019 will remain constant until maturity of the Mortgage Loans in December 2027. For more information regarding these agreements see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n \u2022 the extent to which the decline in fair value is attributable to credit risk specifically associated with the security or its issuer; \nThe increase in our alternative market healthcare facilities premium during 2019 was primarily due to new business written, including the addition of one large policy totaling $1.4 million. The remaining increase was attributable to multiple short-term policies written throughout 2018 that renewed on January 1, 2019 with twelve month terms.\nExcluding the effects of audit premium and the provision for U.S. federal income taxes, the underwriting expense ratio primarily reflected the weighted average ceding commission percentage of all SPC programs.\n\nWe recognized net favorable development related to our previously established reserves of $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $8.0 million for 2018. The net favorable prior year development for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 reflected overall favorable trends in claim closing patterns, primarily in the 2015 and 2016 accident years. For each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the net favorable prior year development included $1.6 million related to the amortization of the purchase accounting fair value adjustment. The fair value adjustment has been fully amortized as of December 31, 2019.\n2018 in our Specialty P&C segment (see further discussion in our Segment Operating Results - Specialty Property & Casualty section that follows). Excluding the impact of the 2018 loss portfolio transfer, our consolidated underwriting expense ratio for 2019 was relatively unchanged as compared to 2018 driven by an increase in consolidated net premiums earned which outpaced the increase in consolidated DPAC amortization, offset by an increase operating expenses in our Specialty P&C segment driven by fees associated with a data analytics services agreement entered into during the fourth quarter of 2018.\nFor all of our segments, we make a determination of the amount of insurance risk we choose to retain based upon numerous factors, including our risk tolerance and the capital we have to support it, the price and availability of reinsurance, the volume of business, our level of experience with a particular set of claims and our analysis of the potential underwriting results. We purchase excess of loss reinsurance to limit the amount of risk we retain and we do so from a number of companies to mitigate concentrations of credit risk. We utilize reinsurance brokers to assist us in the placement of these reinsurance programs and in the analysis of the credit quality of our reinsurers. The determination of which reinsurers we choose to do business with is based upon an evaluation of their then current financial strength, rating and stability. However, the financial strength of our reinsurers and their corresponding ability to pay us may change in the future due to forces or events we cannot control or anticipate. As of December 31, 2019, there is no reinsurer, on an individual basis, for which our recoverables for both paid and unpaid claims (net of amounts due to the reinsurer) and our prepaid balances are aggregately $40 million or more.\nWe utilize the selected point estimates of ultimate losses to develop estimates of ultimate losses recoverable from reinsurers, based on the terms and conditions of our reinsurance agreements. An overall estimate of the amount receivable from reinsurers is determined by combining the individual estimates. Our net reserve estimate is the gross reserve point estimate less the estimated reinsurance recovery.\n\n\nOur Specialty P&C segment focuses on professional liability insurance and medical technology liability insurance as discussed in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment operating results reflected pre-tax underwriting profit or loss from these insurance lines, exclusive of investment results, which are included in our Corporate segment. Segment operating results included the following:\n \u2022 Reserves for 2009 and thereafter include gross and net reserves acquired in 2009 business combinations of $169.4 million and $163.9 million, respectively. \nWe believe our position in the healthcare liability space is strengthened by our ability to offer synergistic solutions through our operations at Eastern, a provider of workers' compensation insurance which currently represents the second largest product line in our gross premiums written (28% in 2019, including alternative market premiums). The workers' compensation industry is highly competitive in the geographic markets in which we operate and multi-line insurers continue to increase their leverage of workers' compensation business in their product offerings. We believe our workers' compensation product offerings allow us to provide flexibility in offering solutions to our customers at a competitive price. In addition, we believe that our claims handling and risk management services are attractive to our customers and provide us with a competitive advantage even when our pricing is higher than our competitors.\nGross premiums written reflected reinsurance premiums assumed by component as follows:\nThe foundation of our reserve re-estimation process is an actuarial analysis that is performed by both our internal and consulting actuaries. This very detailed analysis projects ultimate losses based on partitions which include line of business, geography, coverage layer and accident year. The procedure uses the most representative data for each partition, capturing its unique patterns of development and trends. In all there are over 200 different partitions of our business for purposes of this analysis. We believe that the use of consulting actuaries provides an independent view of our loss data as well as a broader perspective on industry loss trends.\nTaxes\nEach SPC has participants and the profit or loss of each cell accrues fully to these cell participants. As previously discussed, we participate in certain SPCs to a varying degree. Each SPC maintains a loss fund initially equal to the difference between premium assumed by the cell and the ceding commission. The external participants of each cell provide collateral, typically in the form of a letter of credit, to us that is initially equal to the difference between the loss fund of the SPC (amount of funds available to pay losses after deduction of ceding commission) and the aggregate attachment point of the reinsurance. Over time, an SPC's retained profits are considered in the determination of the collateral amount required to be provided by the cell's external participants.\nSyndicate 6131 focuses on contingency and specialty property business, also within the U.S. and international markets.\nOur effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were different from the statutory federal income tax rates in effect for each year primarily due to the recognition of a tax benefit from credits transferred to us from our tax credit partnership investments and, to a lesser extent, portions of our income that are exempt from federal income taxes. See further discussion, including other notable items during 2019 and 2018 in the Segment Operating Results - Corporate section that follows under the heading \"Taxes.\"\n \u2022 Reserves for 2012 and thereafter include gross and net reserves acquired in 2012 business combinations of $21.8 million and $19.2 million, respectively, which considers reductions of $3.6 million and $3.3 million, respectively, recorded in 2013 due to the re-estimation of the fair value of the acquired reserves. \nUnder our external reinsurance agreement, we retain the first $0.5 million in risk insured by us and cede losses in excess of this amount on each loss occurrence under our primary external reinsurance treaty. Effective May 1, 2019, our primary reinsurance layer was renewed with an AAD equal to the greater of $3.9 million or 2.1% of subject premium, in excess of the $0.5 million retention per loss occurrence, and the elimination of the return premium component of the contract. The addition of the AAD was partially offset by a reduction in the reinsurance rates under our renewed treaty. Per our reinsurance agreements, we cede premiums related to our traditional business on an earned premium basis. The increase in premiums ceded to external\n \u2022 third-party research and credit rating reports; \nOur receivable from reinsurers on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses represents our estimate of the amount of our reserve for losses that will be recoverable under our reinsurance programs. We base our estimate of funds recoverable upon our expectation of ultimate losses and the portion of those losses that we estimate to be allocable to reinsurers based upon the terms and conditions of our reinsurance agreements. Our assessment of the collectability of the recorded amounts receivable from reinsurers considers the payment history of the reinsurer, publicly available financial and rating agency data, our interpretation of the underlying contracts and policies and responses by reinsurers.\n \u2022 These adverse severity trends later moderated, with that moderation becoming more pronounced beginning in 2009. We were cautious in giving full recognition to indications that the pace of severity increase had slowed, however we gave measured recognition of the improved trend in our reserve estimates. The favorable development was most pronounced for years 2004 to 2008, as the initial reserves for these accident years were established prior to substantial indication that severity trends were moderating. We gave stronger recognition to the lower severity trend as time elapsed and a greater percentage of claims were closed. \nWe have Mortgage Loans with one lender in connection with the recapitalization of two office buildings, which mature in December 2027. The Mortgage Loans accrue interest at three-month LIBOR plus 1.325% with principal and interest payable on a quarterly basis. At December 31, 2019, the outstanding balance of the Mortgage Loans was approximately $38 million and we are in compliance with the financial covenant of the Mortgage Loans.\nAs of the most recent goodwill impairment test performed on October 1, 2019, we elected to perform a qualitative goodwill impairment test for our Specialty P&C, Workers' Compensation Insurance and Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance reporting units. Each of these reporting units have historically had an excess of fair value over book value and based on current operations are expected to continue to do so; therefore, our annual impairment test for these reporting units was performed qualitatively. In applying the qualitative approach, management considered macroeconomic factors, industry and market conditions, cost factors that could have a negative impact on the reporting units, actual financial performance of the reporting units versus expectations and management's future business expectations. As a result of the qualitative assessments, management concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of our three reporting units that have goodwill was less than the carrying value of each reporting unit as of the testing date; therefore, no further impairment testing was required. No goodwill impairment was recorded in 2019, 2018 or 2017.\n\n (3) Our other healthcare providers are primarily dentists, chiropractors and allied health professionals. The increase in 2019 is primarily due to the timing of the prior year renewal of one policy as well as new business written. \nThe increase in DPAC amortization for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily reflected the increase in net premiums earned. The increase in other underwriting and operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 reflected an increase in compensation and benefit related costs, technology costs, including an increase in the allocation of technology costs charged by our Corporate segment, professional fees and bad debt expense.\nThe increase in operating cash flows in 2018 as compared to 2017 of $3.9 million was primarily due to an increase in premium receipts of $60.8 million, a decrease in 2018 estimated tax payments as compared to 2017 of $11.5 million and a decrease in cash paid for operating expenses of $1.6 million, partially offset by an increase in paid losses of $64.3 million and a decrease in cash received from investment income of $5.1 million. The increase in premium receipts was driven by our Specialty P&C segment, primarily due to premiums received from a loss portfolio transfer entered into during the second quarter of 2018 and, to a lesser extent, our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment, primarily due to premiums received related to the third quarter 2017 acquisition of the Great Falls book of business. The decrease in 2018 estimated tax payments was primarily due to the lower statutory federal income tax rate in 2018 as compared to 2017. The increase in paid losses was driven by all of our operating segments, particularly in our Specialty P&C segment, primarily due to the timing of loss payments between periods, and our Lloyd's Syndicates segment, primarily due to 2017 storm-related losses which were paid in 2018. The decrease in cash paid for operating expenses was primarily due to a decrease in compensation related costs, largely offset by an increase in cash paid for operating expenses in our Lloyd's Syndicates segment primarily due to the start-up of Syndicate 6131. The decrease in cash received from investment income was primarily due to a reduction in interest received on our fixed maturities portfolio resulting from lower average balances.\nCash flows between periods compare as follows:\nThe following table summarizes calendar year net loss ratios by separating losses between the current accident year and all prior accident years. Additionally, the table shows our current accident year net loss ratios were affected by revisions to our estimate of premiums owed to reinsurers related to coverages provided in prior accident years. The net loss ratios for our Specialty P&C segment were as follows:\nThere were no business combinations during the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nNew business, audit premium, retention and renewal price changes for the assumed workers' compensation premium is shown in the table below:\nIntangibles\n \u2022 Beginning in 2017, we identified potential higher severity trends in the broader HCPL industry. These trends were also reflected in increases in estimates of ultimate losses for open HCPL claims for earlier accident years, which resulted in a lower amount of favorable development recognized in 2018 and 2017 as compared to prior years. \n (4) Our legal professionals policies are primarily individual and small group policies in select areas of practice. Our legal professionals premium remained relatively unchanged in 2019 as compared to 2018 as new business written and renewal pricing increases were offset by retention losses. The increase in renewal pricing was primarily the result of an increase in the rate charged for certain renewed policies in select states due to rate filings. \nOur expense ratio for the Specialty P&C segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 was as follows:\nCeded Premiums Ratio\nWe record the majority of our investments at fair value as shown in the table below. At December 31, 2019, the distribution of our investments based on GAAP fair value hierarchies (levels) was as follows:\n \u2022 The net loss ratio which is calculated as net losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned and is a component of underwriting profitability. \nNew business opportunities, renewal pricing and retention continue to be a challenge as a result of intense competition, especially from multi-line carriers that are willing to underprice their workers' compensation products to offset other coverages. This has resulted in fewer new business opportunities, which is reflected in a 20% decline in submissions during 2019. The decrease in new business in 2019 as compared to 2018 also reflects the acquisition of the Great Falls renewal book of business in September 2017, which contributed $11.7 million of new business for the year ended December 31, 2018. Excluding the Great Falls acquisition, submissions declined 12% during 2019. Renewal pricing decreases reflect the competitive market, as well as the impact of state loss cost decreases in the majority of the states in which we write business.\nNew business, audit premium, retention and renewal price changes for both the traditional business and the alternative market business are shown in the table below:\nOther underwriting and operating expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily driven by $4.9 million of fees incurred in 2019 as compared to $1.0 million in 2018 associated with a data analytics services agreement entered into during the fourth quarter of 2018, partially offset by a decrease in compensation related costs primarily due to lower bonuses. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the data analytics services agreement.\nManagement fees are charged pursuant to a management agreement by the Corporate segment to the operating subsidiaries within our Specialty P&C segment for services provided based on the extent to which services are provided to the subsidiary and the amount of premium written by the subsidiary. While the terms of the management agreement were consistent between 2019 and 2018, fluctuations in the amount of premium written by each subsidiary can result in corresponding variations in the management fee charged to each subsidiary during a particular period.\nWithin our Lloyd's Syndicates segment, Syndicate 1729 utilizes reinsurance to provide capacity to write larger limits of liability on individual risks, to provide protection against catastrophic loss and to provide protection against losses in excess of policy limits. The level of reinsurance that Syndicate 1729 purchases is dependent on a number of factors, including its underwriting risk appetite for catastrophic exposure, the specific risks inherent in each line or class of business written and the pricing, coverage and terms and conditions available from the reinsurance market. Reinsurance protection by line of business is as follows:\nOur consolidated and segment underwriting expense ratios were as follows:\nEach dividend was paid in the month following the quarter in which it was declared. Cash dividends totaling $93 million, $316 million and $315 million were paid during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Any decision to pay future cash dividends is subject to the Board's final determination after a comprehensive review of financial performance, future expectations and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.\nCalendar year incurred losses ceded to our external reinsurers increased $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. Current accident year ceded incurred losses increased $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. The increase in current accident year ceded incurred losses primarily reflected the impact of four claims totaling $11.2 million, of which $8.3 million related to two claims, incurred in 2019.\nExpenses\nGross, ceded and net premiums written were as follows:\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. All of our fixed maturity and equity investments are carried at fair value. The fair value of our short-term securities approximates the cost of the securities due to their short-term nature.\nThe decrease in our consolidated net investment result in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily attributable to a decrease in earnings (loss) from our unconsolidated subsidiaries, somewhat offset by an increase in net investment income. Equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated subsidiaries includes our share of the operating results of interests we hold in certain LPs/LLCs as well as operating losses associated with our tax credit partnership investments, which are designed to generate returns in the form of tax credits and tax-deductible project operating losses. During 2019, the earnings generated from our LPs/LLCs did not exceed the operating losses recorded from our tax credit partnership investments resulting in an overall loss from investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries as compared to earnings from investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2018. The decrease in earnings generated from our LPs/LLCs in 2019 was driven by lower reported earnings from two LP investments, somewhat offset by lower operating losses from our tax credit partnership investments. The increase in net investment income in 2019 was primarily due to an increase in interest earned on our FAL in our Lloyd's Syndicate segment due to a higher average balance in 2019 as compared to 2018. Our FAL primarily includes investment-grade corporate debt securities deposited with Lloyd's.\n \u2022 Workers' Compensation Insurance - This segment includes our workers' compensation insurance business which is provided primarily to employers with 1,000 or fewer employees. Our workers' compensation products include guaranteed cost policies, policyholder dividend policies, retrospectively-rated policies, deductible policies and alternative market solutions. Alternative market program premiums are 100% ceded to either SPCs in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment or, to a limited extent, an unaffiliated captive insurer. \nWe have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements/guarantees that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. See more information on our off-balance sheet arrangements in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nReinsurance\nThe change in renewal pricing for our Specialty P&C segment, including by major component, was as follows:\n\nThe following table is a reconciliation of net income to Non-GAAP operating income (loss):\n (2) During 2019 and 2018, we increased the premiums owed under reinsurance agreements for prior accident years which decreased net premiums earned (the denominator of the current accident year ratio). See the discussion in the Premiums section for our Specialty P&C segment under the heading \"Ceded Premiums Written\" for additional information. \nThe anticipated payout of losses and loss adjustment expenses is based upon our historical payout patterns. Both the timing and amount of these payments may vary from the payments indicated.\nOther Reinsurance Arrangements\n \u2022 The operating ratio which is the combined ratio, less the investment income ratio. This ratio provides the combined effect of underwriting profitability and investment income. \nNet premiums earned consist of gross premiums earned less the portion of earned premiums that we cede to SPCs in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment, external reinsurers or to any unaffiliated captive insurers. Because premiums are generally earned pro rata over the entire policy period, fluctuations in premiums earned tend to lag those of premiums written. Our workers' compensation policies are twelve month term policies, and premiums are earned on a pro rata basis over the policy period. Net premiums earned also include premium adjustments related to the audit of our insureds' payrolls. Payroll audits are conducted subsequent to the end of the policy period and any related adjustments are recorded as fully earned in the current period. In addition, we record an estimate for EBUB and evaluate the estimate on a quarterly basis. We did not adjust the EBUB estimate during the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018. The increase in net premiums earned primarily reflected the pro rata effect of higher net premiums written during the preceding twelve months, partially offset by the retrospective policy premium adjustments, as previously discussed.\nLitigation\n\nUnderwriting Expense Ratio (the Expense Ratio)\nNet premiums earned consist of gross premiums earned less the portion of earned premiums that the SPCs cede to external reinsurers. Because premiums are generally earned pro rata over the entire policy period, fluctuations in premiums earned tend to lag those of premiums written. Policies ceded to the SPCs are twelve month term policies and premiums are earned on a pro rata basis over the policy period. Net premiums earned also include premium adjustments related to the audit of workers' compensation insureds' payrolls. Payroll audits are conducted subsequent to the end of the policy period and any related adjustments are recorded as fully earned in the current period. The increase in net premiums earned primarily reflected the pro rata effect of higher net premiums written during the preceding twelve months.\nInvestment fund LPs/LLCs are by nature less liquid and may involve more risk than other investments. We manage our risk through diversification of asset class and geographic location. At December 31, 2019, we had investments in 37 separate investment funds with a total carrying value of $310.3 million which represented approximately 9% of our total investments. We review and monitor the performance of these investments on a quarterly basis.\nProfessional Liability\nGross, ceded and net premiums written were as follows:\nOur Lloyd's Syndicates segment includes operating results from our participation in certain Syndicates at Lloyd's of London. In addition to our participation in Syndicate operating results, we have investments in and other obligations to our Lloyd's Syndicates consisting of a Syndicate Credit Agreement and FAL requirements. For the 2019 underwriting year, our FAL was comprised of investment securities and cash and\nDPAC amortization primarily represented ceding commissions, which vary by program and are paid to our Workers' Compensation Insurance and Specialty P&C segments for premiums assumed. Ceding commissions include an amount for fronting fees, commissions, premium taxes and risk management fees, which are reported as an offset to underwriting, policy acquisition and operating expenses within our Workers' Compensation Insurance and Specialty P&C segments. In addition, ceding commissions paid to our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment include cell rental fees which are recorded as other income within our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment.\nWe generally reinsure risks under treaties (our excess of loss reinsurance agreements) pursuant to which the reinsurers agree to assume all or a portion of all risks that we insure above our individual risk retention levels, up to the maximum individual limits offered. These agreements are negotiated and renewed annually. Renewal dates for our healthcare professional liability, medical technology liability and workers' compensation treaties are October 1, January 1 and May 1, respectively. Our healthcare professional liability treaty renewed October 1, 2019 at a higher rate than the previous agreement, partially offset by a lower intermediary compensation rate. Our medical technology liability treaty renewed January 1, 2020 at a lower rate than the previous agreement. Our workers' compensation treaty renewed May 1, 2019 at a lower rate than the previous agreement; however, the lower rate reflects the addition of an AAD and the elimination of the return premium component of the contract. The significant coverages provided by our current excess of loss reinsurance agreements are detailed in the following table.\n\n\nLarge healthcare professional liability risks that are above the limits of our basic reinsurance treaties are reinsured on a facultative basis, whereby the reinsurer agrees to insure a particular risk up to a designated limit. We also have in place a number of risk sharing arrangements that apply to the first $1 million of losses for certain large healthcare systems and other insurance entities, as well as with certain insurance agencies that produce business for us.\nVariability of Loss Reserves\nOur Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment underwriting, policy acquisition and operating expenses were comprised as follows:\nWe evaluate our operating lease ROU assets for impairment at the asset group level whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of an asset group, which includes the operating lease ROU asset and the related operating lease liability, is not recoverable if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group over the life of the primary asset in the asset group. That assessment is based on the carrying amount of the asset group, including the operating lease ROU asset and the related operating lease liability, at the date it is tested for recoverability and an impairment loss is measured and recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. Any impairment loss is allocated to each asset in the asset group, including the operating ROU asset.\nClaims in our workers' compensation line of business have historically closed at a faster rate than in our HCPL or medical technology liability lines of business. This faster disposition rate, along with a lower net retention after the application of reinsurance, has resulted in less volatility in loss estimates on a net basis. However, a change in the number of individually-severe claims can create volatility in a given accident year. The following table presents additional information about the loss development for our workers' compensation line of business:\ncomponent of the reserve for losses on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. For the year ended December 31, 2019, a nominal amount of DPAC was charged to expense as it was determined to be unrecoverable, and a $9.2 million PDR was established in our Specialty P&C segment related to a large national healthcare account. See further discussion on the PDR in the Segment Operating Results - Specialty Property & Casualty section that follows. No amounts were determined to be unrecoverable for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWe use insurance and reinsurance (collectively, reinsurance\u201d) to provide capacity to write larger limits of liability, to provide reimbursement for losses incurred under the higher limit coverages we offer, to provide protection against losses in excess of policy limits and, in the case of risk sharing arrangements, to align our objectives with those of our strategic business partners and to provide custom insurance solutions for large customer groups. The purchase of reinsurance does not relieve us from the ultimate risk on our policies; however, it does provide reimbursement for certain losses we pay.\nCeded premiums written were as follows:\nSee table notes on following page.\nCeded Premiums Ratio\nreinsurers during the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily reflected an increase in earned premium, partially offset by the impact of lower reinsurance rates for the treaty year effective May 1, 2019.\n \u2022 Book value per share which is calculated as total shareholders' equity at the balance sheet date divided by the total number of common shares outstanding. This ratio measures the net worth of the company to shareholders on a per-share basis. The declaration of dividends decreases book value per share. Growth in book value per share, adjusted for dividends declared, is an indicator of overall profitability.  We particularly focus on our combined ratio and investment returns, both of which directly affect our ROE and growth in our book value. We currently target a dynamic long-term ROE of 700 basis points above the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate, which at December 31, 2019 was approximately 8.9%.\nLevel 3 Investments\n\n(2) The 21% rate is the statutory rate associated with the taxable or tax deductible items listed above. See previous discussion in this section under the heading \"Taxes.\"\n \u2022 recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date.  For structured securities (primarily asset-backed securities), management estimates the present value of the security's cash flows using the effective yield of the security at the date of acquisition (or the most recent implied rate used to accrete the security if the implied rate has changed as a result of a previous impairment or changes in expected cash flows). We consider the most recently available six month averages of the levels of delinquencies, defaults, severities and prepayments for the collateral (loans) underlying the securitization or, if historical data is not available, sector based assumptions to estimate expected future cash flows of these securities.\nManagement considers the following accounting estimates to be critical because they involve significant judgment by management and those judgments could result in a material effect on our financial statements.\nAs a result of our re-evaluation of previously established reserves, we recognized net unfavorable prior year reserve development of $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to net favorable prior year reserve development of $77.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Development recognized during 2019 principally related to accident years 2016 through 2018. Development recognized during 2018 principally related to accident years 2011 through 2014. Net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2019 included $51.5 million of unfavorable prior year reserve development related to our reserves for the previously mentioned large national healthcare account that has experienced losses far exceeding the assumptions we made when underwriting the account, beginning in 2016. Excluding the unfavorable development related to this account, the Specialty P&C segment recognized favorable prior year reserve development totaling $45.8 million in 2019 which included favorable loss development in our medical technology liability line of business of $12.8 million. Net favorable loss development in 2018 of $77.0 million included $13.3 million and $10.9 million attributable to our medical technology liability and legal professional liability lines of business, respectively. While the majority of our reserves continue to develop favorably, the favorable development we recognized, excluding the large national healthcare account, was lower as compared to 2018 due to the observed increase in claim severity in the broader HCPL industry.\nFor the Specialty P&C, Workers' Compensation Insurance and Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segments, the analysis performed by the consulting actuaries analyzes each partition of our business in a variety of ways and uses multiple actuarial methodologies in performing these analyses, including:\nThis can be seen in looking at both the absolute amount of reserve development recognized for the less developed accident years as well as the size of such development when compared to established ultimates for those same accident years at the end of the preceding calendar year. The following table provides this information for years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 with respect to the three then most recent prior accident years:\n (1) Net losses, as specified, divided by net premiums earned. \nLevel 1 Investments\nNet investment income for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was primarily attributable to interest earned on available-for-sale fixed maturity investments, which primarily includes investment-grade corporate debt securities. Net realized investment gains for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily reflected realized gains from the sale of equity securities. Net realized investment losses for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily reflected a decrease in the fair value of the equity securities portfolio.\nWe estimate our current accident year loss and loss adjustment expenses based on an expected loss ratio. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses for the current accident year are determined by applying the expected loss ratio to net premiums earned, which includes audit premium, for the respective period. The following table summarizes calendar year net loss ratios by separating losses between the current accident year and all prior accident years. Calendar year and current accident year net loss ratios by component were as follows:\nProAssurance Corporation is a holding company and is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. As a holding company, our principal source of external revenue is our investment revenues. In addition, dividends from our operating subsidiaries represent a significant source of funds for our obligations, including debt service and shareholder dividends. We also charge our operating subsidiaries within our Specialty P&C and Workers' Compensation Insurance segments a management fee based on the extent to which services are provided to the subsidiary and the amount of gross premium written by the subsidiary. At December 31, 2019, we held cash and liquid investments of approximately $280 million outside our insurance subsidiaries that were available for use without regulatory approval or other restriction, of which $17 million was used to pay shareholder dividends in January 2020. We also have $250 million in permitted borrowings under our Revolving Credit Agreement and an accordion feature available which, if subscribed successfully, would allow another $50 million in available funds as discussed in this section under the heading \"Debt.\" As of February 14, 2020, no borrowings were outstanding under our Revolving Credit Agreement.\nLosses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nUse of Judgment\n\n \u2022 The line entitled Reserve for losses, undiscounted and net of reinsurance recoverables\u201d reflects our reserve for losses and loss adjustment expense, less the receivables from reinsurers, each as reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the end of each year (the Balance Sheet Reserves). \nNet Premiums Earned\nAudit Premium\nNet favorable reserve development recognized within our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment primarily reflected better than expected claim trends in the 2015 through 2018 accident years. The improved claim trends reflected lower frequency and severity than anticipated at the time the reserves were established.\n\n (9) This component of gross premiums written includes all other product lines within our Specialty P&C segment. The increase during 2019 was due to a $1.5 million specialty contractual liability policy.  We are committed to a rate structure that will allow us to fulfill our obligations to our insureds, while generating competitive long-term returns for our shareholders. Our pricing continues to be based on expected losses as indicated by our historical loss data and available industry loss data. In recent years, this practice has resulted in gradual rate increases and we anticipate further rate increases due to indications of increasing loss severity. Additionally, the pricing of our business includes the effects of filed rates, surcharges and discounts. Renewal pricing also reflects changes in our exposure base, deductibles, self-insurance retention limits and other policy items.\n\nWe manage our investing cash flows to ensure that we will have sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations, taking into consideration the timing of cash flows from our investments, including interest payments, dividends and principal payments, as well as the expected cash flows to be generated by our operations as discussed in this section under the heading \"Investing Activities and Related Cash Flows.\"\nCeded premiums written were as follows:\nAs a result of actuarial analyses performed by both internal and consulting actuaries during 2019 and 2018, we increased our current accident year net loss ratio in our Specialty P&C segment in both 2019 and 2018; however, the adjustment was greater in 2019 as compared to 2018 which accounted for 3.4 percentage points of the increase in our consolidated current accident year net loss ratio. This increase in 2019 was driven by increased reserve estimates for a large national healthcare account and, to a lesser extent, in our broader HCPL excess and surplus lines of business. In addition, the higher consolidated current accident year net loss ratio reflected changes to our reserve in our Specialty P&C segment related to DDR coverage endorsements as well as a PDR of $9.2 million, which accounted for 1.7 and 1.1 percentage points, respectively, of the increase. The PDR represents an estimated premium deficiency associated with the aforementioned large national healthcare account which is reflected as a component of current accident year net losses in 2019 (see further discussion in our Segment Operating Results - Specialty Property & Casualty section that follows). Furthermore, the increase in our consolidated current accident year net loss ratio also reflected a $10 million reserve that an SPC at Eastern Re established during 2019 associated with an assumed E&O liability policy in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment which accounted for 1.2 percentage points of the increase. We do not participate in the SPC that assumed this policy; therefore, these losses are the obligation of the external cell participants and are reflected in the SPC dividend expense (income), which is an offset to expenses, and thus has no effect on our consolidated net income or Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment net operating results for 2019 (see further discussion in our Segment Operating Results - Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance section that follows).\nWe recognized net favorable reserve development of $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, of which $10.1 million related to our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment and $7.8 million related to our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment, partially offset by net unfavorable reserve development of $5.7 million and $0.4 million related to our Specialty P&C and Lloyd's Syndicates segments, respectively.\n \u2022 The underwriting expense ratio which is calculated as underwriting, policy acquisition and operating expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned and is a component of underwriting profitability. \nThe determination of calendar year losses involves the actuarial evaluation of incurred losses for the current accident year and the actuarial re-evaluation of incurred losses for prior accident years, including an evaluation of the reserve amounts required for losses in excess of policy limits.\nGross premiums written for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were primarily comprised of workers' compensation coverages assumed from our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment. Workers' compensation gross premiums written decreased during 2019, primarily reflecting the competitive workers' compensation market. The increase in healthcare professional liability gross premiums written during 2019 was driven primarily by the addition of one large policy and the renewal of certain policies in 2019 that were written on a short-term basis in 2018. We retained 100% of the available alternative market programs up for renewal during 2019, including 22 workers' compensation programs and 3 healthcare professional liability programs. Additionally, we added one new alternative market program at Inova Re during the third quarter of 2019.\nFor non-structured fixed maturities (obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions and corporate debt) the estimate of expected cash flows is determined by projecting a recovery value and a recovery time frame and assessing whether further principal and interest will be received. We consider various factors in projecting recovery values and recovery time frames, including the following:\nWe make a determination of the amount of insurance risk we choose to retain based upon numerous factors, including our risk tolerance and the capital we have to support it, the price and availability of reinsurance, the volume of business, our level of experience with a particular set of claims and our analysis of the potential underwriting results. We purchase excess of loss reinsurance to limit the amount of risk we retain and we do so from a number of companies to mitigate concentrations of credit risk. We utilize reinsurance brokers to assist us in the placement of these reinsurance programs and in the analysis of the credit quality of our reinsurers. The determination of which reinsurers we choose to do business with is based upon an evaluation of their then current financial strength, rating, stability and claims payment practices.\nCertain of the methodologies utilized to estimate the ultimate losses for each partition of our reserves consider the actual amounts paid. Paid data is particularly influential when a large portion of known claims have been closed, as is the case for older accident years. In selecting a point estimate for each partition, management considers the extent to which trends are emerging consistently for all partitions and known industry trends. Thus, actual, rather than estimated severity trends are given more consideration. If actual severity trends are lower than those estimated at the time that reserves were previously established, the recognition of favorable development is indicated. This is particularly true for older accident years where our actuarial methodologies give more weight to actual loss costs (severity).\nIn both 2019 and 2018, our consolidated calendar year net loss ratio was lower than our consolidated current accident year net loss ratio due to the recognition of consolidated net favorable prior year reserve development, as shown in the previous table. Consolidated net favorable prior year reserve development in 2019 was lower than in 2018 driven by unfavorable development recognized in our Specialty P&C segment of $5.7 million in 2019 as compared to favorable development of $77.0 million recognized in 2018. The unfavorable development recognized in our Specialty P&C segment in 2019 was driven by $51.5 million of unfavorable prior year reserve development related to the previously mentioned large national healthcare account that has experienced losses far exceeding the assumptions we made when underwriting the account, beginning in 2016. Excluding the unfavorable development related to this account, our Specialty P&C segment recognized favorable prior year reserve development totaling $45.8 million in 2019.\nNet Premiums Earned\nWorkers' Compensation Insurance Segment. Many factors affect the ultimate losses incurred for our workers' compensation coverages (10% of our consolidated gross reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2019) including but not limited to the type and severity of the injury, the age, health and occupation of the injured worker, the estimated length of disability, medical treatment and related costs, and the jurisdiction and workers' compensation laws of the state of the injury occurrence. We use various actuarial methodologies in developing our workers' compensation reserve, combined with a review of the payroll exposure base. For the current accident year, given the lack of seasoned information, the different actuarial methodologies produce results with significant variability; therefore, more emphasis is placed on supplementing results from the actuarial methodologies with trends in exposure base, medical expense inflation, general inflation, severity, and claim counts, among other things, to select an expected loss ratio.\nSegment operating results reflects our share of the underwriting and investment results of the SPCs in which we participate, and included the following:\nCeded premiums represent the amounts owed to our reinsurers for their assumption of a portion of our losses. Through our current excess of loss reinsurance arrangements we generally retain the first $1 million in risk insured by us and cede coverages in excess of this amount. For our healthcare professional liability coverages, we also retain from 4% - 9%
