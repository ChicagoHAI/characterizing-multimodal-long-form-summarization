Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules of this report and the matters described under Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for 2020 compared to 2019 is under the Results of Operations section below. Our financial condition for 2018 and results of operations for 2019 compared to 2018 can be found under Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which is incorporated herein by this reference to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 25, 2020, and is available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and the Investor Relations section of our website at www.dukerealty.com.\nBusiness Overview\nThe General Partner and Partnership collectively specialize in the ownership, management and development of industrial real estate. The General Partner is a self-administered and self-managed REIT that began operations in 1986 and is the sole general partner of the Partnership. The Partnership is a limited partnership formed in 1993, at which time all of the properties and related assets and liabilities of the General Partner, as well as proceeds from a secondary offering of the General Partner's common shares, were contributed to the Partnership. Simultaneously, the Partnership completed the acquisition of Duke Associates, a full-service commercial real estate firm operating in the Midwest whose operations began in 1972. We operate the General Partner and the Partnership as one enterprise, and therefore, our discussion and analysis refers to the General Partner and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Partnership, collectively.\nOur business operations primarily consist of two reportable operating segments: rental operations of industrial properties and service operations. Rental operations of industrial properties represent the ownership and development of industrial properties and is the primary component of our revenues and earnings. Service operations generate additional revenues from providing various real estate services primarily relating to development, construction management and property management services to customers, unconsolidated joint ventures and third-party owners.\nOur overall strategy is to increase our investment in quality industrial properties primarily through development, on both a speculative and build-to-suit basis, supplemented with acquisitions in the markets we believe have the highest growth potential.\nAt December 31, 2020, we:\n\u2022Owned or jointly controlled 537 primarily industrial properties, of which 520 properties with 152.2 million square feet were in service and 17 properties with 7.4 million square feet were under development. The 520 in-service properties were comprised of 480 consolidated properties with 140.7 million square feet and 40 unconsolidated joint venture properties with 11.5 million square feet. The 17 properties under development consisted of 16 consolidated properties with 6.9 million square feet and one unconsolidated joint venture property with 517,000 square feet.\n\u2022Owned directly, or through ownership interests in unconsolidated joint ventures (with acreage not adjusted for our percentage ownership interest), approximately 1,000 acres of land and controlled approximately 800 acres through purchase options.\nNationwide demand for industrial properties continues to be strong in the current economic environment as the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated both consumer acceptance of e-commerce and the requirements of many retailers to increase inventory levels. Our operational focus is to maintain occupancy at high levels and to focus on rental rate growth. The occupancy of our consolidated industrial portfolio increased to 97.4% at December 31, 2020 as compared to 96.6% at December 31, 2019. Our annual net effective rents for both renewals and new second generation leases, on a combined basis, for consolidated properties grew 28.2% in 2020 compared to 2019. In the current environment of rising rental rates for industrial properties in many of the markets in which we operate, we believe there is potential for continued future rental rate growth to the extent we are able to renew or backfill expiring leases and maintain high levels of occupancy.\nOperational Strategy\nOur operational focus is to drive profitability by maximizing cash from operations as well as NAREIT FFO through (i) maintaining property occupancy, increasing rental rates and prioritizing timely collection of monthly rental payments, while also keeping lease-related capital costs contained, by effectively managing our portfolio of existing properties; (ii) selectively developing new build-to-suit, substantially pre-leased and, in select markets, speculative development projects; and (iii) providing a full line of real estate services to our tenants and to third parties.\nAsset Strategy\nOur strategic objectives include (i) increasing our investment in quality industrial properties through development, including facilities with sustainable design features that will meet customer needs; (ii) acquiring properties primarily in coastal Tier 1 markets which we believe provide the best potential for future rental growth; and (iii) maintaining an optimal land inventory through selected strategic land acquisitions and new development activity. We are continuing to execute our asset strategy through a disciplined approach by identifying development opportunities, identifying select acquisition targets where the asset quality and pricing meet our objectives and continually evaluating our portfolio for disposition by regularly identifying assets that no longer meet our long-term objectives.\nCapital Strategy\nOur capital strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet by actively managing the components of our capital structure in coordination with the execution of our overall operational and asset strategies. We are focused on maintaining our current investment grade ratings from our credit rating agencies. As of December 31, 2020, our senior unsecured notes have been assigned a rating of Baa1 by Moody's Investors Services and BBB+ by Standard & Poor's Ratings Group and we are focused on maintaining such ratings in order to maintain access to liquidity. A securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization.\nIn support of our capital strategy, we employ an asset disposition program to sell certain real estate assets, which generate proceeds that can be recycled into new property investments that better fit our growth objectives or otherwise manage our capital structure.\nWe continue to focus on maintaining a balanced and flexible capital structure which includes: (i) extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our outstanding debt obligations; (ii) borrowing primarily at fixed rates; and (iii) issuing common equity as needed to maintain appropriate leverage parameters or support significant strategic developments or acquisitions. With our successes to date and continued focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet, we expect to be in a position to be opportunistic in our investment opportunities.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (\"ESG\") Strategy\nWe are focused on promoting our growth in a sustainable way, one that succeeds by delivering long-term value for our stakeholders. As part of our vision to continually set the standard for maximizing stakeholder value, we have a long-standing commitment to sustainable practices in environmental, social and corporate governance initiatives. On December 17, 2019, we adopted a Sustainable Development Policy intended to increase the operational efficiency of our buildings and promote sustainable design principles. We are committed to integrating innovative, sustainable building design features in alignment with U.S. Green Building Council's\u00ae Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (or LEED\u00ae), including constructing to LEED\u00ae criteria and achieving certification in all new developments where feasible. While we do not control most of the utility usage at our properties, we have been partnering with a third party data management provider since 2018 in order to help monitor and manage the utility usage that we do control. In 2018, we also became a member of GRESB, a leading provider of real estate ESG benchmarking and performance assessments. Since joining, our GRESB score has steadily increased, evidencing our commitment and continued progress. We expect to continue participating in the GRESB benchmarking assessments.\nIn October 2018, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board issued the Real Estate Sustainability Accounting Standards. The standards are intended to provide a minimum set of sustainability metrics for disclosure in SEC filings, such as this Form 10-K. We understand the importance of reporting comparable, consistent and financially material sustainability metrics. Below is a chart showing our information for the applicable metrics.\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Topic </td> <td>Accounting Metric </td> <td>Code </td> <td>Our Information </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy Management </td> <td>Description of how building energy management considerations are integrated into property investment analysis and operational strategy\n</td> <td>IF-RE-130a.5 </td> <td>We integrate energy usage reduction measures on all new developments, incorporating LEED certification requirements and applicable aspects of our own sustainability policies/programs.

These notes are our second green bond issuance with the first issuance completed in November 2019. The net proceeds will be used to finance future or refinance recently completed eligible green projects\u201d. These projects may include green buildings, energy efficiency projects, sustainable water and wastewater management systems, renewable energy projects, clean transportation solutions and pollution prevention and control.\nIn addition to our environmental initiatives, we are committed to fair compensation, fostering a dynamic and balanced work environment and providing employees with developmental opportunities to perform well and derive satisfaction from their work. We encourage our associates to participate in volunteer and community activities and support those who do participate by providing each associate with two paid community days per year. We also have charitable contribution programs, such as our dollars for doers program (matching dollars for volunteer hours spent) and our matching gifts program (matching dollars for employee donations to charities). In addition, we partner with various charitable organizations, including the American Red Cross since 2017. We maintain a formal and structured diversity, equity and inclusion program. We have increased diversity within our board of directors and 50% of the Independent Directors of the board are female or people of color. We implemented a Vendor Code of Conduct that outlines our expectations and standards for how our vendors operate while doing business on our behalf. Through all of these initiatives and others, we endeavor to make a positive impact on the communities in which we conduct business.\nWe strive to maintain an effective corporate governance structure and comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations and policies. Further, we publish Corporate Responsibility Reports that formally communicate our commitments and leadership around ESG issues. Please see Item 1 - Corporate Governance\u201d for more information regarding our governance initiatives.\nThrough all of our environmental, social and governance efforts, we demonstrate that operating and developing commercial real estate can be conducted with a conscious regard for the environment and community, while also benefiting our investors, employees, tenants and the communities in which we operate.\nResults of Operations\nA summary of our operating results and property statistics for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, is as follows (in thousands, except number of properties and per share or per Common Unit data):\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental and related revenue from continuing operations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>929,194 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>855,833 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>785,319 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General contractor and service fee revenue </td> <td>64,004 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>117,926 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>162,551 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income </td> <td>417,846 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>524,761 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>460,356 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General Partner </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to common shareholders </td> <td>$ </td> <td>299,915 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>428,972 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>383,729 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average common shares outstanding </td> <td>370,057 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>362,234 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>357,569 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average common shares and potential dilutive securities </td> <td>374,156 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>367,339 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>363,297 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Partnership </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to common unitholders </td> <td>$ </td> <td>302,578 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>432,650 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>387,257 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average Common Units outstanding </td> <td>373,360 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>365,352 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>360,859 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average Common Units and potential dilutive securities </td> <td>374,156 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>367,339 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>363,297 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General Partner and Partnership </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic income per common share or Common Unit: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Continuing operations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.81 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.06 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discontinued operations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.01 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted income per common share or Common Unit: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Continuing operations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.80 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.06 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discontinued operations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.01 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of in-service consolidated properties at end of year </td> <td>480 </td> <td> </td> <td>459 </td> <td> </td> <td>462 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In-service consolidated square footage at end of year </td> <td>140,722 </td> <td> </td> <td>135,451 </td> <td> </td> <td>133,047 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of in-service unconsolidated joint venture properties at end of year </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> <td>38 </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In-service unconsolidated joint venture square footage at end of year </td> <td>11,467 </td> <td> </td> <td>10,976 </td> <td> </td> <td>11,101 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear in Review\nThe United States economy in 2020 experienced an unprecedented downturn as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic with the gross domestic product declining by 3.5%. The recession was caused by dramatic changes in consumer behavior linked to business shutdowns, travel restrictions, and social distancing during the pandemic. The magnitude of the declines in gross domestic product and employment in the spring was unprecedented. Since then, economic activity and job growth have begun to recover as parts of the economy reopened, bolstered by the initial dissemination of vaccines and government stimulus, but remain well below pre-pandemic levels. The 10-year treasury yield trended down throughout the year fluctuating from 0.5% to 1.9% and ending the year at 0.9%, down from 1.9% at the end of 2019. While the economy has declined overall during 2020, the industrial real estate sector has been one of the most resilient sectors during the pandemic, which has been largely driven by e-commerce demand and additional demand from suppliers to drive up safety stock. We continued to pursue quality industrial assets in coastal Tier 1 markets during 2020. We resumed speculative development projects in the second half of the year and continued to lease up the speculative space. Despite the global crisis, we were able to execute our asset and capital strategies for the year and had a successful 2020.\nThe following table shows a reconciliation of net income attributable to common shareholders or common unitholders to the calculation of funds from operations (\"FFO\") attributable to common shareholders or common unitholders for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively (in thousands):\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to common shareholders of the General Partner </td> <td>$ </td> <td>299,915 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>428,972 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>383,729 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add back: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests - common limited partnership interests in the Partnership </td> <td>2,663 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,678 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,528 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to common unitholders of the Partnership </td> <td>302,578 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>432,650 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>387,257 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>353,013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>327,223 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>312,217 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Company share of unconsolidated joint venture depreciation and amortization </td> <td>9,265 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,083 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,146 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Partnership share of gains on property sales </td> <td>(127,811) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(235,098) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(208,780) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gains on land sales </td> <td>(10,458) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,445) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,334) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (benefit) expense not allocable to FFO </td> <td>(5,112) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,686 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,828 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment charges </td> <td>5,626 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gains on sales of real estate assets-share of unconsolidated joint ventures </td> <td>(822) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21,239) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,094) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Impairment charges - unconsolidated joint venture </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,214 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO attributable to common unitholders of the Partnership (1) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>526,279 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>514,860 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>488,454 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Additional General Partner Adjustments: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests - common limited partnership interests in the Partnership </td> <td>(2,663) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,678) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,528) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Noncontrolling interest share of adjustments </td> <td>(1,979) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(702) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(923) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO attributable to common shareholders of the General Partner (1) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>521,637 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>510,480 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>484,003 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) FFO is a non-GAAP measure used in the real estate industry and is computed in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"). NAREIT FFO is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental operating performance measure of a REIT. NAREIT FFO is calculated as net income attributable to the common shareholders of the General Partner in accordance with GAAP excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains and losses on sales of real estate assets (including real estate assets incidental to our business), gains and losses from change in control, impairment charges related to real estate assets (including real estate assets incidental to our business) and similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, all net of related taxes.\nThe most comparable GAAP measure to NAREIT FFO is net income attributable to common shareholders or common unitholders. Management believes it is a useful indicator of consolidated operating performance, which improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public, makes comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful and enables investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the long-term assets that form the core of a REIT's activity.\nNet income attributable to the common shareholders of the General Partner for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $299.9 million, compared to net income of $429.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net income attributable to the common unitholders of the Partnership for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $302.6\nmillion, compared to net income of $432.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in net income in 2020 for the General Partner and the Partnership, when compared to 2019, was primarily the result of lower gains on property sales and higher losses on debt extinguishment during 2020.\nNAREIT FFO attributable to common shareholders of the General Partner totaled $521.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $510.5 million for 2019. NAREIT FFO attributable to common unitholders of the Partnership totaled $526.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $514.9 million for 2019. The increase to NAREIT FFO from 2019 for the General Partner and the Partnership was primarily driven by improved occupancy, rental rate growth and new developments being placed into service and leased up, partially offset by debt extinguishment costs recognized during 2020.\nIn accordance with our strategic plan, we continue to increase our investment in high-quality industrial properties, with build-to-suit developments across all of our markets and most of our speculative development focused in the markets we believe have the best long-term growth potential. Additionally, we continued to maintain high occupancy levels through 2020 and quickly lease a significant portion of our speculative development projects. Highlights of our 2020 strategic and operational activities are as follows:\n\u2022We generated $336.3 million of total net cash proceeds from the disposition of seven consolidated buildings and 157 acres of wholly owned undeveloped land.\n\u2022We acquired ten industrial properties during the year ended December 31, 2020 with a total asset value of $424.9 million.\n\u2022We started new development projects with expected total costs of $795.6 million, which included $78.0 million of expected total costs for development projects started within two unconsolidated joint ventures. The development projects started in 2020 were, in aggregate, 62.0% leased at December 31, 2020.\n\u2022We placed 18 newly completed consolidated development projects in service, which totaled 6.8 million square feet with total costs of $693.8 million at December 31, 2020. These properties were 93.7% leased at December 31, 2020. Two newly completed projects owned by unconsolidated joint ventures were also placed in service, totaling 491,000 square feet with total costs of $27.6 million (square feet and costs shown at 100%), during 2020. These properties were 100% leased at December 31, 2020.\n\u2022The total estimated cost of our properties under construction at December 31, 2020, with costs for unconsolidated properties shown at 100%, totaled $1.10 billion, with $690.1 million of such costs already incurred. The total estimated cost for the one unconsolidated joint venture property under construction at December 31, 2020 was $57.0 million, with $22.6 million of such costs already incurred. The consolidated properties under construction were 64.5% pre-leased, while the unconsolidated joint venture property under construction was 100% pre-leased.\n\u2022Income from continuing operations before income taxes was $297.5 million and $440.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\u2022Same-property net operating income, on a cash basis, as defined hereafter under \"Supplemental Performance Measures\", increased by 5.0% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019.\n\u2022As the result of leasing up space in speculative developments throughout 2020, the percentage of total square feet leased for our in-service portfolio of consolidated properties increased from 96.6% at December 31, 2019 to 97.4% at December 31, 2020.\n\u2022Total leasing activity for our consolidated properties totaled 25.5 million square feet in 2020 compared to 28.7 million square feet in 2019.\n\u2022Total leasing activity for our consolidated and unconsolidated joint venture properties in 2020 included 6.1 million and 1.1 million, respectively, square feet of lease renewals (excludes early renewals and short term renewals), which represented 65.6% and 86.8%, respectively, retention rates on a square foot basis. New\nsecond generation and renewal leases, on a combined basis, executed for consolidated and unconsolidated joint venture properties during the year resulted in 28.2% and 33.8%, respectively, increases to net effective rents (\"net effective rents\" is defined hereafter in the \"Key Performance Indicators\" section) when compared to the previous leases of the same space.\nWe utilized the capital generated from dispositions during the year to reduce debt and to fund our development activities. Highlights of our key financing activities are as follows:\n\u2022During 2020, the General Partner issued 4.6 million common shares under its at the market (\"ATM\") equity program, generating gross proceeds of $177.1 million and, after deducting commissions and other costs, net proceeds of $175.0 million.\n\u2022In February 2020, we issued $325.0 million of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at a stated interest rate of 3.05%, have an effective interest rate of 3.19%, and mature on March 1, 2050. Proceeds from the unsecured notes offering were primarily used to repay the $300.0 million of senior unsecured notes bearing a stated interest rate of 4.38% and with a scheduled maturity of 2022. In connection with the early redemption of these notes, we recognized a loss of $17.8 million consisting of a prepayment premium and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.\n\u2022In June 2020, we issued $350.0 million of senior unsecured notes, which bear interest at a stated interest rate of 1.75%, have an effective interest rate of 1.85% and mature on July 1, 2030. Proceeds from the unsecured notes offering were primarily used to repurchase and cancel $216.3 million of 3.88% senior unsecured notes due 2022 pursuant to a tender offer completed by the Partnership in June 2020. In connection with the early cancellation of these notes, we recognized a loss of $15.1 million consisting of a prepayment premium and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.\n\u2022During 2020, we repaid one fixed rate secured loan, totaling $9.0 million, which had a stated interest rate of 5.61%.\nCOVID-19\nDuring 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have made various changes to our operations in order to support the health and safety of our associates and the communities in which we operate. Throughout the pandemic, accelerated e-commerce demand drove strong leasing activity, while the pandemic also negatively impacted a relatively small portion of our tenant base that operate in lines of business, such as event planning, that were most acutely impacted by COVID-19. Through December 31, 2020, we executed deferral agreements with certain customers that allowed for $7.4 million of total scheduled rental payments to be deferred and repaid in future periods. The substantial majority of these agreements were short term in nature and required repayment of the deferred amounts within twelve months of their execution. We have collected all amounts due under such short term rent deferral agreements through the end of 2020. We temporarily paused our acquisition, disposition and development activities at the onset of the pandemic but such activities were resumed at an accelerated pace during the second half of the year.\nThe pandemic's impact on the overall global economy is continuing and the ultimate impact cannot be predicted at this time. Please see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" for additional information about the potential impacts the pandemic may have on our business and results of operations.\nSupplemental Performance Measures\nIn addition to NAREIT FFO we use (i) Property Level Net Operating Income - Cash Basis (\"PNOI\") and (ii) Same-Property Net Operating Income - Cash Basis (\"SPNOI\") as supplemental non-GAAP performance measures. Management believes that the use of PNOI and SPNOI combined with net income (which remains the primary measure of performance), improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and makes comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. The most comparable GAAP measure to PNOI and SPNOI is income from continuing operations before income taxes.\nPNOI and SPNOI each exclude expenses that materially impact our overall results of operations and, therefore, should not be considered as a substitute for income from continuing operations before income taxes, or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Furthermore, these metrics may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nProperty Level Net Operating Income - Cash Basis\nPNOI is comprised of rental revenues from continuing operations less rental expenses and real estate taxes from continuing operations, along with certain other adjusting items. As a performance metric that consists of only the cash-based revenues and expenses directly related to ongoing real estate rental operations, PNOI is narrower in scope than NAREIT FFO.\nPNOI, as we calculate it, may not be directly comparable to similarly titled, but differently calculated, measures for other REITs. We believe that PNOI is another useful supplemental performance measure, as it is an input in many REIT valuation models and it provides a means by which to evaluate the performance of the properties within our Rental Operations segments. The operations of our industrial properties, as well as our non-reportable Rental Operations (our residual non-industrial properties that have not yet been sold, referred to throughout as \"non-reportable\"), are collectively referred to as \"Rental Operations.\"\nThe major factors influencing PNOI are occupancy levels, acquisitions and sales, development properties that achieve stabilized operations, rental rate increases or decreases, and the recoverability of operating expenses.\nNote 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report shows a calculation of our PNOI for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 and provides a reconciliation of PNOI for our Rental Operations segments to income from continuing operations before income taxes.\nSame-Property Net Operating Income - Cash Basis\nWe also evaluate the performance of our properties, including our share of properties we jointly control, on a \"same-property\" basis, using a metric referred to as SPNOI. We view SPNOI as a useful supplemental performance measure because it improves comparability between periods by eliminating the effects of changes in the composition of our portfolio.\nOn an individual property basis, SPNOI is generally computed in a consistent manner as PNOI.\nWe define our \"same-property\" population once a year at the beginning of the current calendar year and include buildings that were stabilized (the term \"stabilized\" means properties that have reached 90% leased or that have been in-service for at least one year since development completion or acquisition) as of January 1 of the prior calendar year. The \"same-property\" pool is also adjusted to remove properties that were sold subsequent to the beginning of the current calendar year. As such, the \"same-property\" population for the period ended December 31, 2020 includes all properties that we owned or jointly controlled at January 1, 2020, which had both been owned or jointly controlled and had reached stabilization by January 1, 2019, and have not been sold.\nA reconciliation of income from continuing operations before income taxes to SPNOI is presented as follows (in thousands, except percentage data):\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Three Months Ended December 31, </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31, </td> <td>Percent </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from continuing operations before income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>166,418 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89,664 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>297,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>440,885 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Share of SPNOI from unconsolidated joint ventures </td> <td> </td> <td>4,868 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,661 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> PNOI excluded from the \"same-property\" population </td> <td> </td> <td>(26,785) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11,333) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(71,160) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(33,395) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Earnings from Service Operations </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,218) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(937) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,028) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,360) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Rental Operations revenues and expenses excluded from PNOI </td> <td> </td> <td>(14,924) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11,778) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(44,002) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(57,546) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Non-Segment Items </td> <td> </td> <td>24,133 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77,337 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>410,541 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>215,218 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SPNOI </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>152,492 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>147,614 </td> <td> </td> <td>3.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>605,995 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>577,016 </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe composition of the line items titled \"Rental Operations revenues and expenses excluded from PNOI\" and \"Non-Segment Items\" from the table above are shown in greater detail in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report.\nWe believe that the factors that impact SPNOI are generally the same as those that impact PNOI.

The following discussion highlights the metrics that drive the performance of our Rental Operations, which management uses to operate the business, and that we consider to be critical drivers of future revenues.\nOccupancy Analysis\nOccupancy is an important metric for management and our investors for understanding our financial performance.

It is difficult to predict which markets may present acquisition opportunities that align with our strategy. Because of the numerous factors considered in our acquisition decisions, we do not establish specific target yields for future acquisitions.\nWe acquired ten buildings during the year ended December 31, 2020 and six buildings during the year ended December 31, 2019.

Dispositions of properties is a source of capital to fund future investment.\nWe sold seven consolidated buildings during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 28 consolidated buildings during the year ended December 31, 2019.

the increase in rental and related revenue from continuing operations were:\n\u2022We acquired 16 properties and placed 36 wholly owned developments in service from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020, which provided incremental revenues from continuing operations of $66.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to 2019.\n\u2022Increased occupancy and rental rates within our \"same-property\" portfolio, as well as the lease up of properties that were placed in service prior to January 1, 2019 but were not in the \"same-property\" portfolio, also contributed to the increase to rental and related revenue from continuing operations.\n\u2022The increase in rental revenue included a $17.3 million increase in expense recoveries primarily related to higher recoverable real estate taxes compared to 2019.\n\u2022The sale of 35 in-service properties since January 1, 2019, which did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations, resulted in a decrease of $23.3 million to rental and related revenue from continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 2019, which partially offset the aforementioned increases to rental and related revenue from continuing operations.\n\u2022The increase in rental revenue was also partially offset by a $4.0 million increase in collectability reserves for contractual and straight-line receivables, primarily as a result of current economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.\nRental Expenses and Real Estate Taxes\nThe following table sets forth rental expenses and real estate taxes from continuing operations (in thousands):\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

continuing operations increased by $1.1 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase to rental expenses was primarily the result of acquisitions and developments placed in service from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020, partially offset by the impact of property sales that did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations and decreased recoverable snow removal costs in 2020 compared to 2019.\nOverall, real estate tax expense from continuing operations increased by $19.8 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase to real estate taxes was mainly the result of acquisitions and developments placed in service from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020, which have generally been concentrated in markets with higher tax rates and/or assessed values, and increased tax assessments in certain of our markets. These increases were partially offset by the impact of property sales that did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.\nService Operations\nThe following table sets forth the components of net earnings from the Service Operations reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively (in thousands):\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service Operations: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General contractor and service fee revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64,004 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>117,926 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General contractor and other services expenses </td> <td>(57,976) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(111,566) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earnings from Service Operations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,028 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,360 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nService Operations primarily consist of the development, construction management and general contractor services, leasing, property management and asset management for unconsolidated joint venture properties and properties owned by third parties. Service Operations are heavily influenced by the current state of the economy, as construction and development services rely on the expansion of business operations of third-party property owners and joint venture partners, while leasing and property management fees are dependent upon occupancy.\nGeneral contractor and service fee revenue, and general contractor and other service expenses, decreased as the result of lower third party construction volume during 2020.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense from continuing operations was $353.0 million and $327.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily the result of continued growth in our portfolio through development and acquisitions placed in service from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020, partially offset by the impact of property sales that did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.\nEquity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures represents our ownership share of net income from investments in unconsolidated joint ventures that generally own and operate rental properties. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures was $11.9 million and $31.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2019, we recorded equity in earnings of $19.4 million related to our share of the gain on sale of five unconsolidated joint venture buildings and equity in earnings of $1.3 million representing our share of gains on involuntary conversion from insurance recoveries related to storm damage in one unconsolidated joint venture.\nThere were no property sales by unconsolidated joint ventures during 2020.\nGain on Sale of Properties - Continuing Operations\nWe sold seven properties during 2020 that were classified in continuing operations, recognizing total gains on sale of $127.7 million. These properties did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.\nWe sold 28 properties during 2019 that were classified in continuing operations, recognizing total gains on sale of $234.7 million. These properties did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.\nGain on Sale of Land\nGains on sale of land totaled $10.5 million and $7.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We sold 157 acres of undeveloped land in 2020 compared to 110 acres of undeveloped land in 2019.\nImpairment Charges\nWe recognized $5.6 million of impairment charges during the first quarter of 2020, related to writing off pre-acquisition costs, primarily non-refundable purchase deposits, for certain planned purchases of undeveloped land that we elected not to pursue due to the uncertain economic outlook at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe did not recognize any impairment charges in 2019.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist of two components. The first component includes general corporate expenses, and the second component represents the indirect operating costs not allocated to, or absorbed by, either the development, leasing and operation of our consolidated properties or our Service Operations. Such indirect operating costs are primarily comprised of employee compensation, including related costs such as benefits and wage-related taxes, but also include other ancillary costs such as travel and information technology support. Total indirect operating costs, prior to any allocation or absorption, and general corporate expenses are collectively referred to as our overall pool of overhead costs.\nThose indirect costs not allocated to or absorbed by these operations are charged to general and administrative expenses. We regularly review our total overhead cost structure relative to our leasing, development and construction volume and adjust the level of total overhead, generally through changes in our level of staffing in various functional departments, as necessary, in order to control overall general and administrative expense.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $62.4 million and $60.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The following table sets forth the factors that led to the increase in general and administrative expenses from 2019 to 2020 (in millions):\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses - 2019 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease to overall pool of overhead costs </td> <td>(3.5) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Overhead restructuring charges (1) </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of increased allocation of costs to leasing and development activities (2) </td> <td>(4.1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decreased allocation of costs to Service Operations and Rental Operations (3) </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses - 2020 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) We recognized approximately $4.5 million of overhead restructuring charges included within general and administrative expenses. These charges primarily related to benefits provided to certain associates that terminated employment either as part of a voluntary retirement package offered to certain eligible employees during 2020 or in connection with other organizational changes.\n(2) We capitalized $6.5 million and $28.8 million of our total overhead costs to leasing and development, respectively, for consolidated properties during 2020, compared to capitalizing $6.8 million and $24.2 million of such costs, respectively, for 2019. Non-capitalizable leasing costs were $12.3 million and $12.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (these costs are presented separately in the line item \"Non-Incremental Costs Related to Successful Leases\" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations). Combined overhead costs capitalized to leasing and development totaled 26.7% and 22.8% of our overall pool of overhead costs for 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(3) The decrease in allocation of costs to Service Operations and Rental Operations resulted from a lower volume of third-party construction projects during 2020.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense allocable to continuing operations was $93.4 million and $89.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in interest expense from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was largely the result of increased overall borrowings and lower capitalization of interest expense, partially offset by lower average interest rates during 2020 as the result of refinancing certain of our unsecured notes.\nWe capitalized $24.3 million and $26.5 million of interest costs during 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nDebt Extinguishment\nDuring 2020, we redeemed $300.0 million of unsecured notes with a stated interest rate of 4.38% and repurchased and canceled $216.3 million of unsecured notes with a stated interest rate of 3.88% pursuant to a tender offer completed by the Partnership. In connection with redemption and repurchase of these unsecured notes, we recognized a total loss of $32.9 million including the redemption/repayment premium and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.\nDuring 2019, we redeemed $250.0 million of unsecured notes, which had a stated interest rate of 3.88%. We recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $6.3 million, which included a prepayment premium and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Certain estimates, judgments and assumptions are inherently subjective and based on the existing business and market conditions, and are therefore continually evaluated based upon available information and experience. Based on the nature of our business, current economic conditions and the value of our real estate assets, we have concluded that our financial statements for all periods presented have not been materially impacted by individual accounts or classes of transaction that rely on estimates. Further, we have concluded that our financial statements for all periods presented are not materially impacted by estimates of fair value that rely upon non-observable inputs.\nWe have determined that judgments regarding the impairment of real estate assets represent a critical accounting estimate that has the potential to be material in future periods and has been material in certain periods prior to those presented in this Form 10-K. As the result of the strong demand, and generally appreciating values, for industrial real estate assets, we have not recognized any material impairment charges in any of the periods presented in our consolidated financial statements. As described below in our description of Critical Accounting Policies, determining whether a triggering event has taken place requires an evaluation of assumptions including occupancy levels, rental rates, capitalization rates and anticipated holding periods when evaluating real estate assets for potential impairment. We do not believe that the conclusions we reached regarding the assessment of our real estate assets for impairment, in the current economic and operating environment, would result in a materially different conclusion within any reasonable range of assumptions that could have been applied. Should economic conditions worsen, and the values of industrial assets decline in future periods, then the assumptions and estimates we may make in future impairment analyses, and potential future measurement of impairment charges, could be sensitive and could result in a material change in the range of potential outcomes.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nNote 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies. Our management has assessed the accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements and discussed them with our audit committee and independent auditors. The following accounting policies are considered critical based upon materiality to the financial statements, and to a lesser extent, the degree of judgment involved in estimating reported amounts and sensitivity to changes in industry and economic conditions:\nCost Capitalization: Direct and certain indirect costs, including interest, clearly associated with the development, construction or expansion of real estate investments are capitalized as a cost of the property.\nWe capitalize interest and direct and indirect project costs associated with the initial construction of a property up to the time the property is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. We capitalize all such costs through the completion of the building shell. The interest rate used to capitalize interest is based upon our average borrowing rate on existing debt.\nWe also capitalize direct and indirect costs, including interest costs, on vacant space during extended lease-up periods, after construction of the building shell has been completed, if costs are being incurred to ready the vacant space for its intended use. If costs and activities incurred to ready the vacant space cease, then cost capitalization is also discontinued until such activities are resumed. Once necessary work has been completed on a vacant space, project costs are no longer capitalized. We cease capitalization of all project costs on extended lease-up periods after the shorter of a one-year period after the completion of the building shell or when the property attains 90% occupancy.\nIn assessing the amount of indirect costs to be capitalized, we first allocate payroll costs, on a department-by-department basis, among activities for which capitalization is warranted (i.e., construction and development and leasing) and those for which capitalization is not warranted (i.e., property management, maintenance, acquisitions, dispositions, non-incremental leasing costs and general corporate functions). To the extent the employees of a department split their time between capitalizable and non-capitalizable activities, the allocations are made based on estimates of the actual amount of time spent in each activity. Once the payroll costs are allocated, the non-payroll costs of each department are allocated among the capitalizable and non-capitalizable activities in the same proportion as payroll costs.\nTo ensure that an appropriate amount of costs are capitalized, the amount of capitalized construction and development costs that are allocated to a specific project are limited to amounts using standards we developed. These standards are based on a percentage of the total development costs of a project. These standards are derived after considering the amounts that would be allocated if the personnel in the departments were working at full capacity. The use of these standards ensures that overhead costs attributable to downtime or to unsuccessful projects are not capitalized. Additionally, only internal leasing costs that are incremental, which are comprised of success-based leasing payments to our in-house leasing personnel, are capitalized.\nImpairment of Real Estate Assets: We evaluate our real estate assets, with the exception of those that are classified as held-for-sale, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If such an evaluation is considered necessary, we compare the carrying amount of that real estate asset, or asset group, with the expected undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with, and that are expected to arise as a direct result of, the use and eventual disposition of that asset, or asset group. Our estimate of the expected future cash flows used in testing for impairment is based on, among other things, our estimates regarding future market conditions, rental rates, occupancy levels, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other tenant concessions, assumptions regarding the residual value of our properties at the end of our anticipated holding period and the length of our anticipated holding period and is, therefore, subjective by nature. These assumptions could differ materially from actual results. If our strategy changes or if market conditions otherwise dictate a reduction in the holding period and an earlier sale date, an impairment loss could be recognized and such loss could be material. To the extent the carrying amount of a real estate asset, or asset group, exceeds the associated estimate of undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its fair value.\nThe determination of the fair value of real estate assets is also highly subjective, especially in markets where there is a lack of recent comparable transactions. We primarily utilize the income approach to estimate the fair value of our income producing real estate assets. To the extent that the assumptions used in testing long-lived assets for impairment differ from those of a marketplace participant, the assumptions are modified in order to estimate the fair value of a real estate asset when an impairment charge is measured. In addition to determining future cash flows, which make the estimation of a real estate asset's undiscounted cash flows highly subjective, the selection of the discount rate and exit capitalization rate used in applying the income approach is also highly subjective.\nTo the extent applicable marketplace data is available, we generally use the market approach in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land that is determined to be impaired.\nReal estate assets that are classified as held-for-sale are reported at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value, less estimated costs to sell.\nAcquisition of Real Estate Property and Related Assets: We generally account for real estate acquisitions as asset acquisitions as opposed to business combinations. We allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identified intangible assets based on their relative fair values, using all pertinent information available at the date of acquisition. The allocation of the purchase price to tangible assets (buildings, tenant improvements and land) is based upon management's determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant. This as-if vacant\u201d value is estimated using an income, or discounted cash flow, approach that relies upon internally determined assumptions that we believe are consistent with current market conditions for similar properties. The most important assumptions in determining the allocation of the purchase price to tangible assets are the exit capitalization rate, estimated market rents and the fair value of the underlying land.\nThe purchase price of real estate assets is also allocated to intangible assets consisting of the above or below market component of in-place leases and the value of in-place leases. The value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in-place lease is determined based upon the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be received pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and (ii) management's estimate of the amounts that would be received using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease. The amounts allocated to above market leases are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and below market leases are included in other liabilities in the balance sheet; both are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. Factors considered in determining the value allocable to in-place leases include estimates, during hypothetical lease up periods, related to space that is actually leased at the time of acquisition. These estimates include (i) lost rent at market rates, (ii) fixed operating costs that will be recovered from tenants and (iii) theoretical leasing commissions required to execute similar leases. These intangible assets are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and are amortized over the remaining term of the existing lease.\nThe audit committee has reviewed the critical accounting policies identified by management.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nWe expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements over the next 12 months, which include payments of dividends and distributions, completion of development projects that are currently under construction and the capital expenditures needed to maintain our current real estate assets, through working capital, net cash provided by operating activities and short term borrowings on the Partnership's unsecured line of credit. We had $295.0 million outstanding borrowings on the Partnership's $1.20 billion unsecured line of credit, had $6.3 million of cash on hand and held $47.7 million of restricted cash in escrow for future like kind exchange transactions at December 31, 2020.\nIn addition to our existing sources of liquidity, we expect to meet long-term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled mortgage and unsecured debt maturities, financing of development activities, acquisitions and other capital improvements, through multiple sources of capital including operating cash flow, proceeds from property dispositions and accessing the public debt and equity markets.\nSources of Liquidity\nRental Operations\nCash flows from Rental Operations is our primary source of liquidity and provides a stable source of cash flow to fund operational expenses. We believe that this cash-based revenue stream is substantially aligned with revenue recognition (except for items such as periodic straight-line rental income accruals and amortization of above or below market rents) as cash receipts from the leasing of rental properties are generally received in advance of, or a short time following, the actual revenue recognition.\nWe are subject to a number of risks, which have intensified as the result of the COVID-19 outbreak, related to general economic conditions, including reduced occupancy, tenant defaults and bankruptcies and potential reduction in rental rates upon renewal or re-letting of properties, any of which would result in reduced cash flow from operations.\nDebt and Equity Securities\nOur unsecured line of credit at December 31, 2020 is described as follows (in thousands):\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Description </td> <td>Borrowing\nCapacity </td> <td> </td> <td>Maturity\nDate </td> <td> </td> <td>Outstanding Balance at December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured Line of Credit - Partnership </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,200,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>January 30, 2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>295,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Partnership's unsecured line of credit has a borrowing capacity of $1.20 billion, with an interest rate on borrowings of LIBOR plus 0.875% (equal to 1.03% for our outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2020) and a maturity date of January 30, 2022, with options to extend until January 30, 2023. Subject to certain conditions, the terms also include an option to increase the facility by up to an additional $800.0 million, for a total of up to $2.00 billion. This line of credit provides us with an option to obtain borrowings from financial institutions that participate in the line at rates that may be lower than the stated interest rate, subject to certain restrictions.\nThis line of credit contains financial covenants that require us to meet certain financial ratios and defined levels of performance, including those related to fixed charge coverage, unsecured interest expense coverage and debt-to-asset value (with asset value being defined in the Partnership's unsecured line of credit agreement). At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all covenants under this line of credit.\nThe Partnership's unsecured line of credit has an interest rate that is indexed to LIBOR. In 2017, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\"ARRC\") proposed that the Secured Overnight Funding Rate (\"SOFR\") replace LIBOR. ARRC also proposed that the transition to SOFR from LIBOR take place by the end of 2021. As the Partnership's unsecured line of credit agreement has provisions that allow for automatic transition to a new rate and the Partnership has no other material debt arrangements that are indexed to LIBOR, we believe that the transition will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had on file with the SEC an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 relating to the offer and sale, from time to time, of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities (including guarantees of the Partnership's debt securities by the General Partner). Equity securities are offered and sold by the General Partner, and the net proceeds of such offerings are contributed to the Partnership in exchange for additional General Partner Units or Preferred Units. From time to time, we expect to issue additional securities under this automatic shelf registration statement to fund the repayment of debt, to fund development and future acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes.\nThe General Partner has an ATM equity program that allows it to issue new common shares from time to time, with an aggregate offering price of up to $400.0 million. During the three months ended December 31, 2020, the General Partner issued 1.7 million common shares under its ATM equity program, resulting in net proceeds of $65.9 million after paying total compensation of $666,000 to the applicable sales agents. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the General Partner issued 4.6 million common shares under its ATM equity program, generating net proceeds of $175.0 million after paying total compensation of $1.8 million to the applicable sales agents. Other fees related to these issuances, totaling $344,000, were also paid during the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the ATM equity program still had $13.4 million worth of new common shares available to issue.\nIn February 2020, a consolidated joint venture obtained an $18.4 million secured loan from a third party financial institution, with a fixed annual interest rate of 3.41% and a maturity date of March 1, 2035.\nAlso in February 2020, we issued $325.0 million of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at a stated interest rate of 3.05%, have an effective interest of 3.19%, and mature on March 1, 2050, for gross proceeds of $316.4 million.\nIn June 2020, we issued $350.0 million of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at a stated interest rate of 1.75%, have an effective interest of 1.85%, and mature on July 1, 2030, for gross proceeds of $346.8 million.\nThe Partnership has issued debt securities pursuant to certain indentures and related supplemental indentures, which also require us to comply with financial ratios and other covenants regarding our operations. We were in compliance with all such covenants at December 31, 2020.\nSale of Real Estate Assets\nWe regularly work to identify, consider and pursue opportunities to dispose of properties in a manner that is generally consistent with our strategic plans. Our ability to dispose of such properties on favorable terms, or at all, is dependent upon a number of factors including the availability of credit to potential buyers to purchase properties at prices that we consider acceptable. Although we believe that we have demonstrated our ability to generate significant liquidity through the disposition of non-strategic properties, potential future adverse changes to general market and economic conditions, including the uncertain economic outlook caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, could negatively impact our further ability to dispose of such properties.\nSales of land and properties provided $336.3 million in net proceeds in 2020, compared to $432.7 million in 2019 and $511.4 million in 2018.\nTransactions with Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\nTransactions with unconsolidated joint ventures also provide a source of liquidity. From time to time we will sell properties to unconsolidated joint ventures, while retaining a continuing interest in that entity, and receive proceeds commensurate to those interests that we do not own. Additionally, unconsolidated joint ventures will from time to time obtain debt financing or sell properties and will then distribute to us, and our joint venture partners, all or a portion of the proceeds from such transactions. There were no material transactions with unconsolidated joint ventures in 2020.\nUses of Liquidity\nOur principal uses of liquidity include the following:\n\u2022property investment;\n\u2022leasing/capital costs;\n\u2022dividends and distributions to shareholders and unitholders;\n\u2022debt service and maturities;\n\u2022opportunistic repurchases of outstanding debt; and\n\u2022other contractual obligations.\nProperty Investment\nOur overall strategy is to continue to increase our investment in quality industrial properties, primarily through development, on both a speculative and build-to-suit basis, supplemented with acquisitions in higher barrier markets with the highest growth potential. Pursuant to this strategy, we evaluate development and acquisition opportunities based upon our market outlook, including general economic conditions, supply and long-term growth potential. Our ability to make future property investments is dependent upon identifying suitable acquisition and development opportunities, and our continued access to our longer-term sources of liquidity, including issuances of debt or equity securities as well as generating cash flow by disposing of selected properties.\nLeasing/Capital Costs\nTenant improvements and lease-related costs pertaining to our initial leasing of newly completed space, or vacant space in acquired properties, are referred to as first generation expenditures. Such first generation expenditures for tenant improvements are included within \"development of real estate investments\" in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, while such expenditures for capitalizable lease-related costs are included within \"other deferred leasing costs.\"\nCash expenditures related to the construction of a building's shell, as well as the associated site improvements, are also included within \"development of real estate investments\" in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nTenant improvements and leasing costs to renew or re-let rental space that we previously leased to tenants for second generation leases are referred to as second generation expenditures. Building improvements that are not specific to any tenant, but serve to improve integral components of our real estate properties, are also second generation expenditures. One of the principal uses of our liquidity is to fund the second generation leasing/capital expenditures of our real estate investments.\nThe following table summarizes our second generation capital expenditures by type of expenditure, as well as capital expenditures for the development of real estate investments and for other deferred leasing costs (in thousands):\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second generation tenant improvements </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,165 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,797 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second generation leasing costs </td> <td>19,870 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,899 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Building improvements </td> <td>4,103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,505 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,778 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total second generation capital expenditures </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,099 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,549 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,474 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Development of real estate investments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>573,544 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>446,801 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>577,383 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other deferred leasing costs </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,545 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,509 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,380 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe had consolidated properties under development with an expected total cost of $1.04 billion at December 31, 2020, compared to projects with an expected cost of $1.05 billion and $709.7 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We had $374.9 million of remaining costs to complete for consolidated properties under development at December 31, 2020.\nThe capital expenditures in the table above include the capitalization of internal overhead costs. We capitalized $6.5 million, $6.8 million and $19.0 million of overhead costs that are incremental to executing leases, including both first and second generation leases, during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We capitalized $28.8 million, $24.2 million and $29.8 million of overhead costs related to development activities, including both development and tenant improvement projects on first and second generation space, during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Combined overhead costs capitalized to leasing and development totaled 26.7%, 22.8% and 35.1% of our overall pool of overhead costs at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in the overhead costs capitalized to leasing for 2020 and 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to the expense impact of internal costs related to successful leasing which were not capitalizable as a result of the adoption of the new lease standard on January 1, 2019 (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report) and was included in the line item \"Non-incremental costs related to successful leases\" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for 2020 and 2019.\nFurther discussion of the capitalization of overhead costs can be found in the year-to-year comparison of general and administrative expenses and Critical Accounting Policies sections of this Item 7.\nIn addition to the capitalization of overhead costs, the totals for development of real estate assets in the table above include the capitalization of $24.3 million, $26.5 million and $27.2 million of interest costs in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nBoth our first and second generation expenditures vary significantly between leases on a per square foot basis, dependent upon several factors including the nature of a tenant's operations, the specific physical characteristics of each individual property and the market in which the property is located.\nDividend and Distribution Requirements\nThe General Partner is required to meet the distribution requirements of the Code in order to maintain its REIT status. We paid regular dividends or distributions of $0.96, $0.88 and $0.815 per common share or Common Unit for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe expect to continue to distribute at least an amount equal to our taxable earnings, to meet the requirements to maintain the General Partner's REIT status, and additional amounts as determined by the General Partner's board of directors. Distributions are declared at the discretion of the General Partner's board of directors and are subject to actual cash available for distribution, our financial condition, capital requirements and such other factors as the General Partner's board of directors deems relevant.\nDebt Service and Maturities\nDebt outstanding at December 31, 2020 had a face value totaling $3.41 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 3.17% and maturities at various dates through 2050. Of this total amount, we had $3.06 billion of unsecured debt, $60.6 million of secured debt and $295.0 million outstanding borrowings on our unsecured line of credit at December 31, 2020. Scheduled principal amortization, maturities and early repayments of such debt totaled $529.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe following table is a summary of the scheduled future amortization and maturities of our indebtedness at December 31, 2020 (in thousands, except percentage data):\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Future Repayments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year </td> <td>Scheduled\nAmortization </td> <td> </td> <td>Maturities </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted Average\nInterest Rate of\nFuture Repayments </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,413 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,413 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.16% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022 </td> <td>4,646 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83,740 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>88,386 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.99% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2023 </td> <td>4,893 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>545,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>549,893 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.29% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2024 </td> <td>5,155 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>300,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>305,155 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.92% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2025 </td> <td>5,102 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,102 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.08% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2026 </td> <td>3,238 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>375,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>378,238 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.38% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2027 </td> <td>1,615 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>475,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>476,615 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.18% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2028 </td> <td>1,307 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>500,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>501,307 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.45% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2029 </td> <td>1,359 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>400,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>401,359 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.88% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2030 </td> <td>1,413 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>350,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>351,413 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.86% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Thereafter </td> <td>4,730 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>347,734 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>352,464 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.26% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,871 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,376,474 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,414,345 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.17% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Partnership's unsecured line of credit is reflected in the table above as maturing in January 2023, based on the ability to exercise the two six-month extension options from its stated maturity date of January 2022 (see Note 9).

Proceeds from the unsecured notes offering were initially applied to pay down outstanding borrowings on our line of credit as of December 31, 2020, and we intend to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from the offering to the financing or refinancing of eligible green projects.\nWe anticipate generating capital to fund our debt maturities by using undistributed cash generated from our Rental Operations and property dispositions and by raising additional capital from future debt or equity transactions.\nRepayments of Outstanding Debt\nTo the extent that it supports our overall capital strategy, we may purchase or redeem some of our outstanding unsecured notes prior to their stated maturities.\nIn March 2020, we redeemed $300.0 million of unsecured notes that were scheduled to mature in June 2022.\nIn June 2020, we repurchased and canceled $216.3 million of unsecured notes that were scheduled to mature in October 2022 pursuant to a tender offer completed by the Partnership.\nDuring 2020, we repaid one fixed rate secured loan of $9.0 million, which had a stated interest rate of 5.61%.\nLease Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have total future payment obligations of $225.2 million on our ground leases and $27.9 million on our office leases and other lease arrangements, over their non-cancellable lease period including applicable lease extension and renewal options when deemed reasonably certain of exercise. See Note 14 to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nGuarantee Obligations\nWe are subject to various guarantee obligations in the normal course of business and, in most cases, do not anticipate these obligations to result in significant cash payments. At December 31, 2020, we guaranteed the repayment of $81.3 million of loans associated with two of our unconsolidated joint ventures. In January 2021, we, and the other partner in one of these unconsolidated joint ventures, repaid $69.8 million of such guaranteed loans.\nAdditionally, as of December 31, 2020, we guaranteed the repayment of $20.1 million of economic development bonds issued by various municipalities in connection with certain commercial developments.\nHistorical Cash Flows\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $67.2 million, $121.4 million and $25.5 million at December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The following table highlights significant changes in net cash associated with our operating, investing and financing activities (in thousands):\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>566,436 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>505,898 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>484,407 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used for investing activities </td> <td>(856,221) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(555,074) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(594,430) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities </td> <td>235,577 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>145,090 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(58,087) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities provide the cash necessary to meet our operational requirements and the receipt of rental income from Rental Operations continues to be our primary source of operating cash flows. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities, compared to 2019, was driven by increasing our asset base through development, financed through equity or low cost debt issuances, and increasing occupancy and rental rates within our existing portfolio.\nThe increase to cash flow provided by operating activities between 2019 and 2018 was due to the timing of cash receipts and cash payments on third party construction projects as well as increased cash flows from our Rental Operations. These increases in operating cash flows were partially offset by increased cash paid for interest and income taxes as well as the timing of working capital.\nInvesting Activities\nHighlights of significant cash sources and uses are as follows:\n\u2022Real estate development costs were $573.5 million, $446.8 million and $577.4 million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\u2022We paid cash of $632.1 million, $598.4 million and $592.4 million, for real estate and undeveloped land acquisitions during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\u2022Sales of land and property generated net proceeds of $336.3 million, $432.7 million and $511.4 million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\u2022During 2020, we received repayments of $110.0 million on notes receivable from property sales, compared to $162.6 million and $154.1 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\u2022Second generation tenant improvements, leasing costs and building improvements totaled $41.1 million, $47.5 million and $53.5 million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\u2022We receive capital distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures, either as the result of selling our ownership interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures or from our share of the proceeds from property sales from unconsolidated joint ventures. In 2020, we received $876,000 in capital distributions primarily from one unconsolidated joint venture from the sale of land. We received $26.3 million in capital distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures during 2019, primarily related to the sale of three properties within three of our unconsolidated joint ventures. We received $23.1 million in capital distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures during 2018, primarily related to the sale of six properties within three of our unconsolidated joint ventures.\n\u2022We made capital contributions and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures in the amounts of $6.2 million, $34.5 million and $5.9 million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nFinancing Activities\nThe following items highlight significant capital transactions:\n\u2022During 2020, the General Partner issued 4.6 million common shares pursuant to its ATM equity programs for net proceeds of $175.0 million, compared to 8.0 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $263.3 million in 2019 and 990,400 shares of common stock for net proceeds of $28.4 million in 2018.\n\u2022We issued $675.0 million, $575.0 million and $450.0 million of senior unsecured notes during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The 2020 unsecured debt issuances consist of $325.0 million of senior unsecured notes issued in February 2020 for gross proceeds of $316.4 million and $350.0 million of senior unsecured notes issued in June 2020 for gross proceeds of $346.8 million. The 2019 unsecured debt issuances consist of $175.0 million of senior unsecured notes issued in August 2019 for gross proceeds of $182.3 million and $400.0 million of senior unsecured notes issued in November 2019 with a corresponding cash payment of $35.6 million for termination of the five forward starting interest rate swaps entered in 2018 and 2019. We issued $450.0 million of senior unsecured notes in 2018.\n\u2022During 2020, the Partnership paid cash of $547.0 million for the early redemption of $300.0 million of senior unsecured notes that were scheduled to mature in June 2022 and the early repurchase and cancellation of $216.3 million of senior unsecured notes due in October 2022. During 2019, the Partnership paid cash of $255.8 million for the early redemption of $250.0 million of senior unsecured notes that were scheduled to mature in February 2021. The Partnership repaid $7.0 million of unsecured debt in 2018.\n\u2022In February 2020, a consolidated joint venture of the Partnership obtained a secured loan from a third party financial institution for gross proceeds of $18.4 million. No secured loans were obtained in 2019 or 2018.\n\u2022The Partnership repaid one secured loan for $9.0 million during 2020, compared to repayments of three secured loans for $41.7 million in 2019 and three secured loans for $227.1 million in 2018.\n\u2022We increased net borrowings on the Partnership's unsecured line of credit by $295.0 million in 2020, decreased net borrowings by $30.0 million in 2019 and increased net borrowings by $30.0 million in 2018.\n\u2022We paid regular cash dividends or distributions of $0.96, $0.88 and $0.815 per common share or per Common Unit during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\u2022Changes in book cash overdrafts are classified as financing activities within our consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Book cash overdrafts were $16.4 million, $14.4 million and $14.3 million at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\u2022In 2019, we paid off a special assessment bond for $9.9 million, which was reflected within Other Financing Activities on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We did not make similar significant repayments during 2020 or 2018.\nImpact of Changes in Credit Ratings on Our Liquidity\nWe are currently assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes from Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's Ratings Group. Our senior unsecured notes have been assigned a rating of Baa1 by Moody's Investors Service. In addition, our senior unsecured notes have been assigned a rating of BBB+ by Standard & Poor's Ratings Group. A securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization.\nThe ratings of our senior unsecured notes could change based upon, among other things, the impact that prevailing economic conditions may have on our results of operations and financial condition. If our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, we could be required, among other things, to pay additional interest and fees on outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement. Credit rating reductions by one or more rating agencies could also adversely affect our access to funding sources, the cost and other terms of obtaining funding, as well as our overall financial condition, operating results and cash flow.\nFinancial Instruments\nWe are exposed to capital market risk, such as changes in interest rates. In order to reduce the volatility relating to interest rate risk, we may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements from time to time. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.", "item_7_truncated": "\nThe following table summarizes our properties under development at December 31, 2020 (in thousands, except percentage data):\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75,345 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>74,083 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-reportable Rental Operations and non-segment expenses </td> <td>1,294 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,501 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total rental expenses from continuing operations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>76,639 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75,584 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate taxes: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial </td> <td>$ </td> <td>148,252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>128,887 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-reportable Rental Operations and non-segment expenses </td> <td>1,043 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>633 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total real estate tax expense from continuing operations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>149,295 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>129,520 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u2022The increase in rental revenue included a $17.3 million increase in expense recoveries primarily related to higher recoverable real estate taxes compared to 2019.\nNote 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies.

New\n\u2022During 2020, we received repayments of $110.0 million on notes receivable from property sales, compared to $162.6 million and $154.1 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nTransactions with Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\nOn an individual property basis, SPNOI is generally computed in a consistent manner as PNOI.\nWe are subject to various guarantee obligations in the normal course of business and, in most cases, do not anticipate these obligations to result in significant cash payments. At December 31, 2020, we guaranteed the repayment of $81.3 million of loans associated with two of our unconsolidated joint ventures. In January 2021, we, and the other partner in one of these unconsolidated joint ventures, repaid $69.8 million of such guaranteed loans.\n\nOur strategic objectives include (i) increasing our investment in quality industrial properties through development, including facilities with sustainable design features that will meet customer needs; (ii) acquiring properties primarily in coastal Tier 1 markets which we believe provide the best potential for future rental growth; and (iii) maintaining an optimal land inventory through selected strategic land acquisitions and new development activity. We are continuing to execute our asset strategy through a disciplined approach by identifying development opportunities, identifying select acquisition targets where the asset quality and pricing meet our objectives and continually evaluating our portfolio for disposition by regularly identifying assets that no longer meet our long-term objectives.\nIn accordance with our strategic plan, we continue to increase our investment in high-quality industrial properties, with build-to-suit developments across all of our markets and most of our speculative development focused in the markets we believe have the best long-term growth potential. Additionally, we continued to maintain high occupancy levels through 2020 and quickly lease a significant portion of our speculative development projects. Highlights of our 2020 strategic and operational activities are as follows:\nThe following items highlight significant capital transactions:\nOur principal uses of liquidity include the following:\n\u2022Owned directly, or through ownership interests in unconsolidated joint ventures (with acreage not adjusted for our percentage ownership interest), approximately 1,000 acres of land and controlled approximately 800 acres through purchase options.\nWe sold seven consolidated buildings during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 28 consolidated buildings during the year ended December 31, 2019. The following table summarizes the sales prices, in-place yields and percent leased of industrial building dispositions (in thousands, except percentage data):\nThrough all of our environmental, social and governance efforts, we demonstrate that operating and developing commercial real estate can be conducted with a conscious regard for the environment and community, while also benefiting our investors, employees, tenants and the communities in which we operate.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nService Operations\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $62.4 million and $60.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The following table sets forth the factors that led to the increase in general and administrative expenses from 2019 to 2020 (in millions):\nWe capitalize interest and direct and indirect project costs associated with the initial construction of a property up to the time the property is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. We capitalize all such costs through the completion of the building shell. The interest rate used to capitalize interest is based upon our average borrowing rate on existing debt.\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for 2020 compared to 2019 is under the Results of Operations section below. Our financial condition for 2018 and results of operations for 2019 compared to 2018 can be found under Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which is incorporated herein by this reference to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 25, 2020, and is available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and the Investor Relations section of our website at www.dukerealty.com.\nFurther discussion of the capitalization of overhead costs can be found in the year-to-year comparison of general and administrative expenses and Critical Accounting Policies sections of this Item 7.\nRepayments of Outstanding Debt\nThe United States economy in 2020 experienced an unprecedented downturn as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic with the gross domestic product declining by 3.5%. The recession was caused by dramatic changes in consumer behavior linked to business shutdowns, travel restrictions, and social distancing during the pandemic. The magnitude of the declines in gross domestic product and employment in the spring was unprecedented. Since then, economic activity and job growth have begun to recover as parts of the economy reopened, bolstered by the initial dissemination of vaccines and government stimulus, but remain well below pre-pandemic levels. The 10-year treasury yield trended down throughout the year fluctuating from 0.5% to 1.9% and ending the year at 0.9%, down from 1.9% at the end of 2019. While the economy has declined overall during 2020, the industrial real estate sector has been one of the most resilient sectors during the pandemic, which has been largely driven by e-commerce demand and additional demand from suppliers to drive up safety stock. We continued to pursue quality industrial assets in coastal Tier 1 markets during 2020. We resumed speculative development projects in the second half of the year and continued to lease up the speculative space. Despite the global crisis, we were able to execute our asset and capital strategies for the year and had a successful 2020.\n\nDepreciation and Amortization\nNet income attributable to the common shareholders of the General Partner for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $299.9 million, compared to net income of $429.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net income attributable to the common unitholders of the Partnership for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $302.6\nThe following table sets forth rental and related revenue from continuing operations (in thousands):\n\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nTo the extent that it supports our overall capital strategy, we may purchase or redeem some of our outstanding unsecured notes prior to their stated maturities.\nTo ensure that an appropriate amount of costs are capitalized, the amount of capitalized construction and development costs that are allocated to a specific project are limited to amounts using standards we developed. These standards are based on a percentage of the total development costs of a project. These standards are derived after considering the amounts that would be allocated if the personnel in the departments were working at full capacity. The use of these standards ensures that overhead costs attributable to downtime or to unsuccessful projects are not capitalized. Additionally, only internal leasing costs that are incremental, which are comprised of success-based leasing payments to our in-house leasing personnel, are capitalized.\nSources of Liquidity\n\u2022In June 2020, we issued $350.0 million of senior unsecured notes, which bear interest at a stated interest rate of 1.75%, have an effective interest rate of 1.85% and mature on July 1, 2030. Proceeds from the unsecured notes offering were primarily used to repurchase and cancel $216.3 million of 3.88% senior unsecured notes due 2022 pursuant to a tender offer completed by the Partnership in June 2020. In connection with the early cancellation of these notes, we recognized a loss of $15.1 million consisting of a prepayment premium and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.\nWe also capitalize direct and indirect costs, including interest costs, on vacant space during extended lease-up periods, after construction of the building shell has been completed, if costs are being incurred to ready the vacant space for its intended use. If costs and activities incurred to ready the vacant space cease, then cost capitalization is also discontinued until such activities are resumed. Once necessary work has been completed on a vacant space, project costs are no longer capitalized. We cease capitalization of all project costs on extended lease-up periods after the shorter of a one-year period after the completion of the building shell or when the property attains 90% occupancy.\nWe did not recognize any impairment charges in 2019.\n(1) We recognized approximately $4.5 million of overhead restructuring charges included within general and administrative expenses. These charges primarily related to benefits provided to certain associates that terminated employment either as part of a voluntary retirement package offered to certain eligible employees during 2020 or in connection with other organizational changes.\nThis line of credit contains financial covenants that require us to meet certain financial ratios and defined levels of performance, including those related to fixed charge coverage, unsecured interest expense coverage and debt-to-asset value (with asset value being defined in the Partnership's unsecured line of credit agreement). At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all covenants under this line of credit.\n\n(1) FFO is a non-GAAP measure used in the real estate industry and is computed in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"). NAREIT FFO is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental operating performance measure of a REIT. NAREIT FFO is calculated as net income attributable to the common shareholders of the General Partner in accordance with GAAP excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains and losses on sales of real estate assets (including real estate assets incidental to our business), gains and losses from change in control, impairment charges related to real estate assets (including real estate assets incidental to our business) and similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, all net of related taxes.\nWe have determined that judgments regarding the impairment of real estate assets represent a critical accounting estimate that has the potential to be material in future periods and has been material in certain periods prior to those presented in this Form 10-K. As the result of the strong demand, and generally appreciating values, for industrial real estate assets, we have not recognized any material impairment charges in any of the periods presented in our consolidated financial statements. As described below in our description of Critical Accounting Policies, determining whether a triggering event has taken place requires an evaluation of assumptions including occupancy levels, rental rates, capitalization rates and anticipated holding periods when evaluating real estate assets for potential impairment. We do not believe that the conclusions we reached regarding the assessment of our real estate assets for impairment, in the current economic and operating environment, would result in a materially different conclusion within any reasonable range of assumptions that could have been applied. Should economic conditions worsen, and the values of industrial assets decline in future periods, then the assumptions and estimates we may make in future impairment analyses, and potential future measurement of impairment charges, could be sensitive and could result in a material change in the range of potential outcomes.\nCOVID-19\n\u2022Owned or jointly controlled 537 primarily industrial properties, of which 520 properties with 152.2 million square feet were in service and 17 properties with 7.4 million square feet were under development. The 520 in-service properties were comprised of 480 consolidated properties with 140.7 million square feet and 40 unconsolidated joint venture properties with 11.5 million square feet. The 17 properties under development consisted of 16 consolidated properties with 6.9 million square feet and one unconsolidated joint venture property with 517,000 square feet.\nSecond Generation Leases\nDuring 2019, we redeemed $250.0 million of unsecured notes, which had a stated interest rate of 3.88%. We recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $6.3 million, which included a prepayment premium and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.\nWe also evaluate the performance of our properties, including our share of properties we jointly control, on a \"same-property\" basis, using a metric referred to as SPNOI. We view SPNOI as a useful supplemental performance measure because it improves comparability between periods by eliminating the effects of changes in the composition of our portfolio.\nDebt and Equity Securities\n\u2022As the result of leasing up space in speculative developments throughout 2020, the percentage of total square feet leased for our in-service portfolio of consolidated properties increased from 96.6% at December 31, 2019 to 97.4% at December 31, 2020.\nThe ratings of our senior unsecured notes could change based upon, among other things, the impact that prevailing economic conditions may have on our results of operations and financial condition. If our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, we could be required, among other things, to pay additional interest and fees on outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement. Credit rating reductions by one or more rating agencies could also adversely affect our access to funding sources, the cost and other terms of obtaining funding, as well as our overall financial condition, operating results and cash flow.\nNote 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report shows a calculation of our PNOI for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 and provides a reconciliation of PNOI for our Rental Operations segments to income from continuing operations before income taxes.\nCash flows from operating activities provide the cash necessary to meet our operational requirements and the receipt of rental income from Rental Operations continues to be our primary source of operating cash flows. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities, compared to 2019, was driven by increasing our asset base through development, financed through equity or low cost debt issuances, and increasing occupancy and rental rates within our existing portfolio.\nThe following table sets forth the estimated costs of tenant improvements and leasing commissions, on a per square foot basis, that we are obligated to fulfill under the second generation industrial leases signed for our rental properties, during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\u2022Same-property net operating income, on a cash basis, as defined hereafter under \"Supplemental Performance Measures\", increased by 5.0% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019.\nHighlights of significant cash sources and uses are as follows:\nOverall, rental expenses from continuing operations increased by $1.1 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase to rental expenses was primarily the result of acquisitions and developments placed in service from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020, partially offset by the impact of property sales that did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations and decreased recoverable snow removal costs in 2020 compared to 2019.\nIn addition to the capitalization of overhead costs, the totals for development of real estate assets in the table above include the capitalization of $24.3 million, $26.5 million and $27.2 million of interest costs in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nIn addition to our existing sources of liquidity, we expect to meet long-term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled mortgage and unsecured debt maturities, financing of development activities, acquisitions and other capital improvements, through multiple sources of capital including operating cash flow, proceeds from property dispositions and accessing the public debt and equity markets.\nThe determination of the fair value of real estate assets is also highly subjective, especially in markets where there is a lack of recent comparable transactions. We primarily utilize the income approach to estimate the fair value of our income producing real estate assets. To the extent that the assumptions used in testing long-lived assets for impairment differ from those of a marketplace participant, the assumptions are modified in order to estimate the fair value of a real estate asset when an impairment charge is measured. In addition to determining future cash flows, which make the estimation of a real estate asset's undiscounted cash flows highly subjective, the selection of the discount rate and exit capitalization rate used in applying the income approach is also highly subjective.\n\nImpairment Charges\n\nOur overall strategy is to continue to increase our investment in quality industrial properties, primarily through development, on both a speculative and build-to-suit basis, supplemented with acquisitions in higher barrier markets with the highest growth potential. Pursuant to this strategy, we evaluate development and acquisition opportunities based upon our market outlook, including general economic conditions, supply and long-term growth potential. Our ability to make future property investments is dependent upon identifying suitable acquisition and development opportunities, and our continued access to our longer-term sources of liquidity, including issuances of debt or equity securities as well as generating cash flow by disposing of selected properties.\n\u2022During 2020, the Partnership paid cash of $547.0 million for the early redemption of $300.0 million of senior unsecured notes that were scheduled to mature in June 2022 and the early repurchase and cancellation of $216.3 million of senior unsecured notes due in October 2022. During 2019, the Partnership paid cash of $255.8 million for the early redemption of $250.0 million of senior unsecured notes that were scheduled to mature in February 2021. The Partnership repaid $7.0 million of unsecured debt in 2018.\nTenant improvements and leasing costs to renew or re-let rental space that we previously leased to tenants for second generation leases are referred to as second generation expenditures. Building improvements that are not specific to any tenant, but serve to improve integral components of our real estate properties, are also second generation expenditures. One of the principal uses of our liquidity is to fund the second generation leasing/capital expenditures of our real estate investments.\nWe continue to focus on maintaining a balanced and flexible capital structure which includes: (i) extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our outstanding debt obligations; (ii) borrowing primarily at fixed rates; and (iii) issuing common equity as needed to maintain appropriate leverage parameters or support significant strategic developments or acquisitions. With our successes to date and continued focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet, we expect to be in a position to be opportunistic in our investment opportunities.\nUses of Liquidity\nRental Operations\nAcquisition of Real Estate Property and Related Assets: We generally account for real estate acquisitions as asset acquisitions as opposed to business combinations. We allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identified intangible assets based on their relative fair values, using all pertinent information available at the date of acquisition. The allocation of the purchase price to tangible assets (buildings, tenant improvements and land) is based upon management's determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant. This as-if vacant\u201d value is estimated using an income, or discounted cash flow, approach that relies upon internally determined assumptions that we believe are consistent with current market conditions for similar properties. The most important assumptions in determining the allocation of the purchase price to tangible assets are the exit capitalization rate, estimated market rents and the fair value of the underlying land.\nPNOI is comprised of rental revenues from continuing operations less rental expenses and real estate taxes from continuing operations, along with certain other adjusting items. As a performance metric that consists of only the cash-based revenues and expenses directly related to ongoing real estate rental operations, PNOI is narrower in scope than NAREIT FFO.\nThe Partnership's unsecured line of credit has a borrowing capacity of $1.20 billion, with an interest rate on borrowings of LIBOR plus 0.875% (equal to 1.03% for our outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2020) and a maturity date of January 30, 2022, with options to extend until January 30, 2023. Subject to certain conditions, the terms also include an option to increase the facility by up to an additional $800.0 million, for a total of up to $2.00 billion. This line of credit provides us with an option to obtain borrowings from financial institutions that participate in the line at rates that may be lower than the stated interest rate, subject to certain restrictions.\nWe are subject to a number of risks, which have intensified as the result of the COVID-19 outbreak, related to general economic conditions, including reduced occupancy, tenant defaults and bankruptcies and potential reduction in rental rates upon renewal or re-letting of properties, any of which would result in reduced cash flow from operations.\nReal estate assets that are classified as held-for-sale are reported at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value, less estimated costs to sell.\nWe acquired ten buildings during the year ended December 31, 2020 and six buildings during the year ended December 31, 2019. The following table summarizes the acquisition price, percent leased at time of acquisition and in-place yields of industrial building acquisitions (in thousands, except percentage data):\nKey Performance Indicators\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (\"ESG\") Strategy\n\n\u2022Real estate development costs were $573.5 million, $446.8 million and $577.4 million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nGain on Sale of Land\nPNOI, as we calculate it, may not be directly comparable to similarly titled, but differently calculated, measures for other REITs. We believe that PNOI is another useful supplemental performance measure, as it is an input in many REIT valuation models and it provides a means by which to evaluate the performance of the properties within our Rental Operations segments. The operations of our industrial properties, as well as our non-reportable Rental Operations (our residual non-industrial properties that have not yet been sold, referred to throughout as \"non-reportable\"), are collectively referred to as \"Rental Operations.\"\nWe expect to generate future earnings from Rental Operations as development properties are placed in service and leased. Development activities, and our ability to lease those developments, are viewed by management as key indicators of future earnings growth and provide useful information to investors for the same reasons.\nProperty Level Net Operating Income - Cash Basis\n Topic Accounting Metric Code Our Information Energy Management Description of how building energy management considerations are integrated into property investment analysis and operational strategy IF-RE-130a.5 We integrate energy usage reduction measures on all new developments, incorporating LEED certification requirements and applicable aspects of our own sustainability policies/programs. These measures include energy modeling, high efficiency equipment (HVAC and lighting), and climate zone appropriate design factors. We have an ongoing lighting retrofit program, replacing outdated light fixtures with LED high efficiency fixtures. In 2020 we partnered with solar developers to increase the number of buildings in our portfolio with rooftop solar panels. Water Management Description of water management risks and discussion of strategies and practices to mitigate those risks IF-RE-140a.4 We integrate water reduction measures on all new developments and renovation, incorporating LEED certification or applicable aspects of our own sustainability policies/programs.

Climate Change Adaptation Area of properties located in 100-year flood zones, by property subsector IF-RE-450a.1 10.8 million square feet. \nAs of December 31, 2020, we have total future payment obligations of $225.2 million on our ground leases and $27.9 million on our office leases and other lease arrangements, over their non-cancellable lease period including applicable lease extension and renewal options when deemed reasonably certain of exercise. See Note 14 to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nThe General Partner has an ATM equity program that allows it to issue new common shares from time to time, with an aggregate offering price of up to $400.0 million. During the three months ended December 31, 2020, the General Partner issued 1.7 million common shares under its ATM equity program, resulting in net proceeds of $65.9 million after paying total compensation of $666,000 to the applicable sales agents. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the General Partner issued 4.6 million common shares under its ATM equity program, generating net proceeds of $175.0 million after paying total compensation of $1.8 million to the applicable sales agents. Other fees related to these issuances, totaling $344,000, were also paid during the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the ATM equity program still had $13.4 million worth of new common shares available to issue.\nSale of Real Estate Assets\n\u2022Income from continuing operations before income taxes was $297.5 million and $440.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(2) We capitalized $6.5 million and $28.8 million of our total overhead costs to leasing and development, respectively, for consolidated properties during 2020, compared to capitalizing $6.8 million and $24.2 million of such costs, respectively, for 2019. Non-capitalizable leasing costs were $12.3 million and $12.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (these costs are presented separately in the line item \"Non-Incremental Costs Related to Successful Leases\" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations). Combined overhead costs capitalized to leasing and development totaled 26.7% and 22.8% of our overall pool of overhead costs for 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nGeneral contractor and service fee revenue, and general contractor and other service expenses, decreased as the result of lower third party construction volume during 2020.\nHistorical Cash Flows\nThe purchase price of real estate assets is also allocated to intangible assets consisting of the above or below market component of in-place leases and the value of in-place leases. The value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in-place lease is determined based upon the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be received pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and (ii) management's estimate of the amounts that would be received using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease. The amounts allocated to above market leases are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and below market leases are included in other liabilities in the balance sheet; both are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. Factors considered in determining the value allocable to in-place leases include estimates, during hypothetical lease up periods, related to space that is actually leased at the time of acquisition. These estimates include (i) lost rent at market rates, (ii) fixed operating costs that will be recovered from tenants and (iii) theoretical leasing commissions required to execute similar leases. These intangible assets are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and are amortized over the remaining term of the existing lease.\nBuilding Dispositions\n\u2022Increased occupancy and rental rates within our \"same-property\" portfolio, as well as the lease up of properties that were placed in service prior to January 1, 2019 but were not in the \"same-property\" portfolio, also contributed to the increase to rental and related revenue from continuing operations.\nBusiness Overview\nService Operations primarily consist of the development, construction management and general contractor services, leasing, property management and asset management for unconsolidated joint venture properties and properties owned by third parties. Service Operations are heavily influenced by the current state of the economy, as construction and development services rely on the expansion of business operations of third-party property owners and joint venture partners, while leasing and property management fees are dependent upon occupancy.\nWe sold 28 properties during 2019 that were classified in continuing operations, recognizing total gains on sale of $234.7 million. These properties did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.\n\u2022We placed 18 newly completed consolidated development projects in service, which totaled 6.8 million square feet with total costs of $693.8 million at December 31, 2020. These properties were 93.7% leased at December 31, 2020. Two newly completed projects owned by unconsolidated joint ventures were also placed in service, totaling 491,000 square feet with total costs of $27.6 million (square feet and costs shown at 100%), during 2020. These properties were 100% leased at December 31, 2020.\nDuring 2020, we repaid one fixed rate secured loan of $9.0 million, which had a stated interest rate of 5.61%.\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $67.2 million, $121.4 million and $25.5 million at December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The following table highlights significant changes in net cash associated with our operating, investing and financing activities (in thousands):\n\u2022The sale of 35 in-service properties since January 1, 2019, which did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations, resulted in a decrease of $23.3 million to rental and related revenue from continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 2019, which partially offset the aforementioned increases to rental and related revenue from continuing operations.\n\u2022We acquired 16 properties and placed 36 wholly owned developments in service from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020, which provided incremental revenues from continuing operations of $66.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to 2019.\nWe utilized the capital generated from dispositions during the year to reduce debt and to fund our development activities. Highlights of our key financing activities are as follows:\nmillion, compared to net income of $432.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in net income in 2020 for the General Partner and the Partnership, when compared to 2019, was primarily the result of lower gains on property sales and higher losses on debt extinguishment during 2020.\nTenant improvements and lease-related costs pertaining to our initial leasing of newly completed space, or vacant space in acquired properties, are referred to as first generation expenditures. Such first generation expenditures for tenant improvements are included within \"development of real estate investments\" in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, while such expenditures for capitalizable lease-related costs are included within \"other deferred leasing costs.\"\n\nDevelopment\nSame-Property Net Operating Income - Cash Basis\nIn addition to our environmental initiatives, we are committed to fair compensation, fostering a dynamic and balanced work environment and providing employees with developmental opportunities to perform well and derive satisfaction from their work. We encourage our associates to participate in volunteer and community activities and support those who do participate by providing each associate with two paid community days per year. We also have charitable contribution programs, such as our dollars for doers program (matching dollars for volunteer hours spent) and our matching gifts program (matching dollars for employee donations to charities). In addition, we partner with various charitable organizations, including the American Red Cross since 2017. We maintain a formal and structured diversity, equity and inclusion program. We have increased diversity within our board of directors and 50% of the Independent Directors of the board are female or people of color. We implemented a Vendor Code of Conduct that outlines our expectations and standards for how our vendors operate while doing business on our behalf. Through all of these initiatives and others, we endeavor to make a positive impact on the communities in which we conduct business.\nWe are exposed to capital market risk, such as changes in interest rates. In order to reduce the volatility relating to interest rate risk, we may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements from time to time. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had on file with the SEC an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 relating to the offer and sale, from time to time, of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities (including guarantees of the Partnership's debt securities by the General Partner). Equity securities are offered and sold by the General Partner, and the net proceeds of such offerings are contributed to the Partnership in exchange for additional General Partner Units or Preferred Units. From time to time, we expect to issue additional securities under this automatic shelf registration statement to fund the repayment of debt, to fund development and future acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes.\nThe table below reflects our consolidated in-service portfolio lease expiration schedule at December 31, 2020 (in thousands, except percentage data and number of leases):\nInvesting Activities\n\u2022property investment;\nThe pandemic's impact on the overall global economy is continuing and the ultimate impact cannot be predicted at this time. Please see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" for additional information about the potential impacts the pandemic may have on our business and results of operations.\n\u2022In February 2020, a consolidated joint venture of the Partnership obtained a secured loan from a third party financial institution for gross proceeds of $18.4 million. No secured loans were obtained in 2019 or 2018.\nGuarantee Obligations\nCost Capitalization: Direct and certain indirect costs, including interest, clearly associated with the development, construction or expansion of real estate investments are capitalized as a cost of the property.\nDebt Extinguishment\nOur operating results depend primarily upon rental income from our Rental Operations. The following discussion highlights the metrics that drive the performance of our Rental Operations, which management uses to operate the business, and that we consider to be critical drivers of future revenues.\nCash flows from Rental Operations is our primary source of liquidity and provides a stable source of cash flow to fund operational expenses. We believe that this cash-based revenue stream is substantially aligned with revenue recognition (except for items such as periodic straight-line rental income accruals and amortization of above or below market rents) as cash receipts from the leasing of rental properties are generally received in advance of, or a short time following, the actual revenue recognition.\nOverview\nIn addition to NAREIT FFO we use (i) Property Level Net Operating Income - Cash Basis (\"PNOI\") and (ii) Same-Property Net Operating Income - Cash Basis (\"SPNOI\") as supplemental non-GAAP performance measures. Management believes that the use of PNOI and SPNOI combined with net income (which remains the primary measure of performance), improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and makes comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. The most comparable GAAP measure to PNOI and SPNOI is income from continuing operations before income taxes.\nSupplemental Performance Measures\n\u2022In 2019, we paid off a special assessment bond for $9.9 million, which was reflected within Other Financing Activities on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We did not make similar significant repayments during 2020 or 2018.\nOur decision process in determining whether or not to acquire a property or portfolio of properties involves several factors, including expected rent growth, multiple yield metrics, property locations and expected demographic growth in each location, current occupancy of the properties, tenant profile and remaining terms of the in-place leases in the properties. It is difficult to predict which markets may present acquisition opportunities that align with our strategy. Because of the numerous factors considered in our acquisition decisions, we do not establish specific target yields for future acquisitions.\nThe increase to cash flow provided by operating activities between 2019 and 2018 was due to the timing of cash receipts and cash payments on third party construction projects as well as increased cash flows from our Rental Operations. These increases in operating cash flows were partially offset by increased cash paid for interest and income taxes as well as the timing of working capital.\n\nResults of Operations\nTransactions with unconsolidated joint ventures also provide a source of liquidity. From time to time we will sell properties to unconsolidated joint ventures, while retaining a continuing interest in that entity, and receive proceeds commensurate to those interests that we do not own. Additionally, unconsolidated joint ventures will from time to time obtain debt financing or sell properties and will then distribute to us, and our joint venture partners, all or a portion of the proceeds from such transactions. There were no material transactions with unconsolidated joint ventures in 2020.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe Partnership's unsecured line of credit has an interest rate that is indexed to LIBOR. In 2017, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\"ARRC\") proposed that the Secured Overnight Funding Rate (\"SOFR\") replace LIBOR. ARRC also proposed that the transition to SOFR from LIBOR take place by the end of 2021. As the Partnership's unsecured line of credit agreement has provisions that allow for automatic transition to a new rate and the Partnership has no other material debt arrangements that are indexed to LIBOR, we believe that the transition will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n\u2022During 2020, the General Partner issued 4.6 million common shares pursuant to its ATM equity programs for net proceeds of $175.0 million, compared to 8.0 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $263.3 million in 2019 and 990,400 shares of common stock for net proceeds of $28.4 million in 2018.\nThe following table summarizes our second generation capital expenditures by type of expenditure, as well as capital expenditures for the development of real estate investments and for other deferred leasing costs (in thousands):\nLeasing/Capital Costs\nDepreciation and amortization expense from continuing operations was $353.0 million and $327.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily the result of continued growth in our portfolio through development and acquisitions placed in service from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020, partially offset by the impact of property sales that did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.\n\u2022During 2020, we repaid one fixed rate secured loan, totaling $9.0 million, which had a stated interest rate of 5.61%.\nDebt Service and Maturities\n\u2022We paid cash of $632.1 million, $598.4 million and $592.4 million, for real estate and undeveloped land acquisitions during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\n\u2022We increased net borrowings on the Partnership's unsecured line of credit by $295.0 million in 2020, decreased net borrowings by $30.0 million in 2019 and increased net borrowings by $30.0 million in 2018.\nIn assessing the amount of indirect costs to be capitalized, we first allocate payroll costs, on a department-by-department basis, among activities for which capitalization is warranted (i.e., construction and development and leasing) and those for which capitalization is not warranted (i.e., property management, maintenance, acquisitions, dispositions, non-incremental leasing costs and general corporate functions). To the extent the employees of a department split their time between capitalizable and non-capitalizable activities, the allocations are made based on estimates of the actual amount of time spent in each activity. Once the payroll costs are allocated, the non-payroll costs of each department are allocated among the capitalizable and non-capitalizable activities in the same proportion as payroll costs.\nDividend and Distribution Requirements\n\u2022The total estimated cost of our properties under construction at December 31, 2020, with costs for unconsolidated properties shown at 100%, totaled $1.10 billion, with $690.1 million of such costs already incurred. The total estimated cost for the one unconsolidated joint venture property under construction at December 31, 2020 was $57.0 million, with $22.6 million of such costs already incurred. The consolidated properties under construction were 64.5% pre-leased, while the unconsolidated joint venture property under construction was 100% pre-leased.\nRental Expenses and Real Estate Taxes\nGrowth in average annual net effective rents for new second generation and renewal leases, on a combined basis, for our consolidated and unconsolidated rental properties, is as follows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\u2022We paid regular cash dividends or distributions of $0.96, $0.88 and $0.815 per common share or per Common Unit during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nPNOI and SPNOI each exclude expenses that materially impact our overall results of operations and, therefore, should not be considered as a substitute for income from continuing operations before income taxes, or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Furthermore, these metrics may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe following table sets forth the components of net earnings from the Service Operations reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively (in thousands):\nDuring 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have made various changes to our operations in order to support the health and safety of our associates and the communities in which we operate. Throughout the pandemic, accelerated e-commerce demand drove strong leasing activity, while the pandemic also negatively impacted a relatively small portion of our tenant base that operate in lines of business, such as event planning, that were most acutely impacted by COVID-19. Through December 31, 2020, we executed deferral agreements with certain customers that allowed for $7.4 million of total scheduled rental payments to be deferred and repaid in future periods. The substantial majority of these agreements were short term in nature and required repayment of the deferred amounts within twelve months of their execution. We have collected all amounts due under such short term rent deferral agreements through the end of 2020. We temporarily paused our acquisition, disposition and development activities at the onset of the pandemic but such activities were resumed at an accelerated pace during the second half of the year.\n(3) The decrease in allocation of costs to Service Operations and Rental Operations resulted from a lower volume of third-party construction projects during 2020.\nOur business operations primarily consist of two reportable operating segments: rental operations of industrial properties and service operations. Rental operations of industrial properties represent the ownership and development of industrial properties and is the primary component of our revenues and earnings. Service operations generate additional revenues from providing various real estate services primarily relating to development, construction management and property management services to customers, unconsolidated joint ventures and third-party owners.\n\nNationwide demand for industrial properties continues to be strong in the current economic environment as the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated both consumer acceptance of e-commerce and the requirements of many retailers to increase inventory levels. Our operational focus is to maintain occupancy at high levels and to focus on rental rate growth. The occupancy of our consolidated industrial portfolio increased to 97.4% at December 31, 2020 as compared to 96.6% at December 31, 2019. Our annual net effective rents for both renewals and new second generation leases, on a combined basis, for consolidated properties grew 28.2% in 2020 compared to 2019. In the current environment of rising rental rates for industrial properties in many of the markets in which we operate, we believe there is potential for continued future rental rate growth to the extent we are able to renew or backfill expiring leases and maintain high levels of occupancy.\nOur unsecured line of credit at December 31, 2020 is described as follows (in thousands):\nIn June 2020, we repurchased and canceled $216.3 million of unsecured notes that were scheduled to mature in October 2022 pursuant to a tender offer completed by the Partnership.\nOur overall strategy is to increase our investment in quality industrial properties primarily through development, on both a speculative and build-to-suit basis, supplemented with acquisitions in the markets we believe have the highest growth potential.\nProperty Investment\nA summary of our operating results and property statistics for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, is as follows (in thousands, except number of properties and per share or per Common Unit data):\nAsset Strategy\nOccupancy Analysis\nLease Commitments\n\u2022We started new development projects with expected total costs of $795.6 million, which included $78.0 million of expected total costs for development projects started within two unconsolidated joint ventures. The development projects started in 2020 were, in aggregate, 62.0% leased at December 31, 2020.\nOur operational focus is to drive profitability by maximizing cash from operations as well as NAREIT FFO through (i) maintaining property occupancy, increasing rental rates and prioritizing timely collection of monthly rental payments, while also keeping lease-related capital costs contained, by effectively managing our portfolio of existing properties; (ii) selectively developing new build-to-suit, substantially pre-leased and, in select markets, speculative development projects; and (iii) providing a full line of real estate services to our tenants and to third parties.\nsecond generation and renewal leases, on a combined basis, executed for consolidated and unconsolidated joint venture properties during the year resulted in 28.2% and 33.8%, respectively, increases to net effective rents (\"net effective rents\" is defined hereafter in the \"Key Performance Indicators\" section) when compared to the previous leases of the same space.\nOperating Activities\nIn February 2020, a consolidated joint venture obtained an $18.4 million secured loan from a third party financial institution, with a fixed annual interest rate of 3.41% and a maturity date of March 1, 2035.\n\nWe regularly work to identify, consider and pursue opportunities to dispose of properties in a manner that is generally consistent with our strategic plans. Our ability to dispose of such properties on favorable terms, or at all, is dependent upon a number of factors including the availability of credit to potential buyers to purchase properties at prices that we consider acceptable. Although we believe that we have demonstrated our ability to generate significant liquidity through the disposition of non-strategic properties, potential future adverse changes to general market and economic conditions, including the uncertain economic outlook caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, could negatively impact our further ability to dispose of such properties.\nBoth our first and second generation expenditures vary significantly between leases on a per square foot basis, dependent upon several factors including the nature of a tenant's operations, the specific physical characteristics of each individual property and the market in which the property is located.\nFinancing Activities\n\u2022other contractual obligations.\nWe had 7.4 million square feet of property under development with total estimated costs upon completion of $1.10 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to 8.9 million square feet with total estimated costs upon completion of $1.06 billion at December 31, 2019. The square footage and estimated costs include both consolidated properties and unconsolidated joint venture development activity at 100%.\nWe expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements over the next 12 months, which include payments of dividends and distributions, completion of development projects that are currently under construction and the capital expenditures needed to maintain our current real estate assets, through working capital, net cash provided by operating activities and short term borrowings on the Partnership's unsecured line of credit. We had $295.0 million outstanding borrowings on the Partnership's $1.20 billion unsecured line of credit, had $6.3 million of cash on hand and held $47.7 million of restricted cash in escrow for future like kind exchange transactions at December 31, 2020.\nOur ability to maintain and improve occupancy and net effective rents primarily depends upon our continuing ability to lease vacant space. The volume and quality of our leasing activity is closely scrutinized by management in operation of the business and provides useful information regarding future performance. The initial leasing of development projects or vacant space in acquired properties is referred to as first generation lease activity. The leasing of such space that we have previously held under lease to a tenant is referred to as second generation lease activity. Second generation lease activity may be in the form of renewals of existing leases or new second generation leases of previously leased space. The total leasing activity for our consolidated and unconsolidated industrial rental properties, expressed in square feet of leases signed, is as follows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nVacancy Activity\n\u2022dividends and distributions to shareholders and unitholders;\nFinancial Instruments\nCash expenditures related to the construction of a building's shell, as well as the associated site improvements, are also included within \"development of real estate investments\" in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nThe composition of the line items titled \"Rental Operations revenues and expenses excluded from PNOI\" and \"Non-Segment Items\" from the table above are shown in greater detail in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report.\nDuring 2020, we redeemed $300.0 million of unsecured notes with a stated interest rate of 4.38% and repurchased and canceled $216.3 million of unsecured notes with a stated interest rate of 3.88% pursuant to a tender offer completed by the Partnership. In connection with redemption and repurchase of these unsecured notes, we recognized a total loss of $32.9 million including the redemption/repayment premium and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.\nOccupancy is an important metric for management and our investors for understanding our financial performance. Our ability to maintain high occupancy rates is among the principal drivers of maintaining and increasing rental revenue. The following table sets forth percent leased and average net effective rent information regarding our in-service portfolio of rental properties at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively:\nLease Expirations\n\nDebt outstanding at December 31, 2020 had a face value totaling $3.41 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 3.17% and maturities at various dates through 2050. Of this total amount, we had $3.06 billion of unsecured debt, $60.6 million of secured debt and $295.0 million outstanding borrowings on our unsecured line of credit at December 31, 2020. Scheduled principal amortization, maturities and early repayments of such debt totaled $529.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nSales of land and properties provided $336.3 million in net proceeds in 2020, compared to $432.7 million in 2019 and $511.4 million in 2018.\n\u2022We acquired ten industrial properties during the year ended December 31, 2020 with a total asset value of $424.9 million.\n\nIn October 2018, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board issued the Real Estate Sustainability Accounting Standards. The standards are intended to provide a minimum set of sustainability metrics for disclosure in SEC filings, such as this Form 10-K. We understand the importance of reporting comparable, consistent and financially material sustainability metrics. Below is a chart showing our information for the applicable metrics.\n\u2022leasing/capital costs;\nIn March 2020, we redeemed $300.0 million of unsecured notes that were scheduled to mature in June 2022.\n\u2022The Partnership repaid one secured loan for $9.0 million during 2020, compared to repayments of three secured loans for $41.7 million in 2019 and three secured loans for $227.1 million in 2018.\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist of two components. The first component includes general corporate expenses, and the second component represents the indirect operating costs not allocated to, or absorbed by, either the development, leasing and operation of our consolidated properties or our Service Operations. Such indirect operating costs are primarily comprised of employee compensation, including related costs such as benefits and wage-related taxes, but also include other ancillary costs such as travel and information technology support. Total indirect operating costs, prior to any allocation or absorption, and general corporate expenses are collectively referred to as our overall pool of overhead costs.\nYear in Review\nWe sold seven properties during 2020 that were classified in continuing operations, recognizing total gains on sale of $127.7 million. These properties did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.\nWe regularly work to identify, consider and pursue opportunities to dispose of properties on an opportunistic basis and on a basis that is generally consistent with our strategic plans. Dispositions of properties is a source of capital to fund future investment.\nOur capital strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet by actively managing the components of our capital structure in coordination with the execution of our overall operational and asset strategies. We are focused on maintaining our current investment grade ratings from our credit rating agencies. As of December 31, 2020, our senior unsecured notes have been assigned a rating of Baa1 by Moody's Investors Services and BBB+ by Standard & Poor's Ratings Group and we are focused on maintaining such ratings in order to maintain access to liquidity. A securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules of this report and the matters described under Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nCapital Strategy\nAt December 31, 2020, we:\nTotal Leasing Activity\nWe define our \"same-property\" population once a year at the beginning of the current calendar year and include buildings that were stabilized (the term \"stabilized\" means properties that have reached 90% leased or that have been in-service for at least one year since development completion or acquisition) as of January 1 of the prior calendar year. The \"same-property\" pool is also adjusted to remove properties that were sold subsequent to the beginning of the current calendar year. As such, the \"same-property\" population for the period ended December 31, 2020 includes all properties that we owned or jointly controlled at January 1, 2020, which had both been owned or jointly controlled and had reached stabilization by January 1, 2019, and have not been sold.\nThe following table sets forth rental expenses and real estate taxes from continuing operations (in thousands):\nOverall, real estate tax expense from continuing operations increased by $19.8 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase to real estate taxes was mainly the result of acquisitions and developments placed in service from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020, which have generally been concentrated in markets with higher tax rates and/or assessed values, and increased tax assessments in certain of our markets. These increases were partially offset by the impact of property sales that did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.\n\nIn January 2021, we issued $450.0 million of senior unsecured notes with a stated interest rate of 1.75%, which will mature on February 1, 2031. These notes are our second green bond issuance with the first issuance completed in November 2019. The net proceeds will be used to finance future or refinance recently completed eligible green projects\u201d. These projects may include green buildings, energy efficiency projects, sustainable water and wastewater management systems, renewable energy projects, clean transportation solutions and pollution prevention and control.\nInterest expense allocable to continuing operations was $93.4 million and $89.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in interest expense from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was largely the result of increased overall borrowings and lower capitalization of interest expense, partially offset by lower average interest rates during 2020 as the result of refinancing certain of our unsecured notes.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nImpairment of Real Estate Assets: We evaluate our real estate assets, with the exception of those that are classified as held-for-sale, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If such an evaluation is considered necessary, we compare the carrying amount of that real estate asset, or asset group, with the expected undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with, and that are expected to arise as a direct result of, the use and eventual disposition of that asset, or asset group. Our estimate of the expected future cash flows used in testing for impairment is based on, among other things, our estimates regarding future market conditions, rental rates, occupancy levels, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other tenant concessions, assumptions regarding the residual value of our properties at the end of our anticipated holding period and the length of our anticipated holding period and is, therefore, subjective by nature. These assumptions could differ materially from actual results. If our strategy changes or if market conditions otherwise dictate a reduction in the holding period and an earlier sale date, an impairment loss could be recognized and such loss could be material. To the extent the carrying amount of a real estate asset, or asset group, exceeds the associated estimate of undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its fair value.\nRental and Related Revenue\nIn support of our capital strategy, we employ an asset disposition program to sell certain real estate assets, which generate proceeds that can be recycled into new property investments that better fit our growth objectives or otherwise manage our capital structure.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nWe had consolidated properties under development with an expected total cost of $1.04 billion at December 31, 2020, compared to projects with an expected cost of $1.05 billion and $709.7 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We had $374.9 million of remaining costs to complete for consolidated properties under development at December 31, 2020.\n\u2022opportunistic repurchases of outstanding debt; and\n\n\u2022We receive capital distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures, either as the result of selling our ownership interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures or from our share of the proceeds from property sales from unconsolidated joint ventures. In 2020, we received $876,000 in capital distributions primarily from one unconsolidated joint venture from the sale of land. We received $26.3 million in capital distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures during 2019, primarily related to the sale of three properties within three of our unconsolidated joint ventures. We received $23.1 million in capital distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures during 2018, primarily related to the sale of six properties within three of our unconsolidated joint ventures.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2020 to Year Ended December 31, 2019\n\u2022We generated $336.3 million of total net cash proceeds from the disposition of seven consolidated buildings and 157 acres of wholly owned undeveloped land.\n\u2022The increase in rental revenue was also partially offset by a $4.0 million increase in collectability reserves for contractual and straight-line receivables, primarily as a result of current economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.\nAlso in February 2020, we issued $325.0 million of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at a stated interest rate of 3.05%, have an effective interest of 3.19%, and mature on March 1, 2050, for gross proceeds of $316.4 million.\nThe General Partner and Partnership collectively specialize in the ownership, management and development of industrial real estate. The General Partner is a self-administered and self-managed REIT that began operations in 1986 and is the sole general partner of the Partnership. The Partnership is a limited partnership formed in 1993, at which time all of the properties and related assets and liabilities of the General Partner, as well as proceeds from a secondary offering of the General Partner's common shares, were contributed to the Partnership. Simultaneously, the Partnership completed the acquisition of Duke Associates, a full-service commercial real estate firm operating in the Midwest whose operations began in 1972. We operate the General Partner and the Partnership as one enterprise, and therefore, our discussion and analysis refers to the General Partner and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Partnership, collectively.\nNAREIT FFO attributable to common shareholders of the General Partner totaled $521.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $510.5 million for 2019. NAREIT FFO attributable to common unitholders of the Partnership totaled $526.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $514.9 million for 2019. The increase to NAREIT FFO from 2019 for the General Partner and the Partnership was primarily driven by improved occupancy, rental rate growth and new developments being placed into service and leased up, partially offset by debt extinguishment costs recognized during 2020.\n\u2022We made capital contributions and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures in the amounts of $6.2 million, $34.5 million and $5.9 million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe capital expenditures in the table above include the capitalization of internal overhead costs. We capitalized $6.5 million, $6.8 million and $19.0 million of overhead costs that are incremental to executing leases, including both first and second generation leases, during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We capitalized $28.8 million, $24.2 million and $29.8 million of overhead costs related to development activities, including both development and tenant improvement projects on first and second generation space, during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Combined overhead costs capitalized to leasing and development totaled 26.7%, 22.8% and 35.1% of our overall pool of overhead costs at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in the overhead costs capitalized to leasing for 2020 and 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to the expense impact of internal costs related to successful leasing which were not capitalizable as a result of the adoption of the new lease standard on January 1, 2019 (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report) and was included in the line item \"Non-incremental costs related to successful leases\" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for 2020 and 2019.\nWe believe that the factors that impact SPNOI are generally the same as those that impact PNOI. The following table details the number of properties, square feet, average commencement occupancy and average cash rental rate for the properties included in SPNOI for the respective periods:\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Certain estimates, judgments and assumptions are inherently subjective and based on the existing business and market conditions, and are therefore continually evaluated based upon available information and experience. Based on the nature of our business, current economic conditions and the value of our real estate assets, we have concluded that our financial statements for all periods presented have not been materially impacted by individual accounts or classes of transaction that rely on estimates. Further, we have concluded that our financial statements for all periods presented are not materially impacted by estimates of fair value that rely upon non-observable inputs.", "item_7_text": "\nThe following table summarizes our properties under development at December 31, 2020 (in thousands, except percentage data):\n\u2022The increase in rental revenue included a $17.3 million increase in expense recoveries primarily related to higher recoverable real estate taxes compared to 2019.\nNote 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies. Our management has assessed the accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements and discussed them with our audit committee and independent auditors. The following accounting policies are considered critical based upon materiality to the financial statements, and to a lesser extent, the degree of judgment involved in estimating reported amounts and sensitivity to changes in industry and economic conditions:\n\u2022debt service and maturities;\nIn June 2020, we issued $350.0 million of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at a stated interest rate of 1.75%, have an effective interest of 1.85%, and mature on July 1, 2030, for gross proceeds of $346.8 million.\nThe major factors influencing PNOI are occupancy levels, acquisitions and sales, development properties that achieve stabilized operations, rental rate increases or decreases, and the recoverability of operating expenses.\nGain on Sale of Properties - Continuing Operations\nBuilding Acquisitions\nThose indirect costs not allocated to or absorbed by these operations are charged to general and administrative expenses. We regularly review our total overhead cost structure relative to our leasing, development and construction volume and adjust the level of total overhead, generally through changes in our level of staffing in various functional departments, as necessary, in order to control overall general and administrative expense.\nWe capitalized $24.3 million and $26.5 million of interest costs during 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe increase in occupancy at December 31, 2020 within our industrial portfolio, when compared to December 31, 2019, primarily resulted from leasing up recently delivered speculative developments while renewing or backfilling existing leases to maintain the occupancy level within our existing base of properties.\n\u2022Sales of land and property generated net proceeds of $336.3 million, $432.7 million and $511.4 million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThere were no property sales by unconsolidated joint ventures during 2020.\n\u2022During 2020, the General Partner issued 4.6 million common shares under its at the market (\"ATM\") equity program, generating gross proceeds of $177.1 million and, after deducting commissions and other costs, net proceeds of $175.0 million.\nWe expect to continue to distribute at least an amount equal to our taxable earnings, to meet the requirements to maintain the General Partner's REIT status, and additional amounts as determined by the General Partner's board of directors. Distributions are declared at the discretion of the General Partner's board of directors and are subject to actual cash available for distribution, our financial condition, capital requirements and such other factors as the General Partner's board of directors deems relevant.\nInterest Expense\n\u2022Changes in book cash overdrafts are classified as financing activities within our consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Book cash overdrafts were $16.4 million, $14.4 million and $14.3 million at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nImpact of Changes in Credit Ratings on Our Liquidity\nThe following table sets forth vacancy activity, shown in square feet, from our in-service rental properties for the year ended December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\n\u2022In February 2020, we issued $325.0 million of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at a stated interest rate of 3.05%, have an effective interest rate of 3.19%, and mature on March 1, 2050. Proceeds from the unsecured notes offering were primarily used to repay the $300.0 million of senior unsecured notes bearing a stated interest rate of 4.38% and with a scheduled maturity of 2022. In connection with the early redemption of these notes, we recognized a loss of $17.8 million consisting of a prepayment premium and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.\n\u2022We issued $675.0 million, $575.0 million and $450.0 million of senior unsecured notes during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The 2020 unsecured debt issuances consist of $325.0 million of senior unsecured notes issued in February 2020 for gross proceeds of $316.4 million and $350.0 million of senior unsecured notes issued in June 2020 for gross proceeds of $346.8 million. The 2019 unsecured debt issuances consist of $175.0 million of senior unsecured notes issued in August 2019 for gross proceeds of $182.3 million and $400.0 million of senior unsecured notes issued in November 2019 with a corresponding cash payment of $35.6 million for termination of the five forward starting interest rate swaps entered in 2018 and 2019. We issued $450.0 million of senior unsecured notes in 2018.\nWe are currently assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes from Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's Ratings Group. Our senior unsecured notes have been assigned a rating of Baa1 by Moody's Investors Service. In addition, our senior unsecured notes have been assigned a rating of BBB+ by Standard & Poor's Ratings Group. A securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization.\nThe following table is a summary of the scheduled future amortization and maturities of our indebtedness at December 31, 2020 (in thousands, except percentage data):\n\u2022Second generation tenant improvements, leasing costs and building improvements totaled $41.1 million, $47.5 million and $53.5 million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe Partnership's unsecured line of credit is reflected in the table above as maturing in January 2023, based on the ability to exercise the two six-month extension options from its stated maturity date of January 2022 (see Note 9). In January 2021, we issued $450.0 million of senior unsecured notes that bear a stated interest rate of 1.75%, have an effective interest rate of 1.83%, and mature on February 1, 2031. Proceeds from the unsecured notes offering were initially applied to pay down outstanding borrowings on our line of credit as of December 31, 2020, and we intend to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from the offering to the financing or refinancing of eligible green projects.\nTo the extent applicable marketplace data is available, we generally use the market approach in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land that is determined to be impaired.\nWe strive to maintain an effective corporate governance structure and comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations and policies. Further, we publish Corporate Responsibility Reports that formally communicate our commitments and leadership around ESG issues. Please see Item 1 - Corporate Governance\u201d for more information regarding our governance initiatives.\nWe anticipate generating capital to fund our debt maturities by using undistributed cash generated from our Rental Operations and property dispositions and by raising additional capital from future debt or equity transactions.\nThe General Partner is required to meet the distribution requirements of the Code in order to maintain its REIT status. We paid regular dividends or distributions of $0.96, $0.88 and $0.815 per common share or Common Unit for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures represents our ownership share of net income from investments in unconsolidated joint ventures that generally own and operate rental properties. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures was $11.9 million and $31.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2019, we recorded equity in earnings of $19.4 million related to our share of the gain on sale of five unconsolidated joint venture buildings and equity in earnings of $1.3 million representing our share of gains on involuntary conversion from insurance recoveries related to storm damage in one unconsolidated joint venture.\nEquity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\nOperational Strategy\nWe recognized $5.6 million of impairment charges during the first quarter of 2020, related to writing off pre-acquisition costs, primarily non-refundable purchase deposits, for certain planned purchases of undeveloped land that we elected not to pursue due to the uncertain economic outlook at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe following table shows a reconciliation of net income attributable to common shareholders or common unitholders to the calculation of funds from operations (\"FFO\") attributable to common shareholders or common unitholders for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively (in thousands):\nGains on sale of land totaled $10.5 million and $7.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We sold 157 acres of undeveloped land in 2020 compared to 110 acres of undeveloped land in 2019.\nThe Partnership has issued debt securities pursuant to certain indentures and related supplemental indentures, which also require us to comply with financial ratios and other covenants regarding our operations. We were in compliance with all such covenants at December 31, 2020.\nWe are focused on promoting our growth in a sustainable way, one that succeeds by delivering long-term value for our stakeholders. As part of our vision to continually set the standard for maximizing stakeholder value, we have a long-standing commitment to sustainable practices in environmental, social and corporate governance initiatives. On December 17, 2019, we adopted a Sustainable Development Policy intended to increase the operational efficiency of our buildings and promote sustainable design principles. We are committed to integrating innovative, sustainable building design features in alignment with U.S. Green Building Council's\u00ae Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (or LEED\u00ae), including constructing to LEED\u00ae criteria and achieving certification in all new developments where feasible. While we do not control most of the utility usage at our properties, we have been partnering with a third party data management provider since 2018 in order to help monitor and manage the utility usage that we do control. In 2018, we also became a member of GRESB, a leading provider of real estate ESG benchmarking and performance assessments. Since joining, our GRESB score has steadily increased, evidencing our commitment and continued progress. We expect to continue participating in the GRESB benchmarking assessments.\nThe primary reasons for the increase in rental and related revenue from continuing operations were:\nA reconciliation of income from continuing operations before income taxes to SPNOI is presented as follows (in thousands, except percentage data):\nThe most comparable GAAP measure to NAREIT FFO is net income attributable to common shareholders or common unitholders. Management believes it is a useful indicator of consolidated operating performance, which improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public, makes comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful and enables investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the long-term assets that form the core of a REIT's activity.\n\nThe audit committee has reviewed the critical accounting policies identified by management.\n\n\u2022Total leasing activity for our consolidated properties totaled 25.5 million square feet in 2020 compared to 28.7 million square feet in 2019.\nAdditionally, as of December 31, 2020, we guaranteed the repayment of $20.1 million of economic development bonds issued by various municipalities in connection with certain commercial developments.\n\u2022Total leasing activity for our consolidated and unconsolidated joint venture properties in 2020 included 6.1 million and 1.1 million, respectively, square feet of lease renewals (excludes early renewals and short term renewals), which represented 65.6% and 86.8%, respectively, retention rates on a square foot basis. New\n\u2022During 2020, we received repayments of $110.0 million on notes receivable from property sales, compared to $162.6 million and $154.1 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nTransactions with Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\nOn an individual property basis, SPNOI is generally computed in a consistent manner as PNOI.\nWe are subject to various guarantee obligations in the normal course of business and, in most cases, do not anticipate these obligations to result in significant cash payments. At December 31, 2020, we guaranteed the repayment of $81.3 million of loans associated with two of our unconsolidated joint ventures. In January 2021, we, and the other partner in one of these unconsolidated joint ventures, repaid $69.8 million of such guaranteed loans.\n\nOur strategic objectives include (i) increasing our investment in quality industrial properties through development, including facilities with sustainable design features that will meet customer needs; (ii) acquiring properties primarily in coastal Tier 1 markets which we believe provide the best potential for future rental growth; and (iii) maintaining an optimal land inventory through selected strategic land acquisitions and new development activity. We are continuing to execute our asset strategy through a disciplined approach by identifying development opportunities, identifying select acquisition targets where the asset quality and pricing meet our objectives and continually evaluating our portfolio for disposition by regularly identifying assets that no longer meet our long-term objectives.\nIn accordance with our strategic plan, we continue to increase our investment in high-quality industrial properties, with build-to-suit developments across all of our markets and most of our speculative development focused in the markets we believe have the best long-term growth potential. Additionally, we continued to maintain high occupancy levels through 2020 and quickly lease a significant portion of our speculative development projects. Highlights of our 2020 strategic and operational activities are as follows:\nThe following items highlight significant capital transactions:\nOur principal uses of liquidity include the following:\n\u2022Owned directly, or through ownership interests in unconsolidated joint ventures (with acreage not adjusted for our percentage ownership interest), approximately 1,000 acres of land and controlled approximately 800 acres through purchase options.\nWe sold seven consolidated buildings during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 28 consolidated buildings during the year ended December 31, 2019. The following table summarizes the sales prices, in-place yields and percent leased of industrial building dispositions (in thousands, except percentage data):\nThrough all of our environmental, social and governance efforts, we demonstrate that operating and developing commercial real estate can be conducted with a conscious regard for the environment and community, while also benefiting our investors, employees, tenants and the communities in which we operate.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nService Operations\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $62.4 million and $60.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The following table sets forth the factors that led to the increase in general and administrative expenses from 2019 to 2020 (in millions):\nWe capitalize interest and direct and indirect project costs associated with the initial construction of a property up to the time the property is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. We capitalize all such costs through the completion of the building shell. The interest rate used to capitalize interest is based upon our average borrowing rate on existing debt.\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for 2020 compared to 2019 is under the Results of Operations section below. Our financial condition for 2018 and results of operations for 2019 compared to 2018 can be found under Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which is incorporated herein by this reference to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 25, 2020, and is available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and the Investor Relations section of our website at www.dukerealty.com.\nFurther discussion of the capitalization of overhead costs can be found in the year-to-year comparison of general and administrative expenses and Critical Accounting Policies sections of this Item 7.\nRepayments of Outstanding Debt\nThe United States economy in 2020 experienced an unprecedented downturn as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic with the gross domestic product declining by 3.5%. The recession was caused by dramatic changes in consumer behavior linked to business shutdowns, travel restrictions, and social distancing during the pandemic. The magnitude of the declines in gross domestic product and employment in the spring was unprecedented. Since then, economic activity and job growth have begun to recover as parts of the economy reopened, bolstered by the initial dissemination of vaccines and government stimulus, but remain well below pre-pandemic levels. The 10-year treasury yield trended down throughout the year fluctuating from 0.5% to 1.9% and ending the year at 0.9%, down from 1.9% at the end of 2019. While the economy has declined overall during 2020, the industrial real estate sector has been one of the most resilient sectors during the pandemic, which has been largely driven by e-commerce demand and additional demand from suppliers to drive up safety stock. We continued to pursue quality industrial assets in coastal Tier 1 markets during 2020. We resumed speculative development projects in the second half of the year and continued to lease up the speculative space. Despite the global crisis, we were able to execute our asset and capital strategies for the year and had a successful 2020.\n\nDepreciation and Amortization\nNet income attributable to the common shareholders of the General Partner for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $299.9 million, compared to net income of $429.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net income attributable to the common unitholders of the Partnership for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $302.6\nThe following table sets forth rental and related revenue from continuing operations (in thousands):\n\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nTo the extent that it supports our overall capital strategy, we may purchase or redeem some of our outstanding unsecured notes prior to their stated maturities.\nTo ensure that an appropriate amount of costs are capitalized, the amount of capitalized construction and development costs that are allocated to a specific project are limited to amounts using standards we developed. These standards are based on a percentage of the total development costs of a project. These standards are derived after considering the amounts that would be allocated if the personnel in the departments were working at full capacity. The use of these standards ensures that overhead costs attributable to downtime or to unsuccessful projects are not capitalized. Additionally, only internal leasing costs that are incremental, which are comprised of success-based leasing payments to our in-house leasing personnel, are capitalized.\nSources of Liquidity\n\u2022In June 2020, we issued $350.0 million of senior unsecured notes, which bear interest at a stated interest rate of 1.75%, have an effective interest rate of 1.85% and mature on July 1, 2030. Proceeds from the unsecured notes offering were primarily used to repurchase and cancel $216.3 million of 3.88% senior unsecured notes due 2022 pursuant to a tender offer completed by the Partnership in June 2020. In connection with the early cancellation of these notes, we recognized a loss of $15.1 million consisting of a prepayment premium and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.\nWe also capitalize direct and indirect costs, including interest costs, on vacant space during extended lease-up periods, after construction of the building shell has been completed, if costs are being incurred to ready the vacant space for its intended use. If costs and activities incurred to ready the vacant space cease, then cost capitalization is also discontinued until such activities are resumed. Once necessary work has been completed on a vacant space, project costs are no longer capitalized. We cease capitalization of all project costs on extended lease-up periods after the shorter of a one-year period after the completion of the building shell or when the property attains 90% occupancy.\nWe did not recognize any impairment charges in 2019.\n(1) We recognized approximately $4.5 million of overhead restructuring charges included within general and administrative expenses. These charges primarily related to benefits provided to certain associates that terminated employment either as part of a voluntary retirement package offered to certain eligible employees during 2020 or in connection with other organizational changes.\nThis line of credit contains financial covenants that require us to meet certain financial ratios and defined levels of performance, including those related to fixed charge coverage, unsecured interest expense coverage and debt-to-asset value (with asset value being defined in the Partnership's unsecured line of credit agreement). At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all covenants under this line of credit.\n\n(1) FFO is a non-GAAP measure used in the real estate industry and is computed in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"). NAREIT FFO is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental operating performance measure of a REIT. NAREIT FFO is calculated as net income attributable to the common shareholders of the General Partner in accordance with GAAP excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains and losses on sales of real estate assets (including real estate assets incidental to our business), gains and losses from change in control, impairment charges related to real estate assets (including real estate assets incidental to our business) and similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, all net of related taxes.\nWe have determined that judgments regarding the impairment of real estate assets represent a critical accounting estimate that has the potential to be material in future periods and has been material in certain periods prior to those presented in this Form 10-K. As the result of the strong demand, and generally appreciating values, for industrial real estate assets, we have not recognized any material impairment charges in any of the periods presented in our consolidated financial statements. As described below in our description of Critical Accounting Policies, determining whether a triggering event has taken place requires an evaluation of assumptions including occupancy levels, rental rates, capitalization rates and anticipated holding periods when evaluating real estate assets for potential impairment. We do not believe that the conclusions we reached regarding the assessment of our real estate assets for impairment, in the current economic and operating environment, would result in a materially different conclusion within any reasonable range of assumptions that could have been applied. Should economic conditions worsen, and the values of industrial assets decline in future periods, then the assumptions and estimates we may make in future impairment analyses, and potential future measurement of impairment charges, could be sensitive and could result in a material change in the range of potential outcomes.\nCOVID-19\n\u2022Owned or jointly controlled 537 primarily industrial properties, of which 520 properties with 152.2 million square feet were in service and 17 properties with 7.4 million square feet were under development. The 520 in-service properties were comprised of 480 consolidated properties with 140.7 million square feet and 40 unconsolidated joint venture properties with 11.5 million square feet. The 17 properties under development consisted of 16 consolidated properties with 6.9 million square feet and one unconsolidated joint venture property with 517,000 square feet.\nSecond Generation Leases\nDuring 2019, we redeemed $250.0 million of unsecured notes, which had a stated interest rate of 3.88%. We recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $6.3 million, which included a prepayment premium and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.\nWe also evaluate the performance of our properties, including our share of properties we jointly control, on a \"same-property\" basis, using a metric referred to as SPNOI. We view SPNOI as a useful supplemental performance measure because it improves comparability between periods by eliminating the effects of changes in the composition of our portfolio.\nDebt and Equity Securities\n\u2022As the result of leasing up space in speculative developments throughout 2020, the percentage of total square feet leased for our in-service portfolio of consolidated properties increased from 96.6% at December 31, 2019 to 97.4% at December 31, 2020.\nThe ratings of our senior unsecured notes could change based upon, among other things, the impact that prevailing economic conditions may have on our results of operations and financial condition. If our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, we could be required, among other things, to pay additional interest and fees on outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement. Credit rating reductions by one or more rating agencies could also adversely affect our access to funding sources, the cost and other terms of obtaining funding, as well as our overall financial condition, operating results and cash flow.\nNote 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report shows a calculation of our PNOI for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 and provides a reconciliation of PNOI for our Rental Operations segments to income from continuing operations before income taxes.\nCash flows from operating activities provide the cash necessary to meet our operational requirements and the receipt of rental income from Rental Operations continues to be our primary source of operating cash flows. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities, compared to 2019, was driven by increasing our asset base through development, financed through equity or low cost debt issuances, and increasing occupancy and rental rates within our existing portfolio.\nThe following table sets forth the estimated costs of tenant improvements and leasing commissions, on a per square foot basis, that we are obligated to fulfill under the second generation industrial leases signed for our rental properties, during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\u2022Same-property net operating income, on a cash basis, as defined hereafter under \"Supplemental Performance Measures\", increased by 5.0% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019.\nHighlights of significant cash sources and uses are as follows:\nOverall, rental expenses from continuing operations increased by $1.1 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase to rental expenses was primarily the result of acquisitions and developments placed in service from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020, partially offset by the impact of property sales that did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations and decreased recoverable snow removal costs in 2020 compared to 2019.\nIn addition to the capitalization of overhead costs, the totals for development of real estate assets in the table above include the capitalization of $24.3 million, $26.5 million and $27.2 million of interest costs in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nIn addition to our existing sources of liquidity, we expect to meet long-term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled mortgage and unsecured debt maturities, financing of development activities, acquisitions and other capital improvements, through multiple sources of capital including operating cash flow, proceeds from property dispositions and accessing the public debt and equity markets.\nThe determination of the fair value of real estate assets is also highly subjective, especially in markets where there is a lack of recent comparable transactions. We primarily utilize the income approach to estimate the fair value of our income producing real estate assets. To the extent that the assumptions used in testing long-lived assets for impairment differ from those of a marketplace participant, the assumptions are modified in order to estimate the fair value of a real estate asset when an impairment charge is measured. In addition to determining future cash flows, which make the estimation of a real estate asset's undiscounted cash flows highly subjective, the selection of the discount rate and exit capitalization rate used in applying the income approach is also highly subjective.\n\nImpairment Charges\n\nOur overall strategy is to continue to increase our investment in quality industrial properties, primarily through development, on both a speculative and build-to-suit basis, supplemented with acquisitions in higher barrier markets with the highest growth potential. Pursuant to this strategy, we evaluate development and acquisition opportunities based upon our market outlook, including general economic conditions, supply and long-term growth potential. Our ability to make future property investments is dependent upon identifying suitable acquisition and development opportunities, and our continued access to our longer-term sources of liquidity, including issuances of debt or equity securities as well as generating cash flow by disposing of selected properties.\n\u2022During 2020, the Partnership paid cash of $547.0 million for the early redemption of $300.0 million of senior unsecured notes that were scheduled to mature in June 2022 and the early repurchase and cancellation of $216.3 million of senior unsecured notes due in October 2022. During 2019, the Partnership paid cash of $255.8 million for the early redemption of $250.0 million of senior unsecured notes that were scheduled to mature in February 2021. The Partnership repaid $7.0 million of unsecured debt in 2018.\nTenant improvements and leasing costs to renew or re-let rental space that we previously leased to tenants for second generation leases are referred to as second generation expenditures. Building improvements that are not specific to any tenant, but serve to improve integral components of our real estate properties, are also second generation expenditures. One of the principal uses of our liquidity is to fund the second generation leasing/capital expenditures of our real estate investments.\nWe continue to focus on maintaining a balanced and flexible capital structure which includes: (i) extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our outstanding debt obligations; (ii) borrowing primarily at fixed rates; and (iii) issuing common equity as needed to maintain appropriate leverage parameters or support significant strategic developments or acquisitions. With our successes to date and continued focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet, we expect to be in a position to be opportunistic in our investment opportunities.\nUses of Liquidity\nRental Operations\nAcquisition of Real Estate Property and Related Assets: We generally account for real estate acquisitions as asset acquisitions as opposed to business combinations. We allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identified intangible assets based on their relative fair values, using all pertinent information available at the date of acquisition. The allocation of the purchase price to tangible assets (buildings, tenant improvements and land) is based upon management's determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant. This as-if vacant\u201d value is estimated using an income, or discounted cash flow, approach that relies upon internally determined assumptions that we believe are consistent with current market conditions for similar properties. The most important assumptions in determining the allocation of the purchase price to tangible assets are the exit capitalization rate, estimated market rents and the fair value of the underlying land.\nPNOI is comprised of rental revenues from continuing operations less rental expenses and real estate taxes from continuing operations, along with certain other adjusting items. As a performance metric that consists of only the cash-based revenues and expenses directly related to ongoing real estate rental operations, PNOI is narrower in scope than NAREIT FFO.\nThe Partnership's unsecured line of credit has a borrowing capacity of $1.20 billion, with an interest rate on borrowings of LIBOR plus 0.875% (equal to 1.03% for our outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2020) and a maturity date of January 30, 2022, with options to extend until January 30, 2023. Subject to certain conditions, the terms also include an option to increase the facility by up to an additional $800.0 million, for a total of up to $2.00 billion. This line of credit provides us with an option to obtain borrowings from financial institutions that participate in the line at rates that may be lower than the stated interest rate, subject to certain restrictions.\nWe are subject to a number of risks, which have intensified as the result of the COVID-19 outbreak, related to general economic conditions, including reduced occupancy, tenant defaults and bankruptcies and potential reduction in rental rates upon renewal or re-letting of properties, any of which would result in reduced cash flow from operations.\nReal estate assets that are classified as held-for-sale are reported at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value, less estimated costs to sell.\nWe acquired ten buildings during the year ended December 31, 2020 and six buildings during the year ended December 31, 2019. The following table summarizes the acquisition price, percent leased at time of acquisition and in-place yields of industrial building acquisitions (in thousands, except percentage data):\nKey Performance Indicators\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (\"ESG\") Strategy\n\n\u2022Real estate development costs were $573.5 million, $446.8 million and $577.4 million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nGain on Sale of Land\nPNOI, as we calculate it, may not be directly comparable to similarly titled, but differently calculated, measures for other REITs. We believe that PNOI is another useful supplemental performance measure, as it is an input in many REIT valuation models and it provides a means by which to evaluate the performance of the properties within our Rental Operations segments. The operations of our industrial properties, as well as our non-reportable Rental Operations (our residual non-industrial properties that have not yet been sold, referred to throughout as \"non-reportable\"), are collectively referred to as \"Rental Operations.\"\nWe expect to generate future earnings from Rental Operations as development properties are placed in service and leased. Development activities, and our ability to lease those developments, are viewed by management as key indicators of future earnings growth and provide useful information to investors for the same reasons.\nProperty Level Net Operating Income - Cash Basis\n Topic Accounting Metric Code Our Information Energy Management Description of how building energy management considerations are integrated into property investment analysis and operational strategy IF-RE-130a.5 We integrate energy usage reduction measures on all new developments, incorporating LEED certification requirements and applicable aspects of our own sustainability policies/programs. These measures include energy modeling, high efficiency equipment (HVAC and lighting), and climate zone appropriate design factors. We have an ongoing lighting retrofit program, replacing outdated light fixtures with LED high efficiency fixtures. In 2020 we partnered with solar developers to increase the number of buildings in our portfolio with rooftop solar panels. Water Management Description of water management risks and discussion of strategies and practices to mitigate those risks IF-RE-140a.4 We integrate water reduction measures on all new developments and renovation, incorporating LEED certification or applicable aspects of our own sustainability policies/programs. These measures include the use of WaterSense\u00ae fixtures for all domestic usage, xeriscaping to minimize or eliminate the need for irrigation, and water usage monitoring, where available and appropriate. Climate Change Adaptation Area of properties located in 100-year flood zones, by property subsector IF-RE-450a.1 10.8 million square feet. \nAs of December 31, 2020, we have total future payment obligations of $225.2 million on our ground leases and $27.9 million on our office leases and other lease arrangements, over their non-cancellable lease period including applicable lease extension and renewal options when deemed reasonably certain of exercise. See Note 14 to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nThe General Partner has an ATM equity program that allows it to issue new common shares from time to time, with an aggregate offering price of up to $400.0 million. During the three months ended December 31, 2020, the General Partner issued 1.7 million common shares under its ATM equity program, resulting in net proceeds of $65.9 million after paying total compensation of $666,000 to the applicable sales agents. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the General Partner issued 4.6 million common shares under its ATM equity program, generating net proceeds of $175.0 million after paying total compensation of $1.8 million to the applicable sales agents. Other fees related to these issuances, totaling $344,000, were also paid during the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the ATM equity program still had $13.4 million worth of new common shares available to issue.\nSale of Real Estate Assets\n\u2022Income from continuing operations before income taxes was $297.5 million and $440.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(2) We capitalized $6.5 million and $28.8 million of our total overhead costs to leasing and development, respectively, for consolidated properties during 2020, compared to capitalizing $6.8 million and $24.2 million of such costs, respectively, for 2019. Non-capitalizable leasing costs were $12.3 million and $12.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (these costs are presented separately in the line item \"Non-Incremental Costs Related to Successful Leases\" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations). Combined overhead costs capitalized to leasing and development totaled 26.7% and 22.8% of our overall pool of overhead costs for 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nGeneral contractor and service fee revenue, and general contractor and other service expenses, decreased as the result of lower third party construction volume during 2020.\nHistorical Cash Flows\nThe purchase price of real estate assets is also allocated to intangible assets consisting of the above or below market component of in-place leases and the value of in-place leases. The value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in-place lease is determined based upon the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be received pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and (ii) management's estimate of the amounts that would be received using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease. The amounts allocated to above market leases are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and below market leases are included in other liabilities in the balance sheet; both are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. Factors considered in determining the value allocable to in-place leases include estimates, during hypothetical lease up periods, related to space that is actually leased at the time of acquisition. These estimates include (i) lost rent at market rates, (ii) fixed operating costs that will be recovered from tenants and (iii) theoretical leasing commissions required to execute similar leases. These intangible assets are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and are amortized over the remaining term of the existing lease.\nBuilding Dispositions\n\u2022Increased occupancy and rental rates within our \"same-property\" portfolio, as well as the lease up of properties that were placed in service prior to January 1, 2019 but were not in the \"same-property\" portfolio, also contributed to the increase to rental and related revenue from continuing operations.\nBusiness Overview\nService Operations primarily consist of the development, construction management and general contractor services, leasing, property management and asset management for unconsolidated joint venture properties and properties owned by third parties. Service Operations are heavily influenced by the current state of the economy, as construction and development services rely on the expansion of business operations of third-party property owners and joint venture partners, while leasing and property management fees are dependent upon occupancy.\nWe sold 28 properties during 2019 that were classified in continuing operations, recognizing total gains on sale of $234.7 million. These properties did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.\n\u2022We placed 18 newly completed consolidated development projects in service, which totaled 6.8 million square feet with total costs of $693.8 million at December 31, 2020. These properties were 93.7% leased at December 31, 2020. Two newly completed projects owned by unconsolidated joint ventures were also placed in service, totaling 491,000 square feet with total costs of $27.6 million (square feet and costs shown at 100%), during 2020. These properties were 100% leased at December 31, 2020.\nDuring 2020, we repaid one fixed rate secured loan of $9.0 million, which had a stated interest rate of 5.61%.\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $67.2 million, $121.4 million and $25.5 million at December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The following table highlights significant changes in net cash associated with our operating, investing and financing activities (in thousands):\n\u2022The sale of 35 in-service properties since January 1, 2019, which did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations, resulted in a decrease of $23.3 million to rental and related revenue from continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 2019, which partially offset the aforementioned increases to rental and related revenue from continuing operations.\n\u2022We acquired 16 properties and placed 36 wholly owned developments in service from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020, which provided incremental revenues from continuing operations of $66.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to 2019.\nWe utilized the capital generated from dispositions during the year to reduce debt and to fund our development activities. Highlights of our key financing activities are as follows:\nmillion, compared to net income of $432.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in net income in 2020 for the General Partner and the Partnership, when compared to 2019, was primarily the result of lower gains on property sales and higher losses on debt extinguishment during 2020.\nTenant improvements and lease-related costs pertaining to our initial leasing of newly completed space, or vacant space in acquired properties, are referred to as first generation expenditures. Such first generation expenditures for tenant improvements are included within \"development of real estate investments\" in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, while such expenditures for capitalizable lease-related costs are included within \"other deferred leasing costs.\"\n\nDevelopment\nSame-Property Net Operating Income - Cash Basis\nIn addition to our environmental initiatives, we are committed to fair compensation, fostering a dynamic and balanced work environment and providing employees with developmental opportunities to perform well and derive satisfaction from their work. We encourage our associates to participate in volunteer and community activities and support those who do participate by providing each associate with two paid community days per year. We also have charitable contribution programs, such as our dollars for doers program (matching dollars for volunteer hours spent) and our matching gifts program (matching dollars for employee donations to charities). In addition, we partner with various charitable organizations, including the American Red Cross since 2017. We maintain a formal and structured diversity, equity and inclusion program. We have increased diversity within our board of directors and 50% of the Independent Directors of the board are female or people of color. We implemented a Vendor Code of Conduct that outlines our expectations and standards for how our vendors operate while doing business on our behalf. Through all of these initiatives and others, we endeavor to make a positive impact on the communities in which we conduct business.\nWe are exposed to capital market risk, such as changes in interest rates. In order to reduce the volatility relating to interest rate risk, we may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements from time to time. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had on file with the SEC an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 relating to the offer and sale, from time to time, of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities (including guarantees of the Partnership's debt securities by the General Partner). Equity securities are offered and sold by the General Partner, and the net proceeds of such offerings are contributed to the Partnership in exchange for additional General Partner Units or Preferred Units. From time to time, we expect to issue additional securities under this automatic shelf registration statement to fund the repayment of debt, to fund development and future acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes.\nThe table below reflects our consolidated in-service portfolio lease expiration schedule at December 31, 2020 (in thousands, except percentage data and number of leases):\nInvesting Activities\n\u2022property investment;\nThe pandemic's impact on the overall global economy is continuing and the ultimate impact cannot be predicted at this time. Please see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" for additional information about the potential impacts the pandemic may have on our business and results of operations.\n\u2022In February 2020, a consolidated joint venture of the Partnership obtained a secured loan from a third party financial institution for gross proceeds of $18.4 million. No secured loans were obtained in 2019 or 2018.\nGuarantee Obligations\nCost Capitalization: Direct and certain indirect costs, including interest, clearly associated with the development, construction or expansion of real estate investments are capitalized as a cost of the property.\nDebt Extinguishment\nOur operating results depend primarily upon rental income from our Rental Operations. The following discussion highlights the metrics that drive the performance of our Rental Operations, which management uses to operate the business, and that we consider to be critical drivers of future revenues.\nCash flows from Rental Operations is our primary source of liquidity and provides a stable source of cash flow to fund operational expenses. We believe that this cash-based revenue stream is substantially aligned with revenue recognition (except for items such as periodic straight-line rental income accruals and amortization of above or below market rents) as cash receipts from the leasing of rental properties are generally received in advance of, or a short time following, the actual revenue recognition.\nOverview\nIn addition to NAREIT FFO we use (i) Property Level Net Operating Income - Cash Basis (\"PNOI\") and (ii) Same-Property Net Operating Income - Cash Basis (\"SPNOI\") as supplemental non-GAAP performance measures. Management believes that the use of PNOI and SPNOI combined with net income (which remains the primary measure of performance), improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and makes comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. The most comparable GAAP measure to PNOI and SPNOI is income from continuing operations before income taxes.\nSupplemental Performance Measures\n\u2022In 2019, we paid off a special assessment bond for $9.9 million, which was reflected within Other Financing Activities on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We did not make similar significant repayments during 2020 or 2018.\nOur decision process in determining whether or not to acquire a property or portfolio of properties involves several factors, including expected rent growth, multiple yield metrics, property locations and expected demographic growth in each location, current occupancy of the properties, tenant profile and remaining terms of the in-place leases in the properties. It is difficult to predict which markets may present acquisition opportunities that align with our strategy. Because of the numerous factors considered in our acquisition decisions, we do not establish specific target yields for future acquisitions.\nThe increase to cash flow provided by operating activities between 2019 and 2018 was due to the timing of cash receipts and cash payments on third party construction projects as well as increased cash flows from our Rental Operations. These increases in operating cash flows were partially offset by increased cash paid for interest and income taxes as well as the timing of working capital.\n\nResults of Operations\nTransactions with unconsolidated joint ventures also provide a source of liquidity. From time to time we will sell properties to unconsolidated joint ventures, while retaining a continuing interest in that entity, and receive proceeds commensurate to those interests that we do not own. Additionally, unconsolidated joint ventures will from time to time obtain debt financing or sell properties and will then distribute to us, and our joint venture partners, all or a portion of the proceeds from such transactions. There were no material transactions with unconsolidated joint ventures in 2020.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe Partnership's unsecured line of credit has an interest rate that is indexed to LIBOR. In 2017, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\"ARRC\") proposed that the Secured Overnight Funding Rate (\"SOFR\") replace LIBOR. ARRC also proposed that the transition to SOFR from LIBOR take place by the end of 2021. As the Partnership's unsecured line of credit agreement has provisions that allow for automatic transition to a new rate and the Partnership has no other material debt arrangements that are indexed to LIBOR, we believe that the transition will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n\u2022During 2020, the General Partner issued 4.6 million common shares pursuant to its ATM equity programs for net proceeds of $175.0 million, compared to 8.0 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $263.3 million in 2019 and 990,400 shares of common stock for net proceeds of $28.4 million in 2018.\nThe following table summarizes our second generation capital expenditures by type of expenditure, as well as capital expenditures for the development of real estate investments and for other deferred leasing costs (in thousands):\nLeasing/Capital Costs\nDepreciation and amortization expense from continuing operations was $353.0 million and $327.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily the result of continued growth in our portfolio through development and acquisitions placed in service from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020, partially offset by the impact of property sales that did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.\n\u2022During 2020, we repaid one fixed rate secured loan, totaling $9.0 million, which had a stated interest rate of 5.61%.\nDebt Service and Maturities\n\u2022We paid cash of $632.1 million, $598.4 million and $592.4 million, for real estate and undeveloped land acquisitions during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\n\u2022We increased net borrowings on the Partnership's unsecured line of credit by $295.0 million in 2020, decreased net borrowings by $30.0 million in 2019 and increased net borrowings by $30.0 million in 2018.\nIn assessing the amount of indirect costs to be capitalized, we first allocate payroll costs, on a department-by-department basis, among activities for which capitalization is warranted (i.e., construction and development and leasing) and those for which capitalization is not warranted (i.e., property management, maintenance, acquisitions, dispositions, non-incremental leasing costs and general corporate functions). To the extent the employees of a department split their time between capitalizable and non-capitalizable activities, the allocations are made based on estimates of the actual amount of time spent in each activity. Once the payroll costs are allocated, the non-payroll costs of each department are allocated among the capitalizable and non-capitalizable activities in the same proportion as payroll costs.\nDividend and Distribution Requirements\n\u2022The total estimated cost of our properties under construction at December 31, 2020, with costs for unconsolidated properties shown at 100%, totaled $1.10 billion, with $690.1 million of such costs already incurred. The total estimated cost for the one unconsolidated joint venture property under construction at December 31, 2020 was $57.0 million, with $22.6 million of such costs already incurred. The consolidated properties under construction were 64.5% pre-leased, while the unconsolidated joint venture property under construction was 100% pre-leased.\nRental Expenses and Real Estate Taxes\nGrowth in average annual net effective rents for new second generation and renewal leases, on a combined basis, for our consolidated and unconsolidated rental properties, is as follows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\u2022We paid regular cash dividends or distributions of $0.96, $0.88 and $0.815 per common share or per Common Unit during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nPNOI and SPNOI each exclude expenses that materially impact our overall results of operations and, therefore, should not be considered as a substitute for income from continuing operations before income taxes, or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Furthermore, these metrics may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe following table sets forth the components of net earnings from the Service Operations reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively (in thousands):\nDuring 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have made various changes to our operations in order to support the health and safety of our associates and the communities in which we operate. Throughout the pandemic, accelerated e-commerce demand drove strong leasing activity, while the pandemic also negatively impacted a relatively small portion of our tenant base that operate in lines of business, such as event planning, that were most acutely impacted by COVID-19. Through December 31, 2020, we executed deferral agreements with certain customers that allowed for $7.4 million of total scheduled rental payments to be deferred and repaid in future periods. The substantial majority of these agreements were short term in nature and required repayment of the deferred amounts within twelve months of their execution. We have collected all amounts due under such short term rent deferral agreements through the end of 2020. We temporarily paused our acquisition, disposition and development activities at the onset of the pandemic but such activities were resumed at an accelerated pace during the second half of the year.\n(3) The decrease in allocation of costs to Service Operations and Rental Operations resulted from a lower volume of third-party construction projects during 2020.\nOur business operations primarily consist of two reportable operating segments: rental operations of industrial properties and service operations. Rental operations of industrial properties represent the ownership and development of industrial properties and is the primary component of our revenues and earnings. Service operations generate additional revenues from providing various real estate services primarily relating to development, construction management and property management services to customers, unconsolidated joint ventures and third-party owners.\n\nNationwide demand for industrial properties continues to be strong in the current economic environment as the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated both consumer acceptance of e-commerce and the requirements of many retailers to increase inventory levels. Our operational focus is to maintain occupancy at high levels and to focus on rental rate growth. The occupancy of our consolidated industrial portfolio increased to 97.4% at December 31, 2020 as compared to 96.6% at December 31, 2019. Our annual net effective rents for both renewals and new second generation leases, on a combined basis, for consolidated properties grew 28.2% in 2020 compared to 2019. In the current environment of rising rental rates for industrial properties in many of the markets in which we operate, we believe there is potential for continued future rental rate growth to the extent we are able to renew or backfill expiring leases and maintain high levels of occupancy.\nOur unsecured line of credit at December 31, 2020 is described as follows (in thousands):\nIn June 2020, we repurchased and canceled $216.3 million of unsecured notes that were scheduled to mature in October 2022 pursuant to a tender offer completed by the Partnership.\nOur overall strategy is to increase our investment in quality industrial properties primarily through development, on both a speculative and build-to-suit basis, supplemented with acquisitions in the markets we believe have the highest growth potential.\nProperty Investment\nA summary of our operating results and property statistics for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, is as follows (in thousands, except number of properties and per share or per Common Unit data):\nAsset Strategy\nOccupancy Analysis\nLease Commitments\n\u2022We started new development projects with expected total costs of $795.6 million, which included $78.0 million of expected total costs for development projects started within two unconsolidated joint ventures. The development projects started in 2020 were, in aggregate, 62.0% leased at December 31, 2020.\nOur operational focus is to drive profitability by maximizing cash from operations as well as NAREIT FFO through (i) maintaining property occupancy, increasing rental rates and prioritizing timely collection of monthly rental payments, while also keeping lease-related capital costs contained, by effectively managing our portfolio of existing properties; (ii) selectively developing new build-to-suit, substantially pre-leased and, in select markets, speculative development projects; and (iii) providing a full line of real estate services to our tenants and to third parties.\nsecond generation and renewal leases, on a combined basis, executed for consolidated and unconsolidated joint venture properties during the year resulted in 28.2% and 33.8%, respectively, increases to net effective rents (\"net effective rents\" is defined hereafter in the \"Key Performance Indicators\" section) when compared to the previous leases of the same space.\nOperating Activities\nIn February 2020, a consolidated joint venture obtained an $18.4 million secured loan from a third party financial institution, with a fixed annual interest rate of 3.41% and a maturity date of March 1, 2035.\n\nWe regularly work to identify, consider and pursue opportunities to dispose of properties in a manner that is generally consistent with our strategic plans. Our ability to dispose of such properties on favorable terms, or at all, is dependent upon a number of factors including the availability of credit to potential buyers to purchase properties at prices that we consider acceptable. Although we believe that we have demonstrated our ability to generate significant liquidity through the disposition of non-strategic properties, potential future adverse changes to general market and economic conditions, including the uncertain economic outlook caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, could negatively impact our further ability to dispose of such properties.\nBoth our first and second generation expenditures vary significantly between leases on a per square foot basis, dependent upon several factors including the nature of a tenant's operations, the specific physical characteristics of each individual property and the market in which the property is located.\nFinancing Activities\n\u2022other contractual obligations.\nWe had 7.4 million square feet of property under development with total estimated costs upon completion of $1.10 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to 8.9 million square feet with total estimated costs upon completion of $1.06 billion at December 31, 2019. The square footage and estimated costs include both consolidated properties and unconsolidated joint venture development activity at 100%.\nWe expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements over the next 12 months, which include payments of dividends and distributions, completion of development projects that are currently under construction and the capital expenditures needed to maintain our current real estate assets, through working capital, net cash provided by operating activities and short term borrowings on the Partnership's unsecured line of credit. We had $295.0 million outstanding borrowings on the Partnership's $1.20 billion unsecured line of credit, had $6.3 million of cash on hand and held $47.7 million of restricted cash in escrow for future like kind exchange transactions at December 31, 2020.\nOur ability to maintain and improve occupancy and net effective rents primarily depends upon our continuing ability to lease vacant space. The volume and quality of our leasing activity is closely scrutinized by management in operation of the business and provides useful information regarding future performance. The initial leasing of development projects or vacant space in acquired properties is referred to as first generation lease activity. The leasing of such space that we have previously held under lease to a tenant is referred to as second generation lease activity. Second generation lease activity may be in the form of renewals of existing leases or new second generation leases of previously leased space. The total leasing activity for our consolidated and unconsolidated industrial rental properties, expressed in square feet of leases signed, is as follows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nVacancy Activity\n\u2022dividends and distributions to shareholders and unitholders;\nFinancial Instruments\nCash expenditures related to the construction of a building's shell, as well as the associated site improvements, are also included within \"development of real estate investments\" in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nThe composition of the line items titled \"Rental Operations revenues and expenses excluded from PNOI\" and \"Non-Segment Items\" from the table above are shown in greater detail in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report.\nDuring 2020, we redeemed $300.0 million of unsecured notes with a stated interest rate of 4.38% and repurchased and canceled $216.3 million of unsecured notes with a stated interest rate of 3.88% pursuant to a tender offer completed by the Partnership. In connection with redemption and repurchase of these unsecured notes, we recognized a total loss of $32.9 million including the redemption/repayment premium and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.\nOccupancy is an important metric for management and our investors for understanding our financial performance. Our ability to maintain high occupancy rates is among the principal drivers of maintaining and increasing rental revenue. The following table sets forth percent leased and average net effective rent information regarding our in-service portfolio of rental properties at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively:\nLease Expirations\n\nDebt outstanding at December 31, 2020 had a face value totaling $3.41 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 3.17% and maturities at various dates through 2050. Of this total amount, we had $3.06 billion of unsecured debt, $60.6 million of secured debt and $295.0 million outstanding borrowings on our unsecured line of credit at December 31, 2020. Scheduled principal amortization, maturities and early repayments of such debt totaled $529.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nSales of land and properties provided $336.3 million in net proceeds in 2020, compared to $432.7 million in 2019 and $511.4 million in 2018.\n\u2022We acquired ten industrial properties during the year ended December 31, 2020 with a total asset value of $424.9 million.\n\nIn October 2018, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board issued the Real Estate Sustainability Accounting Standards. The standards are intended to provide a minimum set of sustainability metrics for disclosure in SEC filings, such as this Form 10-K. We understand the importance of reporting comparable, consistent and financially material sustainability metrics. Below is a chart showing our information for the applicable metrics.\n\u2022leasing/capital costs;\nIn March 2020, we redeemed $300.0 million of unsecured notes that were scheduled to mature in June 2022.\n\u2022The Partnership repaid one secured loan for $9.0 million during 2020, compared to repayments of three secured loans for $41.7 million in 2019 and three secured loans for $227.1 million in 2018.\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist of two components. The first component includes general corporate expenses, and the second component represents the indirect operating costs not allocated to, or absorbed by, either the development, leasing and operation of our consolidated properties or our Service Operations. Such indirect operating costs are primarily comprised of employee compensation, including related costs such as benefits and wage-related taxes, but also include other ancillary costs such as travel and information technology support. Total indirect operating costs, prior to any allocation or absorption, and general corporate expenses are collectively referred to as our overall pool of overhead costs.\nYear in Review\nWe sold seven properties during 2020 that were classified in continuing operations, recognizing total gains on sale of $127.7 million. These properties did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.\nWe regularly work to identify, consider and pursue opportunities to dispose of properties on an opportunistic basis and on a basis that is generally consistent with our strategic plans. Dispositions of properties is a source of capital to fund future investment.\nOur capital strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet by actively managing the components of our capital structure in coordination with the execution of our overall operational and asset strategies. We are focused on maintaining our current investment grade ratings from our credit rating agencies. As of December 31, 2020, our senior unsecured notes have been assigned a rating of Baa1 by Moody's Investors Services and BBB+ by Standard & Poor's Ratings Group and we are focused on maintaining such ratings in order to maintain access to liquidity. A securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules of this report and the matters described under Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nCapital Strategy\nAt December 31, 2020, we:\nTotal Leasing Activity\nWe define our \"same-property\" population once a year at the beginning of the current calendar year and include buildings that were stabilized (the term \"stabilized\" means properties that have reached 90% leased or that have been in-service for at least one year since development completion or acquisition) as of January 1 of the prior calendar year. The \"same-property\" pool is also adjusted to remove properties that were sold subsequent to the beginning of the current calendar year. As such, the \"same-property\" population for the period ended December 31, 2020 includes all properties that we owned or jointly controlled at January 1, 2020, which had both been owned or jointly controlled and had reached stabilization by January 1, 2019, and have not been sold.\nThe following table sets forth rental expenses and real estate taxes from continuing operations (in thousands):\nOverall, real estate tax expense from continuing operations increased by $19.8 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase to real estate taxes was mainly the result of acquisitions and developments placed in service from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020, which have generally been concentrated in markets with higher tax rates and/or assessed values, and increased tax assessments in certain of our markets. These increases were partially offset by the impact of property sales that did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.\n\nIn January 2021, we issued $450.0 million of senior unsecured notes with a stated interest rate of 1.75%, which will mature on February 1, 2031. These notes are our second green bond issuance with the first issuance completed in November 2019. The net proceeds will be used to finance future or refinance recently completed eligible green projects\u201d. These projects may include green buildings, energy efficiency projects, sustainable water and wastewater management systems, renewable energy projects, clean transportation solutions and pollution prevention and control.\nInterest expense allocable to continuing operations was $93.4 million and $89.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in interest expense from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was largely the result of increased overall borrowings and lower capitalization of interest expense, partially offset by lower average interest rates during 2020 as the result of refinancing certain of our unsecured notes.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nImpairment of Real Estate Assets: We evaluate our real estate assets, with the exception of those that are classified as held-for-sale, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If such an evaluation is considered necessary, we compare the carrying amount of that real estate asset, or asset group, with the expected undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with, and that are expected to arise as a direct result of, the use and eventual disposition of that asset, or asset group. Our estimate of the expected future cash flows used in testing for impairment is based on, among other things, our estimates regarding future market conditions, rental rates, occupancy levels, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other tenant concessions, assumptions regarding the residual value of our properties at the end of our anticipated holding period and the length of our anticipated holding period and is, therefore, subjective by nature. These assumptions could differ materially from actual results. If our strategy changes or if market conditions otherwise dictate a reduction in the holding period and an earlier sale date, an impairment loss could be recognized and such loss could be material. To the extent the carrying amount of a real estate asset, or asset group, exceeds the associated estimate of undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its fair value.\nRental and Related Revenue\nIn support of our capital strategy, we employ an asset disposition program to sell certain real estate assets, which generate proceeds that can be recycled into new property investments that better fit our growth objectives or otherwise manage our capital structure.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nWe had consolidated properties under development with an expected total cost of $1.04 billion at December 31, 2020, compared to projects with an expected cost of $1.05 billion and $709.7 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We had $374.9 million of remaining costs to complete for consolidated properties under development at December 31, 2020.\n\u2022opportunistic repurchases of outstanding debt; and\n\n\u2022We receive capital distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures, either as the result of selling our ownership interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures or from our share of the proceeds from property sales from unconsolidated joint ventures. In 2020, we received $876,000 in capital distributions primarily from one unconsolidated joint venture from the sale of land. We received $26.3 million in capital distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures during 2019, primarily related to the sale of three properties within three of our unconsolidated joint ventures. We received $23.1 million in capital distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures during 2018, primarily related to the sale of six properties within three of our unconsolidated joint ventures.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2020 to Year Ended December 31, 2019\n\u2022We generated $336.3 million of total net cash proceeds from the disposition of seven consolidated buildings and 157 acres of wholly owned undeveloped land.\n\u2022The increase in rental revenue was also partially offset by a $4.0 million increase in collectability reserves for contractual and straight-line receivables, primarily as a result of current economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.\nAlso in February 2020, we issued $325.0 million of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at a stated interest rate of 3.05%, have an effective interest of 3.19%, and mature on March 1, 2050, for gross proceeds of $316.4 million.\nThe General Partner and Partnership collectively specialize in the ownership, management and development of industrial real estate. The General Partner is a self-administered and self-managed REIT that began operations in 1986 and is the sole general partner of the Partnership. The Partnership is a limited partnership formed in 1993, at which time all of the properties and related assets and liabilities of the General Partner, as well as proceeds from a secondary offering of the General Partner's common shares, were contributed to the Partnership. Simultaneously, the Partnership completed the acquisition of Duke Associates, a full-service commercial real estate firm operating in the Midwest whose operations began in 1972. We operate the General Partner and the Partnership as one enterprise, and therefore, our discussion and analysis refers to the General Partner and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Partnership, collectively.\nNAREIT FFO attributable to common shareholders of the General Partner totaled $521.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $510.5 million for 2019. NAREIT FFO attributable to common unitholders of the Partnership totaled $526.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $514.9 million for 2019. The increase to NAREIT FFO from 2019 for the General Partner and the Partnership was primarily driven by improved occupancy, rental rate growth and new developments being placed into service and leased up, partially offset by debt extinguishment costs recognized during 2020.\n\u2022We made capital contributions and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures in the amounts of $6.2 million, $34.5 million and $5.9 million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe capital expenditures in the table above include the capitalization of internal overhead costs. We capitalized $6.5 million, $6.8 million and $19.0 million of overhead costs that are incremental to executing leases, including both first and second generation leases, during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We capitalized $28.8 million, $24.2 million and $29.8 million of overhead costs related to development activities, including both development and tenant improvement projects on first and second generation space, during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Combined overhead costs capitalized to leasing and development totaled 26.7%, 22.8% and 35.1% of our overall pool of overhead costs at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in the overhead costs capitalized to leasing for 2020 and 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to the expense impact of internal costs related to successful leasing which were not capitalizable as a result of the adoption of the new lease standard on January 1, 2019 (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report) and was included in the line item \"Non-incremental costs related to successful leases\" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for 2020 and 2019.\nWe believe that the factors that impact SPNOI are generally the same as those that impact PNOI. The following table details the number of properties, square feet, average commencement occupancy and average cash rental rate for the properties included in SPNOI for the respective periods:\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Certain estimates, judgments and assumptions are inherently subjective and based on the existing business and market conditions, and are therefore continually evaluated based upon available information and experience. Based on the nature of our business, current economic conditions and the value of our real estate assets, we have concluded that our financial statements for all periods presented have not been materially impacted by individual accounts or classes of transaction that rely on estimates. Further, we have concluded that our financial statements for all periods presented are not materially impacted by estimates of fair value that rely upon non-observable inputs.", "item_7_tables": "Table 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75,345 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>74,083 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-reportable Rental Operations and non-segment expenses </td> <td>1,294 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,501 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total rental expenses from continuing operations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>76,639 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75,584 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate taxes: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial </td> <td>$ </td> <td>148,252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>128,887 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-reportable Rental Operations and non-segment expenses </td> <td>1,043 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>633 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total real estate tax expense from continuing operations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>149,295 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>129,520 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>Table 39: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second generation tenant improvements </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,165 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,797 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second generation leasing costs </td> <td>19,870 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,899 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Building improvements </td> <td>4,103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,505 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,778 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total second generation capital expenditures </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,099 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,549 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,474 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Development of real estate investments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>573,544 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>446,801 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>577,383 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other deferred leasing costs </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,545 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,509 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,380 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>Table 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses -

It operates as a REIT.\n\n- Net income attributable to common shareholders decreased in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower gains on property sales and higher losses on debt extinguishment. \n\n- Rental and related revenue increased in 2020 compared to 2019, driven by occupancy growth, rental rate increases, newly developed properties, and acquisitions. This was partially offset by property sales.\n\n- The company continues to focus on industrial property investments through development and selective acquisitions. It resumed development projects in the second half of 2020 after a pandemic-related pause.\n\n- Capital recycling through property dispositions generated proceeds to reduce debt and fund developments. The company also issued equity and debt to fund growth.\n\n- Total leasing activity decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 but rental rates on renewals and new leases increased substantially.\n\n- The company has focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment grade credit ratings.\n\nIn summary, the company continued executing its industrial property investment strategy in 2020 despite pandemic challenges, improving portfolio metrics like occupancy and rental rates. It maintains a solid balance sheet to fund future growth opportunities."}
