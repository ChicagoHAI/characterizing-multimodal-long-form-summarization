Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results \tof Operations\n(Dollar amounts, except per share amounts, are expressed in thousands unless otherwise noted)\nThe purpose of this discussion is to focus on significant changes in the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its subsidiary, Georgia Bank & Trust Company of Augusta ( GB&T\u201d), during the past three years. The discussion and analysis is intended to supplement and highlight information contained in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nOverview\nThe Company's services include the origination of residential and commercial real estate loans, construction and development loans, and commercial and consumer loans. The Company also offers a variety of deposit programs, including noninterest-bearing demand, interest checking, money management, savings, and time deposits. In the Augusta-Richmond County, GA-SC metropolitan statistical area, the Company had 19.45% of all deposits and was the second largest depository institution and the largest locally based institution at June 30, 2015 based on deposit levels, as cited from the FDIC's website. Securities sold under repurchase agreements are also offered. Additional services include wealth management, trust, retail investment, and mortgage. As a matter of practice, most mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market; however, some mortgage loans are placed in the portfolio based on asset/liability management strategies. The Company continues to concentrate on increasing its market share through various new deposit and loan products and other financial services and by focusing on its customer relationship management philosophy. The Company is committed to building lifelong relationships with its customers, employees, shareholders, and the communities it serves.\nNet income in 2015 was $19,395 compared to $16,632 in 2014. Earnings were positively impacted by a $1,628 credit for loan losses, primarily due to the repayment of a previously written down impaired loan during the second quarter of 2015 that resulted in a $1,666 recovery. In addition, net interest income increased $2,193 and gain on sales of loans increased $1,130. These increases were partially offset by a $2,552 increase in noninterest expense and investment securities losses of $1,043 compared to gains of $825 in the prior year.\nThe Company's primary source of income is from its lending activities followed by interest income from its investment activities, service charges and fees on deposits, and gain on sales of mortgage loans in the secondary market. Despite declining yields, interest income on loans increased slightly due to increased volumes in the loan portfolio. Interest income on investment securities increased $916 or 6.34% due to increased volume and yields. In addition, gain on sales of mortgage loans increased $1,130 or 20.68% due to increased mortgage originations and refinancing activity in 2015.\nThe Company continues to focus on the net interest margin, regulatory capital requirements, liquidity management, risk mitigation and expense control. Problem asset resolution, new consumer disclosure regulations, upgrades to operating systems, balance sheet management and investment purchases have been key areas of focus in 2015.\nOver the past four years, assets grew $225,592 from $1,614,773 at December 31, 2011 to $1,840,365 at December 31, 2015. From year end 2011 to year end 2015, deposits increased $109,858, and loans increased $163,139. Net interest income for the year ended 2011 was $50,562 compared to net interest income of $54,257 in 2015. On April 24, 2013, the Company reinstated quarterly cash dividends of $0.13 per share. On January 14, 2015, the Company increased the cash dividend to $0.15 per share and on January 20, 2016 increased quarterly cash dividends to $0.16 per share.\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company meets its liquidity needs by managing cash and due from banks, federal funds purchased and sold, maturity of investment securities, principal repayments received from mortgage-backed securities, and draws on lines of credit. Additionally, liquidity can be managed through structuring deposit and loan maturities. The Company funds loan and investment growth with core deposits, securities sold under repurchase agreements, Federal Home Loan Bank advances and other wholesale funding including brokered certificates of deposit. During inflationary periods, interest rates generally increase and operating expenses generally rise. When interest rates rise, variable rate loans and investments produce higher earnings; however, deposit and other borrowings interest expense also rise. The Company monitors its interest rate risk as it applies to net interest income in various simulations up and down 400 basis points (4.00%) and as it applies to economic value of equity in a shock up and down 400 basis points (4.00%) scenario. The Company monitors operating expenses through responsibility center budgeting. See -Interest Rate Sensitivity\u201d below.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe accounting and financial reporting policies of the Company and its subsidiary conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and to general practices within the banking industry. Of these policies, management has identified the allowance for loan losses, determining the fair values of financial instruments including other real estate owned, interest rate swap derivatives, investment securities, and other-than-temporary impairment as critical accounting estimates that requires difficult, subjective judgment and are important to the presentation of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, which affects the Company's earnings directly. Loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance. The allowance is an amount that reflects management's estimate of the level of probable incurred losses in the portfolio. Factors considered by management in determining the adequacy of the allowance include, but are not limited to: (1) detailed reviews of individual loans; (2) historical and current trends in loan charge-offs for the various portfolio segments evaluated; (3) the level of the allowance in relation to total loans and to historical loss levels; (4) levels and trends in non-performing and past due loans; (5) collateral values of properties securing loans; and (6) management's assessment of economic conditions. The Company's Board of Directors reviews the recommendations of management regarding the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses based upon these factors.\nThe provision for loan losses is the charge to operating earnings necessary to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses. The Company has developed policies and procedures for evaluating the overall quality of its loan portfolio and the timely identification of problem credits. Management continues to review these policies and procedures and makes further improvements as needed. The adequacy of the Company's allowance for loan losses and the effectiveness of the Company's internal policies and procedures are also reviewed periodically by the Company's regulators and the Company's internal loan review personnel. The Company's regulators may advise the Company to recognize additions to the allowance based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. Such regulatory guidance is considered, and the Company may recognize additions to the allowance as a result.\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>34 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company continues to refine the methodology on which the level of the allowance for loan losses is based, by comparing historical loss ratios utilized to actual experience and by classifying loans for analysis based on similar risk characteristics. Cash receipts for accruing loans are applied to principal and interest under the contractual terms of the loan agreement; however, cash receipts on impaired and nonaccrual loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are applied to principal and interest income depending upon the overall risk of principal loss to the Company.\nPlease see Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d and Non-Performing Assets\u201d for a further discussion of the Company's loans, loss experience, and methodology in determining the allowance.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nA significant portion of the Company's assets are financial instruments carried at fair value. This includes securities available-for-sale, loans held for sale, certain impaired loans, mortgage banking derivatives and other real estate owned. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 the percentage of total assets measured at fair value was 39.16% and 38.95%, respectively. The majority of assets carried at fair value are based on either quoted market prices or market prices for similar instruments. At December 31, 2015, 1.46% of assets measured at fair value were based on significant unobservable inputs. This consisted primarily of impaired loans and other real estate owned. This represents approximately 0.57% of the Company's total assets. See Note 6 Fair Value Measurements\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d herein for additional disclosures regarding the fair value of financial instruments.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nAssets acquired through or instead of loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. These assets are subsequently accounted for at lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. If fair value declines subsequent to foreclosure, a valuation allowance is recorded through expense. Operating costs after acquisition are expensed. Costs related to the development and improvement of real estate owned are capitalized.\nInterest Rate Swap Derivatives\nThe fair value of interest rate swap derivatives is determined based on discounted cash flow valuation models using observable market data as of the measurement date. The fair value adjustment is included in other liabilities. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d herein for additional disclosures regarding the fair value of financial instruments.\nInvestment Securities\nThe fair values for available-for-sale securities are generally based upon quoted market prices or observable market prices for similar instruments. These values take into account recent market activity as well as other market observable data such as interest rate, spread and prepayment information. When market observable data is not available, which generally occurs due to the lack of liquidity for certain securities, the valuation of the security is subjective and may involve substantial judgment. The Company conducts periodic reviews to identify and evaluate each available-for-sale security that has an unrealized loss for other-than-temporary impairment. An unrealized loss exists when the fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis. The primary factors the Company considers in determining whether an impairment is other-than-temporary are the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer and whether the Company intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had no securities valued using unobservable inputs (Level 3).\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations\nThe Company recorded net income of $19,395 in 2015 compared to $16,632 in 2014. The increase in net income is primarily attributable to a credit for loan losses of $1,628 compared to a provision for loan losses of $3,492 in 2014. In addition, net interest income increased $2,193 and gain on sales of loans increased $1,130. Partially offsetting these were a $2,552 increase in noninterest expense and investment securities losses of $1,043 compared to a gain of $825 in the prior year.\nInterest income increased $1,534 or 2.52% to $62,484 in 2015. Interest income on tax-exempt investment securities increased $548 or 21.31% primarily due to an increase in average balance of $21,793 or 25.88%. Interest income on taxable investment securities increased $368 or 3.10% in 2015 caused primarily by an increase in yield. The average rate on taxable investments increased from 2.09% in 2014 to 2.16% in 2015, an increase of 7 basis points. Interest income on loans increased $447 from 2014 due to an increase in average balance partially offset by a decline in yield. Average loans increased from $942,636 in 2014 to $966,651 in 2015, an increase of $24,015 or 2.55%. The average rate on loans dropped from 4.86% in 2014 to 4.79% in 2015, a decrease of 7 basis points.\nInterest expense decreased $659 or 7.42% to $8,227 in 2015. Interest expense on deposits decreased $462 or 7.39% to $5,790 and was due primarily to declines in rates paid on deposits and a $22,278 decline in average time deposits. Due to the low interest rate environment many customers have transferred out of time deposits to more liquid NOW and savings accounts. Brokered CDs decreased $28,914 or 15.37% and totaled $159,180 at year end 2015.\nNoninterest income decreased $342 in 2015 and was due primarily to investment securities losses of $1,043, partially offset by increased gain on sales of loans of $1,130. Also offsetting the investment losses were increased service charges and deposit fees of $135, trust service fees, which increased $98, and cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance, which increased $96.\nNoninterest expense increased $2,552 or 5.87% in 2015 mostly due to a $1,337 increase in salaries and other personnel expense and a $955 prepayment penalty fee on an FHLB Advance. The operating efficiency ratio increased from 61.78% in 2014 to 62.29% in 2015.\nThe earnings performance of the Company is reflected in its return on average assets and average equity of 1.08% and 11.87%, respectively, during 2015 compared to 0.96% and 11.49%, respectively, during 2014. Basic and diluted net income per share on weighted average common shares outstanding increased to $2.89 in 2015 compared to $2.49 in 2014 and $2.45 in 2013.\nNet Interest Income\nThe primary source of earnings for the Company is net interest income, which is the difference between income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing sources of funds, such as deposits and borrowings. The following table shows the average balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, average yields earned and rates paid on those respective balances, and the resulting interest income and interest expense for the periods indicated. Average balances are calculated based on daily balances, yields on non-taxable investments are not reported on a tax equivalent basis and average balances for loans include nonaccrual loans even though interest was not earned.\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAverage Balances, Income and Expenses, Yields and Rates\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td> </td>

rates declined 5 basis points from 0.64% in 2014 to 0.59% in 2015. As a result, the Company's average interest rate spread improved to 3.14% in 2015 as compared to 3.11% in 2014. The year over year decline in asset yields and liability costs were a result of low market interest rates. These factors have contributed to an improvement in the net interest margin from 3.20% in 2014 to 3.24% in 2015.\nAverage interest earning assets increased $50,335 and was funded principally by an increase in average noninterest-bearing demand deposits of $24,601 and an increase in average interest bearing deposits of $13,813. Average interest-earning assets for 2015 were $1,674,872 or 92.85% of average total assets.\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest income is the largest contributor to income and totaled $62,484 in 2015 compared to $60,950 in 2014, an increase of $1,534 or 2.52%. The largest component is interest income on loans, including loan fees, which increased slightly from $45,844 in 2014 to $46,291 in 2015. The increase was due primarily to higher average balances which increased from $942,636 in 2014 to $966,651 in 2015. Partially offsetting these higher balances were declining yields, which dropped from 4.86% in 2014 to 4.79% in 2015. The average yield decreased in part due to the low interest rate environment for new and renewing loans. The Company has attempted to slow the decline in yields by enforcing established floors on loans but as loans mature the yields have fallen due to competitive reasons.\nInterest income on taxable investment securities increased $368 or 3.10% and interest income on tax-exempt investment securities increased $548 or 21.31%. Average taxable investment balances remained relatively flat while average tax-exempt investment balances increased $21,793 or 25.88%. The average yield on the taxable investment portfolio increased from 2.09% in 2014 to 2.16% in 2015 while the average yield on the tax-exempt investment portfolio declined from 3.05% in 2014 to 2.94% in 2015.\nInterest expense totaled $8,227 for 2015 compared to $8,886 in 2014, a decrease of $659 or 7.42% due primarily to interest expense on deposits which decreased $462 from $6,252 in 2014 to $5,790 in 2015. This decrease in deposit interest expense was primarily attributable to a decrease in rates paid. The average rate paid on NOW accounts decreased from 0.28% in 2014 to 0.27% in 2015. The average rate paid on savings and money management accounts decreased from 0.31% in 2014 to 0.29% in 2015 and the average rate paid on time deposits decreased from 0.92% in 2014 to 0.85% in 2015. The mix of interest bearing deposits also affects the interest rate spread. During 2015 average time deposits decreased $22,278 while average NOW accounts increased $19,105 and average savings and money management accounts increased $16,986.\nThe overall result was an increase in net interest income of $2,193 or 4.21% in 2015 over 2014 due mostly to an increase in volume of average interest earning assets.\nA key performance measure for net interest income is the net interest margin\u201d, or net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Unlike the net interest spread\u201d (the difference between interest rates earned on assets and interest rates paid on liabilities), the net interest margin is affected by the level of non-interest sources of funding used to support interest-earning assets. The Company's net interest spread increased 3 bps to 3.14% in 2015. The net interest margin also increased from 3.20% in 2014 to 3.24% in 2015. The high level of competition in the local market for both loans and particularly deposits continues to influence the net interest margin. The net interest margin continues to be partially supported by demand deposits which provide a noninterest-bearing source of funds.\n2014 compared with 2013:\nInterest earning asset yields declined 20 basis points from 3.95% in 2013 to 3.75% in 2014 while interest bearing liability rates declined 6 basis points from 0.70% in 2013 to 0.64% in 2014. As a result the Company's average interest rate spread contracted to 3.11% in 2014 as compared to 3.25% in 2013. The year over year decline in asset yields and liability costs were a result of low market interest rates. These factors have contributed to a decrease in the net interest margin from 3.35% in 2013 to 3.20% in 2014.\nAverage interest earning assets increased $46,378 and was funded principally by an increase in average noninterest-bearing demand deposits of $21,612 and an increase in average interest bearing deposits of $20,108. Average interest-earning assets for 2014 were $1,624,537 or 93.30% of average total assets.\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>38 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest income is the largest contributor to income and totaled $60,950 in 2014 compared to $62,314 in 2013, a decrease of $1,364 or 2.19%. The largest component is interest income on loans, including loan fees, which decreased slightly from $46,479 in 2013 to $46,444 in 2014. The decline was due primarily to lower average yields which declined from 5.21% in 2013 to 4.86% in 2014. The average yield decreased in part due to the low interest rate environment for new and renewing loans. The Company has attempted to slow the decline in yields by enforcing established floors on loans but as loans mature the yields have fallen due to competitive reasons.\nInterest income on taxable investment securities declined $1,050 or 8.13% and interest income on tax-exempt investment securities decreased $275 or 9.66%. Average taxable and tax-exempt investment balances decreased $4,826 and $3,805 or 0.84% and 4.32%, respectively, but the effect on income was less severe than the decline in the average portfolio yield. The average yield on the taxable investment portfolio declined from 2.26% in 2013 to 2.09% in 2014 and the average yield on the tax-exempt investment portfolio declined from 3.23% in 2013 to 3.05% in 2014. Yields on investments purchased during the year were generally lower in 2014 and were impacted by a high level of proceeds from maturities and calls and sales of available for sale securities which totaled $76,649 and $211,188, respectively. Some securities sales occurred based on asset liability strategies.\nInterest expense totaled $8,886 for 2014 compared to $9,514 in 2013, a decrease of $628 or 6.60%. The decline was due primarily to interest expense on deposits which decreased $542 from $6,794 in 2013 to $6,252 in 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in rates paid on deposits. The average rate paid on NOW accounts decreased from 0.31% in 2013 to 0.28% in 2014. The average rate paid on savings and money management accounts decreased from 0.35% in 2013 to 0.31% in 2014 and the average rate paid on time deposits decreased from 0.99% in 2013 to 0.92% in 2014. The mix of interest bearing deposits also affects the interest rate spread. During 2014 average time deposits decreased $360 while average NOW accounts increased $19,197 and average savings and money management accounts increased $1,271.\nThe overall result was a decrease in net interest income of $736 or 1.39% in 2014 over 2013 due to asset yields declining faster than liability costs partially offset by an increase in volume of average interest earning assets.\nThe Company's net interest spread decreased 14 bps to 3.11% in 2014. The net interest margin also decreased from 3.35% in 2013 to 3.20% in 2014. The high level of competition in the local market for both loans and particularly deposits continues to influence the net interest margin. The net interest margin continues to be partially supported by demand deposits which provide a noninterest-bearing source of funds. The Company continues to focus on demand deposits and NOW accounts to help prevent further deterioration in the net interest margin.\nChanges in the net interest income from period to period result from increases or decreases in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, increases or decreases in the average rates earned and paid on such assets and liabilities, the ability to manage the earning asset portfolio, and the availability of particular sources of funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits. The following table: Analysis of Changes in Net Interest Income\u201d indicates the changes in the Company's net interest income as a result of changes in volume and rate from 2014 to 2015, and from 2013 to 2014. The low interest rate environment in 2015 resulted in continued decreases in yields on interest-earning assets, but also in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The analysis indicates that, on an overall basis in 2015, increased volumes of interest-earning assets created a positive impact on income but was partially offset by decreases in average rates earned. When combined with reduced expense due to lower average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities, the result was an increase in net interest income of $2,193. In 2014, decreases in average rates on interest earning assets reduced income more than the positive effect of increased volumes. Lower average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities reduced expense, but not enough to offset the reduction in income resulting in a decrease in net interest income of $736.\nTable 102:

the allowance for loan losses at a level which, in management's estimate, is adequate to cover the estimated amount of probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. A credit for loan losses totaling $1,628 was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to a provision for loan losses of $3,492 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The credit resulted in part from a $1,666 recovery in the second quarter of 2015 related to the repayment of a nonaccrual acquisition, development and construction loan. See Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d for further analysis of the provision for loan losses.\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income consists of revenues generated from a broad range of financial services and activities, including service charges on deposit accounts, gain on sales of loans, fee-based services, and products where commissions are earned through sales of products such as real estate mortgages, retail investment services, trust services, and other activities. In addition, increases in cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance, gain on sale of fixed assets, gains or losses realized from the sale of investment securities and other-than-temporary losses are included in noninterest income.\n2015 compared with 2014:\nNoninterest income totaled $18,688 in 2015 compared to $19,030 in 2014, a decrease of $342 or 1.80%. The decrease was due primarily to investment securities losses of $1,043 in 2015 compared to investment gains of $825 in 2014. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in gain on sales of loans, which increased $1,130 or 20.68% due to increased mortgage originations and refinancing activity. Other factors included an increase in service charges and deposit fees of $135, and increase in trust service fees of $98 and an increase in cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance of $96.\n2014 compared with 2013:\nNoninterest income totaled $19,030 in 2014 compared to $18,497 in 2013, an increase of $533 or 2.88%. The increase was due primarily to increased investment securities gains of $1,720 partially offset by decreased gain on sales of loans, which decreased $1,378 or 20.14% due to lower volume of loans originated for sale in 2014 compared to 2013. Other factors included an increase in trust service fees of $125 and an increase in retail investment income of $89.\nThe following table presents the principal components of noninterest income for the last three years:\nNoninterest Income\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Service charges and fees on deposits </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,315 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,155 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gain on sales of loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,595 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,465 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,843 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gain on sale of fixed assets, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Investment securities (losses) gains, net of OTTI </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,043 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>825 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(895 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Retail investment income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,182 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,188 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,099 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Trust service fees </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,408 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,185 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Earnings from cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,259 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,163 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,187 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Miscellaneous income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>936 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>835 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>897 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total noninterest income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,688 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,030 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,497 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Noninterest income as a percentage of total average assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.04 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.09 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.09 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Noninterest income as a percentage of total income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.02 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.79 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.89 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>41 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest Expense\n2015 compared with 2014:\nNoninterest expense totaled $46,040 in 2015, an increase of $2,552 or 5.87% over 2014. The primary reasons for the increase were salaries and other personnel expense, which increased $1,337, and a $955 prepayment penalty fee on an FHLB Advance during the second quarter of 2015.\nSalaries and other personnel expense increased $1,337 or 5.34%. The increase was attributable in large part to salary increases, increased incentive compensation and commission expense. These increases were partially offset by a $966 reduction in deferred compensation expense caused by an increase in the discount rate used to value the salary continuation liability.\nOther operating expenses increased $412 or 2.90% and included a $428 increase in processing expense due in part to the migration to an outsourced mainframe computer system and a $552 increase in operational losses due primarily to fraudulent charges on customer debit cards partially offset by a $490 decrease in loan costs excluding OREO.\nOccupancy expense increased $178 or 4.45% in 2015 due primarily to increased depreciation expense associated with new equipment purchases.\nOREO gains totaled $102 in 2015 compared to OREO losses of $228 in 2014. This reflects a $257 reduction in write-downs on such properties this year and included a gain of $116 related to sales, as compared to a gain of $43 in 2014.\n2014 compared with 2013:\nNoninterest expense totaled $43,488 in 2014, an increase of $3,122 or 7.73% over 2013. The primary reasons for the increase were salaries and other personnel expense, which increased $1,968 and other operating expense, which increased $1,290.\nSalaries and other personnel expense increased $1,968 or 8.53%. The increase was attributable in large part to increased retirement and other benefit plan costs of $1,856.\nOther operating expenses increased $1,290 or 9.98% and included an $888 increase in processing expense due to the migration to an outsourced mainframe computer system and a $428 increase in legal and professional fees due to regulatory compliance issues.\nOccupancy expense increased $278 or 7.47% in 2014 due primarily to increased depreciation expense associated with new computer and automated teller machines.\nOREO losses totaled $228 compared to $642 in 2013. This included a gain of $43 related to sales in 2014, as compared to a loss of $42 in 2013, and $271 related to further write-downs on such properties due to either updated appraisals or other indications of value.\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>42 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company continues to monitor expenditures in all organizational units by utilizing specific cost-accounting and reporting methods as well as responsibility center budgeting.

The effective tax rate as a percentage of pre-tax income was 32.03% in 2015, 31.03% in 2014, and 30.42% in 2013. The primary reason for the increase in the effective tax rate this year was a smaller percentage of tax-exempt interest income on investment securities and income related to bank-owned life insurance relative to total income.\nFinancial Condition\nComposition of the Loan Portfolio\nLoans are the primary component of the Company's interest-earning assets and generally are expected to provide higher yields than the other categories of earning assets. Those higher yields reflect the inherent credit risks associated with the loan portfolio. Management attempts to control and balance those risks with the rewards associated with higher returns.\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoans outstanding averaged $966,651 in 2015 compared to $942,636 in 2014 and $880,565 in 2013. At December 31, 2015, loans totaled $1,009,149 compared to $966,356 at December 31, 2014, an increase of $42,793 or 4.43%.\nIn 2015 growth in loans occurred in most categories, but primarily in residential real estate loans which increased $25,064 or 12.28% and acquisition, development and construction loans which increased $19,989 or 12.17%. Residential loans increased as the Bank elected to hold some permanent mortgages on its books and the increase in acquisition, development and construction loans occurred in its primary market area mainly in the fourth quarter of 2015. In response to the economic environment over the last several years, management curtailed the origination and participation of new out of market ADC lending opportunities. As a result, the out of market ADC portfolio decreased $11,044 or 20.37% in 2015.\nThe following table sets forth the composition of the Company's loan portfolio as of December 31st for the past five years. The Company's loan portfolio does not contain any concentrations of loans exceeding 10% of total loans which are not otherwise disclosed as a category of loans in this table. The Company has not invested in loans to finance highly-leveraged transactions (\"HLT\"), such as leveraged buy-out transactions, as defined by the Federal Reserve and other regulatory agencies. Loans made by a bank for recapitalization or acquisitions (including acquisitions by management or employees) which result in a material change in the borrower's financial structure to a highly-leveraged condition are considered HLT loans. The Company had no foreign loans or loans to lesser-developed countries as of December 31st of any of the years presented.\nLoan Portfolio Composition\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td>

These loans are classified as nonaccrual, even though the presence of collateral or the borrower's financial strength may be sufficient to provide for ultimate repayment. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual, the interest which has been accrued but remains unpaid is reversed and deducted from current period interest income. No additional interest is accrued and recognized as income on the loan balance until the collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain. Also, there may be write downs, and ultimately, the total charge-off of the principal balance of the loan, which could necessitate additional charges to earnings through the provision for loan losses.\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>45 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross interest income that would have been recorded for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 if non-accruing loans and accruing troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the year or since origination, if held for part of the year, was approximately $864, $973 and $1,224, respectively. The amount of interest income on these loans that was included in net income for December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was approximately $735, $400 and $945, respectively.\nThe Company is required to identify impaired loans and evaluate the collectability of both contractual interest and principal of loans when assessing the need for a loss allowance. Large pools of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment. A loan is considered impaired, when based upon current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the note agreement. The amount of the impairment is measured based on the present value of future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or, if the loan is collateral dependent or foreclosure is probable, the fair value of collateral, less estimated selling expenses. Regulatory guidance is also considered. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had total impaired loans of $15,472 and $20,189, respectively, which includes loans carried at fair value with a recorded investment of $10,171 and $11,730, respectively at December 31, 2015 and 2014. Charge-offs of $3,546 and $1,831 were taken on these impaired loans during 2015 and 2014.\nNon-performing assets include nonaccrual loans, restructured loans and other real estate owned. The following table, Non-Performing Assets\u201d, presents information on these assets as of December 31st, for the past five years. Non-performing assets were $17,766 at December 31, 2015 or 1.76% of period end loans and other real estate owned. This compares to $21,903 or 2.26% of total loans and other real estate owned at December 31, 2014.\nAt December 31, 2015 there were $127 of loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing. There were no loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing at December 31, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011. All loans past due 90 days or more are classified as nonaccrual loans unless lending management believes the loan is well-secured and in process of collection, in which case the loan continues to accrue interest.\nTroubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) are troubled loans in which the original terms have been modified in favor of the borrower or either principal or interest has been forgiven, due to deterioration in the borrower's financial condition. There were $8,636 in TDRs at December 31, 2015, of which $5,274 were on nonaccrual status. TDRs totaled $9,669 at December 31, 2014, of which $3,477 were on nonaccrual status.\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>46 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>

2014, nonaccrual commercial real estate loans increased $5,266 due primarily to one troubled loan and one impaired loan that were moved to nonaccrual status during the last half of the year. Decreases in nonaccrual acquisition, development and construction loans of $3,337 and nonaccrual commercial, financial and agricultural loans of $2,307 more than offset this increase. The decrease in nonaccrual acquisition, development and construction loans was mostly due to the repayment of a $4,544 participation loan made to finance a retail center that was sold in the second quarter of 2015. The decrease in nonaccrual commercial, financial and agricultural loans was due in part to write downs of $500 taken in both the first and second quarters of 2015 on a defaulted loan that was moved to nonaccrual status during the fourth quarter of 2014.\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>47 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below provides additional detail on nonaccrual loans greater than $1,000 at December 31, 2015.\nNonaccrual Loans\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Nonaccrual </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Appraisal </td> <td> </td> <td>Appraised </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Balance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Originated </td> <td> </td> <td>Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Trigger </td> <td> </td> <td>Collateral </td> <td> </td> <td>Allowance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Method </td> <td> </td> <td>Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Value </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial real estate </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,673 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>01/06/11 </td> <td> </td> <td>09/18/15 </td> <td> </td> <td>financial condition </td> <td> </td> <td>motel </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>collateral value </td> <td> </td> <td>09/15 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,050 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,498 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>01/17/12 </td> <td> </td> <td>12/21/15 </td> <td> </td> <td>financial condition </td> <td> </td> <td>land & gym </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>income approach </td> <td> </td> <td>12/11 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>ADC Loan -

These loans, principally classified for regulatory purposes as substandard, are principally commercial real estate loans in the company's primary market area. Estimated probable incurred losses from these potential credit weaknesses have been provided for in determining the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2015.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses represents an allocation for the estimated amount of probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. The Company has developed policies and procedures for evaluating the overall quality of its loan portfolio and the timely identification of problem credits. Management continues to review these policies and procedures and makes further improvements as needed. The adequacy of the Company's allowance for loan losses and the effectiveness of the Company's internal policies and procedures are also reviewed periodically by the Company's regulators and the Company's internal loan review personnel. The Company's regulators may advise the Company to recognize additions to the allowance based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. Such regulatory guidance is considered, and the Company may recognize additions to the allowance as a result.\nThe Company's Board of Directors, with the recommendation of management, approves the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses based upon internal policies and procedures, historical loan loss ratios, loan volume, size and character of the loan portfolio, concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries, value of the collateral underlying the loans, specific problem loans and present or anticipated economic conditions and trends. The Company continues to refine the methodology on which the level of the allowance for loan losses is based, by comparing historical loss ratios utilized to actual experience and by classifying loans for analysis based on similar risk characteristics.\nFor significant problem loans, management's review consists of the evaluation of the financial condition and strengths of the borrower, cash flows available for debt repayment, related collateral supporting the loan and the effects of known and expected economic conditions. When the evaluation reflects a greater than normal risk associated with the individual problem loan, management classifies the loan accordingly and allocates a portion of the allowance for loan losses for that loan based on the results of the evaluations described above.\nAdditions to the allowance for loan losses, which are expensed on the Company's income statement as the provision for loan losses\u201d, are made periodically to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level based upon management's analysis of risk in the loan portfolio. The Company had a credit for loan losses of $1,628 in 2015 compared to a provision of $3,492 in 2014. The credit in 2015 resulted primarily from a $1,666 recovery in the second quarter of 2015 related to the repayment of a previously written-down impaired loan.\nThe Company's approach to ALLL reserve calculation uses two distinct perspectives, the guidelines of using Financial Accounting Standards ASC 450 (Accounting for Contingencies) and ASC 310 (Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan, for individual loans). The process is generally as follows, with the same methodology applied to all classes of loans within the portfolio segments:\nTable 122: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Loans are grouped in categories of similar risk characteristics (portfolio segments). </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>49 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>For each loan category, a four year average rolling historical net loss rate is calculated, with the loss rate more heavily weighted to the most recent two years loss history. The historical loss ratios are adjusted for internal and external qualitative factors within each loan category. Factors include: </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>o </td> <td>levels and trends in delinquencies and impaired/classified/graded loans; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>o </td> <td>changes in the quality of the loan review system; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>o </td> <td>trends in volume and terms of loans; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>o </td> <td>effects of changes in risk selection and underwriting standards, and other changes in lending policies, procedures and practices; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>o </td> <td>experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>o </td> <td>national and local economic trends and conditions; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>o </td> <td>changes in the value of underlying collateral; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>o </td> <td>other external factors-competition, legal and regulatory requirements; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>o </td> <td>effects of changes in credit concentrations. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>The resultant loss factor is applied to each respective loan pool to calculate the ALLL for each loan pool. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>The total of each loan pool is then added to the ALLL determined for individual loans evaluated for impairment in accordance with ASC 310. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDue to the added risks associated with loans, which are graded as special mention or substandard, that are not classified as impaired, the qualitative factor adjustment is further increased for such classifications within each category.\nThe table below indicates the allocated allowance for all loans according to loan type determined through the Company's comprehensive allowance methodology for the years indicated. Because these allocations are based upon estimates and subjective judgment, it is not necessarily indicative of the specific amounts or loan categories in which loan losses may occur.\nAllocation of

The decline in 2015 was due to a decline in the average historical net loss rate, the level of recoveries and improving economic conditions. Although net charge-offs have decreased significantly from prior years, the Company continued to experience elevated levels of net charge-offs in the commercial real estate and commercial, financial and agricultural categories in 2015. Collateral dependent impaired loans are evaluated based on recent appraisals of the collateral. Collateral values are monitored and further charge-offs are taken if it is determined that collateral values have continued to decline.\nNet charge-offs totaled $2,511 at December 31, 2015, of which $2,234 were related to commercial real estate loans and $955 were related to commercial, financial and agricultural loans. Also included were net recoveries of $1,413 for acquisition, development and construction loans. The provisions for loan losses allocated to individual portfolio segments are affected by the calculation of average historical net loss rate factors and by the internal and external qualitative factors within each category.\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement considers the current allowance appropriate based upon its analysis of risk in the portfolio using the methods previously discussed. Management's judgment is based upon a number of assumptions about events which are believed to be reasonable, but which may or may not prove correct. While it is the Company's policy to charge off in the current period the loans in which a loss is considered probable, there are additional risks of losses which cannot be quantified precisely or attributed to a particular loan or class of loans. Because management evaluates such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, historical loss rates, overall portfolio quality, review of specific problem loans, and current economic conditions and trends that may affect a borrower's ability to repay, management's judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance is necessarily approximate and imprecise. Thus, there can be no assurance that charge-offs in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses or that additional increases in the allowance will not be required. See Critical Accounting Estimates.\u201d\nInvestment Securities\nThe Company's investment securities portfolio increased $47,098 to $691,563 at year-end 2015 from 2014. The Company maintains an investment strategy of seeking portfolio yields within acceptable risk levels, as well as providing liquidity. The Company maintains \"Available for Sale\" investment securities. \"Available for Sale\" securities are carried at fair market value with related unrealized gains or losses included in stockholders' equity as accumulated other comprehensive income. As a consequence, the Company's stockholders' equity is more volatile than it would be if a large percentage of investment securities were \"Held to Maturity.\" Although equity is more volatile, management has discretion, with respect to the \"Available for Sale\" securities, to proactively adjust to favorable market conditions in order to provide liquidity and realize gains on the sales of securities. The changes in values in the investment securities portfolio are not taken into account in determining regulatory capital requirements. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, except for the U.S. Government agencies and government sponsored entities, there was no issuer who represented 10% or more of stockholders' equity within the investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the estimated fair value of investment securities as a percentage of their amortized cost was 100.00% and 100.32%, respectively. At December 31, 2015, the investment securities portfolio had gross unrealized gains of $5,939 and gross unrealized losses of $5,909, for a net unrealized gain of $30. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the investment securities portfolio had a net unrealized gain of $2,075 and a net unrealized loss of $15,765, respectively.

Lines of credit are unfunded commitments to extend credit. These instruments involve, in varying degrees, exposure to credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the financial statements. The Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for unfunded commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company follows the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.\nUnfunded commitments to extend credit where contractual amounts represent potential credit risk totaled $226,331 and $171,911 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This includes standby letters of credit of $4,494 at December 31, 2015 and $5,730 at December 31, 2014. These commitments are primarily at variable interest rates.\nThe Company's commitments are funded through internal funding sources of scheduled repayments of loans and sales and maturities of investment securities available-for-sale or external funding sources through acceptance of deposits from customers or borrowings from other financial institutions.\nThe following table is a summary of the Company's commitments to extend credit, commitments under contractual leases as well as the Company' contractual obligations, consisting of deposits, FHLB advances, which are subject to early termination options, borrowed funds and benefit plans by contractual maturity date.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 - 3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 - 5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 Years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Lines of credit (1) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>221,837 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Standby letters of credit (1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,494 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Lease agreements </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>263 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>244 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Deposits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,400,048 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>110,791 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,241 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Securities sold under repurchase agreements </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,684 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Salary continuation agreements </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>551 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,457 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,636 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,550 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>FHLB advances </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Subordinated debentures </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total commitments and contractual obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,642,877 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>186,492 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,895 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,550 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>Presented at contractual amounts; however, since many of these are expected to expire unused or partially used, the total amounts do not necessarily reflect future cash requirements </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAlthough management regularly monitors the balance of outstanding commitments to fund loans to ensure funding availability should the need arise, management believes that the risk of all customers fully drawing on all these lines of credit at the same time is remote.\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>55 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAsset/Liability Management, Interest Rate Sensitivity and Liquidity\nGeneral. It is the objective of the Company to manage assets and liabilities to preserve the integrity and safety of the deposit and capital base of the Company by protecting the Company from undue exposure to poor asset quality and interest rate risk. Additionally, the Company pursues a consistent level of earnings as further protection for the depositors and to provide an appropriate return to stockholders on their investment.\nThese objectives are achieved through compliance with an established framework of asset/liability, interest rate risk, loan, investment, and capital policies. Management is responsible for monitoring policies and procedures that result in proper management of the components of the asset/liability function to achieve stated objectives. The Company's philosophy is to support quality asset growth primarily through growth of core deposits, which include non-volatile deposits of individuals, partnerships and corporations. Management seeks to invest the largest portion of the Company's assets in loans that meet the Company's quality standards. Alternative investments are made in the investment portfolio. The Company's asset/liability function and related components of liquidity and interest rate risk are monitored on a continuous basis by management. The Board of Directors reviews and monitors these functions on a monthly basis.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe purpose of the Company's interest rate risk management process is to quantify and control interest rate risk while, at the same time, focusing on the net interest margin and net income for profit. Changes in interest rates can affect the earnings of the bank and can also affect the economic value of the underlying financial instruments. For this reason, the institution's interest rate risk measurement process measures earnings at risk as well as economic value at risk. The Company's interest rate risk policy works in conjunction with other policies (namely: loan, funds management, capital and investment) in order to achieve the Bank's overall goals. An objective of the policy is to maintain a balanced risk profile so that variations to net interest income and economic value of equity stay within policy limits.\nOn a quarterly basis, a twenty-four month simulation of net interest income is performed, as well as the economic value of equity, based upon level plus and minus 100, 200, 300, and 400 basis point shocks. The primary method is a static simulation model based on current exposures to interest rates and assumes a constant balance sheet with no new growth. The results of the shocks are presented to a Board Committee on a quarterly basis and compared to the related policy limits. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,\u201d for the net interest income simulation results for December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>56 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity\nManagement of the Company's liquidity position is closely related to the process of asset/liability management. Liquidity represents the ability to provide steady sources of funds for loan commitments and investment activities, as well as to provide sufficient funds to cover deposit withdrawals and payment of debt and operating obligations. The Company intends to meet its liquidity needs by managing cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and purchased, maturity of investment securities, principal repayments received from mortgage-backed securities and lines of credit as necessary. GB&T maintains a line of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank approximating 10% of its total assets. Federal Home Loan Bank advances are collateralized by eligible first mortgages, commercial real estate loans and investment securities. GB&T maintains repurchase lines of credit with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Atlanta, Georgia, for advances up to $30,000 of which $15,000 was outstanding at December 31, 2015 and a $10,000 repurchase line of credit with CenterState Bank, Orlando, Florida, of which none was outstanding at December 31, 2015. GB&T has a federal funds purchased accommodation with SunTrust Bank, Atlanta, Georgia, for advances up to $10,000, of which none was outstanding at December 31, 2015 and a federal funds purchased accommodation with CenterState Bank, Orlando, Florida, for advances up to $10,000, of which none was outstanding at December 31, 2015. The Company also maintains a borrowing facility at the Federal Reserve Bank, under the Borrower-In-Custody Program, of which none was outstanding at December 31, 2015. Additionally, liquidity needs can be supplemented by the structuring of the maturities of investment securities and the pricing and maturities on loans and deposits offered to customers. The Company also uses retail securities sold under repurchase agreements to fund operations. Retail securities sold under repurchase agreements were $684 at December 31, 2015.\nCapital\nTotal stockholders' equity was $169,913 at December 31, 2015, an increase of $14,627 or 9.42% from the previous year. The change in stockholders equity resulted from an increase in retained earnings of $15,348 partially offset by a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which decreased $1,282 from 2014 due primarily to a decrease in market values of investment securities available for sale. The Company purchased 400 and 1,282 shares of treasury stock in 2015 and 2014 at a cost of $11 and $32, respectively, which is shown as a reduction of stockholders' equity. The Company issued 1,131 and 794 shares of treasury stock in 2015 and 2014 at a price of $29 and $17, respectively, for the Director Stock Purchase Plan.\nThe Company's average equity to average total assets was 9.06% in 2015 compared to 8.31% in 2014 and 7.99% in 2013. Capital is considered to be adequate to meet present operating needs and anticipated future operating requirements.\nThe following table presents the return on equity and assets for the years 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nReturn on Equity and Assets\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Return on average total assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.08 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.96 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.97 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Return on average equity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.87 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.49 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.09 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2015, the Bank was well above the minimum capital ratios required under the regulatory risk-based capital guidelines and was considered well capitalized.

The rules include a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, which is in addition to the Tier 1, common equity Tier 1 and total risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer is being phased in over four years beginning on January 1, 2016, with a maximum buffer of 0.625% of risk-weighted assets for 2016, 1.25% for 2017, 1.875% for 2018, and 2.5% for 2019 and thereafter. Failure to maintain the required capital conservation buffer will result in limitations on capital distributions and on discretionary bonuses to executive officers. Based on the Company's current capital composition and levels, management does not presently anticipate that the rules present a material risk to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.\nExcept as set forth above, management is not aware of any other events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company's liquidity, capital resources or operations.\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>58 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $26,975 in 2015, an increase of $8,279 from 2014. Net cash provided by operating activities was $18,696 in 2014, a decrease of $30,631 from 2013.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $106,367 in 2015 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $43,945 in 2014. The change was primarily due to growth in the investment portfolio in 2015 as compared to 2014. Net cash used in investing activities was $43,945 in 2014 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $76,729 in 2013. Changes included a lower investment securities portfolio in 2014 compared to 2013 and an increase in loans. Loans increased $61,963 in 2014 compared to an increase in loans of $44,929 in 2013.\nNet cash provided by financing activities in 2015 was $86,314 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $13,908 in 2014. The primary reason for the change was a $65,216 increase in deposits and a $21,000 net increase in FHLB advances. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2014 was $13,908 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $30,850 in 2013. Contributing to this change was an increase in deposits of $9,061 and an increase in federal funds purchased and securities sold of $9,870.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe Company may, from time to time, make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission\u201d) and its reports to shareholders. Statements made in such documents, other than those concerning historical information, should be considered forward-looking and subject to various risks and uncertainties. Such forward-looking statements are made based upon management's belief as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management pursuant to safe harbor\u201d provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including unanticipated changes in the Company's local economies, the national economy, governmental monetary and fiscal policies, deposit levels, loan demand, loan collateral values and securities portfolio values; difficulties in interest rate risk management; the effects of competition in the banking business; difficulties in expanding the Company's business into new markets; changes in governmental regulation relating to the banking industry, including but not limited to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the Basel III international capital accord; failure of assumptions underlying the establishment of reserves for loan losses, including the value of collateral underlying delinquent loans; and other factors. The Company cautions that such factors are not exclusive. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that may be made from time to time by, or on behalf of, the Company.\nAdoption of New Accounting Standards\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued an update (ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers) creating FASB Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The guidance in this update affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (for example, insurance contracts or lease contracts). The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance provides steps to follow to achieve the core principle. An entity should disclose sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Qualitative and quantitative information is required about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. The amendments in this update are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements.\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>59 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEffects of Inflation and Changing Prices\nInflation generally increases the cost of funds and operating overhead, and to the extent loans and other assets bear variable rates, the yields on such assets. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on the performance of a financial institution than the effects of general levels of inflation. Although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction and to the same extent as the prices of goods and services, increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates. In addition, inflation can increase a financial institution's cost of goods and services purchased, the cost of salaries and benefits, occupancy expense and similar items. Inflation and related increases in interest rates generally decrease the market value of investments and loans held and may adversely affect liquidity, earnings, and stockholders' equity. Mortgage originations and refinances tend to slow as interest rates increase, and can reduce the Company's earnings from such activities and the income from the sale of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market.\nVarious information shown elsewhere herein will assist in the understanding of how well the Company is positioned to react to changing interest rates and inflationary trends. In particular, the summary of net interest income, the maturity distributions and compositions of the loan and security portfolios and the data on the interest sensitivity of loans and deposits should be considered.\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>60 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>", "item_7_truncated": " 40 \nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Within </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>One to Five </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>After Five </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>One Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial, financial and agricultural </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,637 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>102,331 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>57,744 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>210,712 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Real Estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,472 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>183,011 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>141,083 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>366,566 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Residential </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,438 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,802 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>149,921 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>229,161 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Acquisition, development and construction </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>108,236 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61,205 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,851 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>184,292 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consumer </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,885 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,420 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,279 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,584 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Deferred loan origination costs (fees) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(166 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(166 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total loans </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>238,502 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>403,769 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>366,878 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,009,149 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest expense totaled $43,488 in 2014, an increase of $3,122 or 7.73% over 2013.

Securities sold under repurchase agreements are also offered. Additional services include wealth management, trust, retail investment, and mortgage. As a matter of practice, most mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market; however, some mortgage loans are placed in the portfolio based on asset/liability management strategies. The Company continues to concentrate on increasing its market share through various new deposit and loan products and other financial services and by focusing on its customer relationship management philosophy. The Company is committed to building lifelong relationships with its customers, employees, shareholders, and the communities it serves.\n 52 \nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td>

The discussion and analysis is intended to supplement and highlight information contained in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nOn July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC approved rules that implement the Basel III\u201d regulatory capital reforms, as well as certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The rules include a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, which is in addition to the Tier 1, common equity Tier 1 and total risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer is being phased in over four years beginning on January 1, 2016, with a maximum buffer of 0.625% of risk-weighted assets for 2016, 1.25% for 2017, 1.875% for 2018, and 2.5% for 2019 and thereafter. Failure to maintain the required capital conservation buffer will result in limitations on capital distributions and on discretionary bonuses to executive officers. Based on the Company's current capital composition and levels, management does not presently anticipate that the rules present a material risk to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.\nA significant portion of the Company's assets are financial instruments carried at fair value. This includes securities available-for-sale, loans held for sale, certain impaired loans, mortgage banking derivatives and other real estate owned. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 the percentage of total assets measured at fair value was 39.16% and 38.95%, respectively. The majority of assets carried at fair value are based on either quoted market prices or market prices for similar instruments. At December 31, 2015, 1.46% of assets measured at fair value were based on significant unobservable inputs. This consisted primarily of impaired loans and other real estate owned. This represents approximately 0.57% of the Company's total assets. See Note 6 Fair Value Measurements\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d herein for additional disclosures regarding the fair value of financial instruments.\nThe purpose of the Company's interest rate risk management process is to quantify and control interest rate risk while, at the same time, focusing on the net interest margin and net income for profit. Changes in interest rates can affect the earnings of the bank and can also affect the economic value of the underlying financial instruments. For this reason, the institution's interest rate risk measurement process measures earnings at risk as well as economic value at risk. The Company's interest rate risk policy works in conjunction with other policies (namely: loan, funds management, capital and investment) in order to achieve the Bank's overall goals. An objective of the policy is to maintain a balanced risk profile so that variations to net interest income and economic value of equity stay within policy limits.\nThe primary source of earnings for the Company is net interest income, which is the difference between income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing sources of funds, such as deposits and borrowings. The following table shows the average balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, average yields earned and rates paid on those respective balances, and the resulting interest income and interest expense for the periods indicated. Average balances are calculated based on daily balances, yields on non-taxable investments are not reported on a tax equivalent basis and average balances for loans include nonaccrual loans even though interest was not earned.\nThe provision for loan losses is the charge to operating earnings necessary to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level which, in management's estimate, is adequate to cover the estimated amount of probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. A credit for loan losses totaling $1,628 was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to a provision for loan losses of $3,492 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The credit resulted in part from a $1,666 recovery in the second quarter of 2015 related to the repayment of a nonaccrual acquisition, development and construction loan. See Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d for further analysis of the provision for loan losses.\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Beginning balance, January 1 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Additions </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>611 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,256 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Increase in valuation allowance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(271 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,460 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(935 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gain on sale of OREO, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>116 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Ending balance, December 31 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>360 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,107 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOREO gains totaled $102 in 2015 compared to OREO losses of $228 in 2014.

Unlike the net interest spread\u201d (the difference between interest rates earned on assets and interest rates paid on liabilities), the net interest margin is affected by the level of non-interest sources of funding used to support interest-earning assets. The Company's net interest spread increased 3 bps to 3.14% in 2015. The net interest margin also increased from 3.20% in 2014 to 3.24% in 2015. The high level of competition in the local market for both loans and particularly deposits continues to influence the net interest margin. The net interest margin continues to be partially supported by demand deposits which provide a noninterest-bearing source of funds.\nThe Company's net interest spread decreased 14 bps to 3.11% in 2014. The net interest margin also decreased from 3.35% in 2013 to 3.20% in 2014. The high level of competition in the local market for both loans and particularly deposits continues to influence the net interest margin. The net interest margin continues to be partially supported by demand deposits which provide a noninterest-bearing source of funds. The Company continues to focus on demand deposits and NOW accounts to help prevent further deterioration in the net interest margin.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe earnings performance of the Company is reflected in its return on average assets and average equity of 1.08% and 11.87%, respectively, during 2015 compared to 0.96% and 11.49%, respectively, during 2014.

expense totaled $8,886 for 2014 compared to $9,514 in 2013, a decrease of $628 or 6.60%. The decline was due primarily to interest expense on deposits which decreased $542 from $6,794 in 2013 to $6,252 in 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in rates paid on deposits. The average rate paid on NOW accounts decreased from 0.31% in 2013 to 0.28% in 2014. The average rate paid on savings and money management accounts decreased from 0.35% in 2013 to 0.31% in 2014 and the average rate paid on time deposits decreased from 0.99% in 2013 to 0.92% in 2014. The mix of interest bearing deposits also affects the interest rate spread. During 2014 average time deposits decreased $360 while average NOW accounts increased $19,197 and average savings and money management accounts increased $1,271.\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td> </td>

creating FASB Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The guidance in this update affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (for example, insurance contracts or lease contracts). The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance provides steps to follow to achieve the core principle. An entity should disclose sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Qualitative and quantitative information is required about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. The amendments in this update are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements.\nWhile total nonaccrual loans remained relatively flat in 2015 as compared to 2014, nonaccrual commercial real estate loans increased $5,266 due primarily to one troubled loan and one impaired loan that were moved to nonaccrual status during the last half of the year. Decreases in nonaccrual acquisition, development and construction loans of $3,337 and nonaccrual commercial, financial and agricultural loans of $2,307 more than offset this increase. The decrease in nonaccrual acquisition, development and construction loans was mostly due to the repayment of a $4,544 participation loan made to finance a retail center that was sold in the second quarter of 2015. The decrease in nonaccrual commercial, financial and agricultural loans was due in part to write downs of $500 taken in both the first and second quarters of 2015 on a defaulted loan that was moved to nonaccrual status during the fourth quarter of 2014.\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 vs. 2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 vs. 2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>

investment securities portfolio increased $47,098 to $691,563 at year-end 2015 from 2014. The Company maintains an investment strategy of seeking portfolio yields within acceptable risk levels, as well as providing liquidity. The Company maintains \"Available for Sale\" investment securities. \"Available for Sale\" securities are carried at fair market value with related unrealized gains or losses included in stockholders' equity as accumulated other comprehensive income. As a consequence, the Company's stockholders' equity is more volatile than it would be if a large percentage of investment securities were \"Held to Maturity.\" Although equity is more volatile, management has discretion, with respect to the \"Available for Sale\" securities, to proactively adjust to favorable market conditions in order to provide liquidity and realize gains on the sales of securities. The changes in values in the investment securities portfolio are not taken into account in determining regulatory capital requirements. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, except for the U.S. Government agencies and government sponsored entities, there was no issuer who represented 10% or more of stockholders' equity within the investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the estimated fair value of investment securities as a percentage of their amortized cost was 100.00% and 100.32%, respectively. At December 31, 2015, the investment securities portfolio had gross unrealized gains of $5,939 and gross unrealized losses of $5,909, for a net unrealized gain of $30. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the investment securities portfolio had a net unrealized gain of $2,075 and a net unrealized loss of $15,765, respectively. The following table presents the amortized cost of investment securities held by the Company at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nIncome tax expense totaled $9,138 in 2015 compared to $7,482 in 2014. The effective tax rate as a percentage of pre-tax income was 32.03% in 2015, 31.03% in 2014, and 30.42% in 2013. The primary reason for the increase in the effective tax rate this year was a smaller percentage of tax-exempt interest income on investment securities and income related to bank-owned life insurance relative to total income.\nThe Company continues to monitor expenditures in all organizational units by utilizing specific cost-accounting and reporting methods as well as responsibility center budgeting. The following table presents the principal components of noninterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nAt December 31, 2015\nAt December 31, 2015, the allowance for loan losses declined to 2.12% of outstanding loans, from 2.64% at December 31, 2014 and 2.92% at December 31, 2013. The decline in 2015 was due to a decline in the average historical net loss rate, the level of recoveries and improving economic conditions. Although net charge-offs have decreased significantly from prior years, the Company continued to experience elevated levels of net charge-offs in the commercial real estate and commercial, financial and agricultural categories in 2015. Collateral dependent impaired loans are evaluated based on recent appraisals of the collateral. Collateral values are monitored and further charge-offs are taken if it is determined that collateral values have continued to decline.\nOver the past four years, assets grew $225,592 from $1,614,773 at December 31, 2011 to $1,840,365 at December 31, 2015. From year end 2011 to year end 2015, deposits increased $109,858, and loans increased $163,139. Net interest income for the year ended 2011 was $50,562 compared to net interest income of $54,257 in 2015. On April 24, 2013, the Company reinstated quarterly cash dividends of $0.13 per share. On January 14, 2015, the Company increased the cash dividend to $0.15 per share and on January 20, 2016 increased quarterly cash dividends to $0.16 per share.\nThe following table presents the average amount outstanding and the average rate paid on deposits and borrowings by the Company for the years 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nThe Company is party to lines of credit with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. Lines of credit are unfunded commitments to extend credit. These instruments involve, in varying degrees, exposure to credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the financial statements. The Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for unfunded commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company follows the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.\n 59 \nThe overall result was an increase in net interest income of $2,193 or 4.21% in 2015 over 2014 due mostly to an increase in volume of average interest earning assets.\nLoans are the primary component of the Company's interest-earning assets and generally are expected to provide higher yields than the other categories of earning assets. Those higher yields reflect the inherent credit risks associated with the loan portfolio. Management attempts to control and balance those risks with the rewards associated with higher returns.\nAt December 31, 2015\nThe following table represents maturities and weighted average yields of debt securities at December 31, 2015. Yields are based on the amortized cost of securities. Maturities are based on the contractual maturities. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.\n\nThe net decrease in other real estate owned is attributable to both reduced additions and increased sales in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nNon-Performing Assets\nLoan Maturity Schedule\n 53 \nThe accounting and financial reporting policies of the Company and its subsidiary conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and to general practices within the banking industry. Of these policies, management has identified the allowance for loan losses, determining the fair values of financial instruments including other real estate owned, interest rate swap derivatives, investment securities, and other-than-temporary impairment as critical accounting estimates that requires difficult, subjective judgment and are important to the presentation of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.\n o national and local economic trends and conditions; \n 47 \nAverage interest earning assets increased $46,378 and was funded principally by an increase in average noninterest-bearing demand deposits of $21,612 and an increase in average interest bearing deposits of $20,108. Average interest-earning assets for 2014 were $1,624,537 or 93.30% of average total assets.\n\nOverview\nNoninterest Expense\n 36 \nThe Company's commitments are funded through internal funding sources of scheduled repayments of loans and sales and maturities of investment securities available-for-sale or external funding sources through acceptance of deposits from customers or borrowings from other financial institutions.\n 33 \n2015 compared with 2014:\nOther operating expenses increased $1,290 or 9.98% and included an $888 increase in processing expense due to the migration to an outsourced mainframe computer system and a $428 increase in legal and professional fees due to regulatory compliance issues.\nThe allowance for loan losses represents an allocation for the estimated amount of probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. The Company has developed policies and procedures for evaluating the overall quality of its loan portfolio and the timely identification of problem credits. Management continues to review these policies and procedures and makes further improvements as needed. The adequacy of the Company's allowance for loan losses and the effectiveness of the Company's internal policies and procedures are also reviewed periodically by the Company's regulators and the Company's internal loan review personnel. The Company's regulators may advise the Company to recognize additions to the allowance based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. Such regulatory guidance is considered, and the Company may recognize additions to the allowance as a result.\n\nCash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities\nProvision for Loan Losses\n\nThe Company's approach to ALLL reserve calculation uses two distinct perspectives, the guidelines of using Financial Accounting Standards ASC 450 (Accounting for Contingencies) and ASC 310 (Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan, for individual loans). The process is generally as follows, with the same methodology applied to all classes of loans within the portfolio segments:\nInflation generally increases the cost of funds and operating overhead, and to the extent loans and other assets bear variable rates, the yields on such assets. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on the performance of a financial institution than the effects of general levels of inflation. Although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction and to the same extent as the prices of goods and services, increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates. In addition, inflation can increase a financial institution's cost of goods and services purchased, the cost of salaries and benefits, occupancy expense and similar items. Inflation and related increases in interest rates generally decrease the market value of investments and loans held and may adversely affect liquidity, earnings, and stockholders' equity. Mortgage originations and refinances tend to slow as interest rates increase, and can reduce the Company's earnings from such activities and the income from the sale of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market.\nTotal stockholders' equity was $169,913 at December 31, 2015, an increase of $14,627 or 9.42% from the previous year. The change in stockholders equity resulted from an increase in retained earnings of $15,348 partially offset by a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which decreased $1,282 from 2014 due primarily to a decrease in market values of investment securities available for sale. The Company purchased 400 and 1,282 shares of treasury stock in 2015 and 2014 at a cost of $11 and $32, respectively, which is shown as a reduction of stockholders' equity. The Company issued 1,131 and 794 shares of treasury stock in 2015 and 2014 at a price of $29 and $17, respectively, for the Director Stock Purchase Plan.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nFinancial Condition\nThe provision for loan losses is the charge to operating earnings necessary to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses. The Company has developed policies and procedures for evaluating the overall quality of its loan portfolio and the timely identification of problem credits. Management continues to review these policies and procedures and makes further improvements as needed. The adequacy of the Company's allowance for loan losses and the effectiveness of the Company's internal policies and procedures are also reviewed periodically by the Company's regulators and the Company's internal loan review personnel. The Company's regulators may advise the Company to recognize additions to the allowance based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. Such regulatory guidance is considered, and the Company may recognize additions to the allowance as a result.\nDeposits\nAssets acquired through or instead of loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. These assets are subsequently accounted for at lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. If fair value declines subsequent to foreclosure, a valuation allowance is recorded through expense. Operating costs after acquisition are expensed. Costs related to the development and improvement of real estate owned are capitalized.\nInterest earning asset yields declined 2 basis points from 3.75% in 2014 to 3.73% in 2015 while interest bearing liability rates declined 5 basis points from 0.64% in 2014 to 0.59% in 2015. As a result, the Company's average interest rate spread improved to 3.14% in 2015 as compared to 3.11% in 2014. The year over year decline in asset yields and liability costs were a result of low market interest rates. These factors have contributed to an improvement in the net interest margin from 3.20% in 2014 to 3.24% in 2015.\nOccupancy expense increased $278 or 7.47% in 2014 due primarily to increased depreciation expense associated with new computer and automated teller machines.\nInterest income on taxable investment securities increased $368 or 3.10% and interest income on tax-exempt investment securities increased $548 or 21.31%. Average taxable investment balances remained relatively flat while average tax-exempt investment balances increased $21,793 or 25.88%. The average yield on the taxable investment portfolio increased from 2.09% in 2014 to 2.16% in 2015 while the average yield on the tax-exempt investment portfolio declined from 3.05% in 2014 to 2.94% in 2015.\nForward-Looking Statements\nAsset/Liability Management, Interest Rate Sensitivity and Liquidity\nReturn on Equity and Assets\n 58 \n\n 54 \nOccupancy expense increased $178 or 4.45% in 2015 due primarily to increased depreciation expense associated with new equipment purchases.\nThe Company recorded net income of $19,395 in 2015 compared to $16,632 in 2014. The increase in net income is primarily attributable to a credit for loan losses of $1,628 compared to a provision for loan losses of $3,492 in 2014. In addition, net interest income increased $2,193 and gain on sales of loans increased $1,130. Partially offsetting these were a $2,552 increase in noninterest expense and investment securities losses of $1,043 compared to a gain of $825 in the prior year.\n 43 \nThis table indicates that the majority of time deposits of $100 or more have a maturity of less than twelve months. This is reflective of both the Company's market and recent interest rate environments. At December 31, 2015, the Company had $71,099 of brokered certificates of deposit that mature after 12 months.\nNonaccrual Loans\n 39 \nNet charge-offs totaled $2,511 at December 31, 2015, of which $2,234 were related to commercial real estate loans and $955 were related to commercial, financial and agricultural loans. Also included were net recoveries of $1,413 for acquisition, development and construction loans. The provisions for loan losses allocated to individual portfolio segments are affected by the calculation of average historical net loss rate factors and by the internal and external qualitative factors within each category.\nThe Company continues to refine the methodology on which the level of the allowance for loan losses is based, by comparing historical loss ratios utilized to actual experience and by classifying loans for analysis based on similar risk characteristics. Cash receipts for accruing loans are applied to principal and interest under the contractual terms of the loan agreement; however, cash receipts on impaired and nonaccrual loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are applied to principal and interest income depending upon the overall risk of principal loss to the Company.\nNet Interest Income\nAt December 31, 2015, the Bank was well above the minimum capital ratios required under the regulatory risk-based capital guidelines and was considered well capitalized. The following table presents the capital ratios for the Company and the Bank.\n 51 \nCritical Accounting Estimates\nGross interest income that would have been recorded for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 if non-accruing loans and accruing troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the year or since origination, if held for part of the year, was approximately $864, $973 and $1,224, respectively. The amount of interest income on these loans that was included in net income for December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was approximately $735, $400 and $945, respectively.\nNoninterest expense increased $2,552 or 5.87% in 2015 mostly due to a $1,337 increase in salaries and other personnel expense and a $955 prepayment penalty fee on an FHLB Advance. The operating efficiency ratio increased from 61.78% in 2014 to 62.29% in 2015.\nInterest expense totaled $8,227 for 2015 compared to $8,886 in 2014, a decrease of $659 or 7.42% due primarily to interest expense on deposits which decreased $462 from $6,252 in 2014 to $5,790 in 2015. This decrease in deposit interest expense was primarily attributable to a decrease in rates paid. The average rate paid on NOW accounts decreased from 0.28% in 2014 to 0.27% in 2015. The average rate paid on savings and money management accounts decreased from 0.31% in 2014 to 0.29% in 2015 and the average rate paid on time deposits decreased from 0.92% in 2014 to 0.85% in 2015. The mix of interest bearing deposits also affects the interest rate spread. During 2015 average time deposits decreased $22,278 while average NOW accounts increased $19,105 and average savings and money management accounts increased $16,986.\n \u00b7 Loans are grouped in categories of similar risk characteristics (portfolio segments). \nInterest income is the largest contributor to income and totaled $60,950 in 2014 compared to $62,314 in 2013, a decrease of $1,364 or 2.19%. The largest component is interest income on loans, including loan fees, which decreased slightly from $46,479 in 2013 to $46,444 in 2014. The decline was due primarily to lower average yields which declined from 5.21% in 2013 to 4.86% in 2014. The average yield decreased in part due to the low interest rate environment for new and renewing loans. The Company has attempted to slow the decline in yields by enforcing established floors on loans but as loans mature the yields have fallen due to competitive reasons.\nOn a quarterly basis, a twenty-four month simulation of net interest income is performed, as well as the economic value of equity, based upon level plus and minus 100, 200, 300, and 400 basis point shocks. The primary method is a static simulation model based on current exposures to interest rates and assumes a constant balance sheet with no new growth. The results of the shocks are presented to a Board Committee on a quarterly basis and compared to the related policy limits. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,\u201d for the net interest income simulation results for December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nInterest earning asset yields declined 20 basis points from 3.95% in 2013 to 3.75% in 2014 while interest bearing liability rates declined 6 basis points from 0.70% in 2013 to 0.64% in 2014. As a result the Company's average interest rate spread contracted to 3.11% in 2014 as compared to 3.25% in 2013. The year over year decline in asset yields and liability costs were a result of low market interest rates. These factors have contributed to a decrease in the net interest margin from 3.35% in 2013 to 3.20% in 2014.\nThe fair values for available-for-sale securities are generally based upon quoted market prices or observable market prices for similar instruments. These values take into account recent market activity as well as other market observable data such as interest rate, spread and prepayment information. When market observable data is not available, which generally occurs due to the lack of liquidity for certain securities, the valuation of the security is subjective and may involve substantial judgment. The Company conducts periodic reviews to identify and evaluate each available-for-sale security that has an unrealized loss for other-than-temporary impairment. An unrealized loss exists when the fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis. The primary factors the Company considers in determining whether an impairment is other-than-temporary are the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer and whether the Company intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had no securities valued using unobservable inputs (Level 3).\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $26,975 in 2015, an increase of $8,279 from 2014. Net cash provided by operating activities was $18,696 in 2014, a decrease of $30,631 from 2013.\nThe Company meets its liquidity needs by managing cash and due from banks, federal funds purchased and sold, maturity of investment securities, principal repayments received from mortgage-backed securities, and draws on lines of credit. Additionally, liquidity can be managed through structuring deposit and loan maturities. The Company funds loan and investment growth with core deposits, securities sold under repurchase agreements, Federal Home Loan Bank advances and other wholesale funding including brokered certificates of deposit. During inflationary periods, interest rates generally increase and operating expenses generally rise. When interest rates rise, variable rate loans and investments produce higher earnings; however, deposit and other borrowings interest expense also rise. The Company monitors its interest rate risk as it applies to net interest income in various simulations up and down 400 basis points (4.00%) and as it applies to economic value of equity in a shock up and down 400 basis points (4.00%) scenario. The Company monitors operating expenses through responsibility center budgeting. See -Interest Rate Sensitivity\u201d below.\nInvestment Securities\nOther Real Estate Owned\nThe fair value of interest rate swap derivatives is determined based on discounted cash flow valuation models using observable market data as of the measurement date. The fair value adjustment is included in other liabilities. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d herein for additional disclosures regarding the fair value of financial instruments.\nThe following table presents the return on equity and assets for the years 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nNoninterest income decreased $342 in 2015 and was due primarily to investment securities losses of $1,043, partially offset by increased gain on sales of loans of $1,130. Also offsetting the investment losses were increased service charges and deposit fees of $135, trust service fees, which increased $98, and cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance, which increased $96.\nInterest income on taxable investment securities declined $1,050 or 8.13% and interest income on tax-exempt investment securities decreased $275 or 9.66%. Average taxable and tax-exempt investment balances decreased $4,826 and $3,805 or 0.84% and 4.32%, respectively, but the effect on income was less severe than the decline in the average portfolio yield. The average yield on the taxable investment portfolio declined from 2.26% in 2013 to 2.09% in 2014 and the average yield on the tax-exempt investment portfolio declined from 3.23% in 2013 to 3.05% in 2014. Yields on investments purchased during the year were generally lower in 2014 and were impacted by a high level of proceeds from maturities and calls and sales of available for sale securities which totaled $76,649 and $211,188, respectively. Some securities sales occurred based on asset liability strategies.\nIn 2015 growth in loans occurred in most categories, but primarily in residential real estate loans which increased $25,064 or 12.28% and acquisition, development and construction loans which increased $19,989 or 12.17%. Residential loans increased as the Bank elected to hold some permanent mortgages on its books and the increase in acquisition, development and construction loans occurred in its primary market area mainly in the fourth quarter of 2015. In response to the economic environment over the last several years, management curtailed the origination and participation of new out of market ADC lending opportunities. As a result, the out of market ADC portfolio decreased $11,044 or 20.37% in 2015.\nInterest Rate Swap Derivatives\nOther Real Estate Owned\n 42 \nThe variances for each major category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are attributable to (a) changes in volume (changes in volume times prior year rate), (b) changes in rate (changes in rate times prior year volume) and (c) combined (changes in rate times the change in volume).\nThe overall result was a decrease in net interest income of $736 or 1.39% in 2014 over 2013 due to asset yields declining faster than liability costs partially offset by an increase in volume of average interest earning assets.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations\nOther operating expenses increased $412 or 2.90% and included a $428 increase in processing expense due in part to the migration to an outsourced mainframe computer system and a $552 increase in operational losses due primarily to fraudulent charges on customer debit cards partially offset by a $490 decrease in loan costs excluding OREO.\nInvestment Securities\n 48 \n\n\nInterest income is the largest contributor to income and totaled $62,484 in 2015 compared to $60,950 in 2014, an increase of $1,534 or 2.52%. The largest component is interest income on loans, including loan fees, which increased slightly from $45,844 in 2014 to $46,291 in 2015. The increase was due primarily to higher average balances which increased from $942,636 in 2014 to $966,651 in 2015. Partially offsetting these higher balances were declining yields, which dropped from 4.86% in 2014 to 4.79% in 2015. The average yield decreased in part due to the low interest rate environment for new and renewing loans. The Company has attempted to slow the decline in yields by enforcing established floors on loans but as loans mature the yields have fallen due to competitive reasons.\nNoninterest expense totaled $46,040 in 2015, an increase of $2,552 or 5.87% over 2014. The primary reasons for the increase were salaries and other personnel expense, which increased $1,337, and a $955 prepayment penalty fee on an FHLB Advance during the second quarter of 2015.\nSalaries and other personnel expense increased $1,337 or 5.34%. The increase was attributable in large part to salary increases, increased incentive compensation and commission expense. These increases were partially offset by a $966 reduction in deferred compensation expense caused by an increase in the discount rate used to value the salary continuation liability.\nThe following table presents the maturities of the Company's time deposits over $100 at December 31, 2015:\n 60 \nNet cash provided by financing activities in 2015 was $86,314 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $13,908 in 2014. The primary reason for the change was a $65,216 increase in deposits and a $21,000 net increase in FHLB advances. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2014 was $13,908 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $30,850 in 2013. Contributing to this change was an increase in deposits of $9,061 and an increase in federal funds purchased and securities sold of $9,870.\nThe table below presents a roll forward of other real estate owned for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n 49 \nThe Company's primary source of income is from its lending activities followed by interest income from its investment activities, service charges and fees on deposits, and gain on sales of mortgage loans in the secondary market. Despite declining yields, interest income on loans increased slightly due to increased volumes in the loan portfolio. Interest income on investment securities increased $916 or 6.34% due to increased volume and yields. In addition, gain on sales of mortgage loans increased $1,130 or 20.68% due to increased mortgage originations and refinancing activity in 2015.\nAt December 31, 2015 there were $127 of loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing. There were no loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing at December 31, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011. All loans past due 90 days or more are classified as nonaccrual loans unless lending management believes the loan is well-secured and in process of collection, in which case the loan continues to accrue interest.\nANALYSIS OF CAPITAL\n \u00b7 The total of each loan pool is then added to the ALLL determined for individual loans evaluated for impairment in accordance with ASC 310. \nThe following table provides details regarding charge-offs and recoveries by loan category during the most recent five year period, as well as supplemental information relating to both net loan losses, the provision and the allowance for loan losses during each of the past five years. Net charge-offs for 2015 represented 0.26% of average loans outstanding, compared to 0.47% for 2014 and 1.12% for 2013.\n 44 \n\n 55 \n o experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; \n\n 41 \nUnfunded commitments to extend credit where contractual amounts represent potential credit risk totaled $226,331 and $171,911 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This includes standby letters of credit of $4,494 at December 31, 2015 and $5,730 at December 31, 2014. These commitments are primarily at variable interest rates.\n2014 compared with 2013:\nNon-performing assets include nonaccrual loans, restructured loans and other real estate owned. The following table, Non-Performing Assets\u201d, presents information on these assets as of December 31st, for the past five years. Non-performing assets were $17,766 at December 31, 2015 or 1.76% of period end loans and other real estate owned. This compares to $21,903 or 2.26% of total loans and other real estate owned at December 31, 2014.\n o changes in the value of underlying collateral; \nIn addition to loans disclosed above as past due, nonaccrual and restructured as of December 31, 2015, management identified weaknesses in $6,641 of classified loans. These loans, principally classified for regulatory purposes as substandard, are principally commercial real estate loans in the company's primary market area. Estimated probable incurred losses from these potential credit weaknesses have been provided for in determining the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2015.\nDue to the added risks associated with loans, which are graded as special mention or substandard, that are not classified as impaired, the qualitative factor adjustment is further increased for such classifications within each category.\nAllocation of the Allowance for Loan Loss\nManagement of the Company's liquidity position is closely related to the process of asset/liability management. Liquidity represents the ability to provide steady sources of funds for loan commitments and investment activities, as well as to provide sufficient funds to cover deposit withdrawals and payment of debt and operating obligations. The Company intends to meet its liquidity needs by managing cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and purchased, maturity of investment securities, principal repayments received from mortgage-backed securities and lines of credit as necessary. GB&T maintains a line of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank approximating 10% of its total assets. Federal Home Loan Bank advances are collateralized by eligible first mortgages, commercial real estate loans and investment securities. GB&T maintains repurchase lines of credit with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Atlanta, Georgia, for advances up to $30,000 of which $15,000 was outstanding at December 31, 2015 and a $10,000 repurchase line of credit with CenterState Bank, Orlando, Florida, of which none was outstanding at December 31, 2015. GB&T has a federal funds purchased accommodation with SunTrust Bank, Atlanta, Georgia, for advances up to $10,000, of which none was outstanding at December 31, 2015 and a federal funds purchased accommodation with CenterState Bank, Orlando, Florida, for advances up to $10,000, of which none was outstanding at December 31, 2015. The Company also maintains a borrowing facility at the Federal Reserve Bank, under the Borrower-In-Custody Program, of which none was outstanding at December 31, 2015. Additionally, liquidity needs can be supplemented by the structuring of the maturities of investment securities and the pricing and maturities on loans and deposits offered to customers. The Company also uses retail securities sold under repurchase agreements to fund operations. Retail securities sold under repurchase agreements were $684 at December 31, 2015.\n\n 57 \nNoninterest Expense\nManagement considers the current allowance appropriate based upon its analysis of risk in the portfolio using the methods previously discussed. Management's judgment is based upon a number of assumptions about events which are believed to be reasonable, but which may or may not prove correct. While it is the Company's policy to charge off in the current period the loans in which a loss is considered probable, there are additional risks of losses which cannot be quantified precisely or attributed to a particular loan or class of loans. Because management evaluates such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, historical loss rates, overall portfolio quality, review of specific problem loans, and current economic conditions and trends that may affect a borrower's ability to repay, management's judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance is necessarily approximate and imprecise. Thus, there can be no assurance that charge-offs in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses or that additional increases in the allowance will not be required. See Critical Accounting Estimates.\u201d\nThe allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, which affects the Company's earnings directly. Loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance. The allowance is an amount that reflects management's estimate of the level of probable incurred losses in the portfolio. Factors considered by management in determining the adequacy of the allowance include, but are not limited to: (1) detailed reviews of individual loans; (2) historical and current trends in loan charge-offs for the various portfolio segments evaluated; (3) the level of the allowance in relation to total loans and to historical loss levels; (4) levels and trends in non-performing and past due loans; (5) collateral values of properties securing loans; and (6) management's assessment of economic conditions. The Company's Board of Directors reviews the recommendations of management regarding the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses based upon these factors.\nLoans outstanding averaged $966,651 in 2015 compared to $942,636 in 2014 and $880,565 in 2013. At December 31, 2015, loans totaled $1,009,149 compared to $966,356 at December 31, 2014, an increase of $42,793 or 4.43%.\n 50 \nChanges in the net interest income from period to period result from increases or decreases in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, increases or decreases in the average rates earned and paid on such assets and liabilities, the ability to manage the earning asset portfolio, and the availability of particular sources of funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits. The following table: Analysis of Changes in Net Interest Income\u201d indicates the changes in the Company's net interest income as a result of changes in volume and rate from 2014 to 2015, and from 2013 to 2014. The low interest rate environment in 2015 resulted in continued decreases in yields on interest-earning assets, but also in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The analysis indicates that, on an overall basis in 2015, increased volumes of interest-earning assets created a positive impact on income but was partially offset by decreases in average rates earned. When combined with reduced expense due to lower average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities, the result was an increase in net interest income of $2,193. In 2014, decreases in average rates on interest earning assets reduced income more than the positive effect of increased volumes. Lower average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities reduced expense, but not enough to offset the reduction in income resulting in a decrease in net interest income of $736.\n 45 \nThe following table sets forth the composition of the Company's loan portfolio as of December 31st for the past five years. The Company's loan portfolio does not contain any concentrations of loans exceeding 10% of total loans which are not otherwise disclosed as a category of loans in this table. The Company has not invested in loans to finance highly-leveraged transactions (\"HLT\"), such as leveraged buy-out transactions, as defined by the Federal Reserve and other regulatory agencies. Loans made by a bank for recapitalization or acquisitions (including acquisitions by management or employees) which result in a material change in the borrower's financial structure to a highly-leveraged condition are considered HLT loans. The Company had no foreign loans or loans to lesser-developed countries as of December 31st of any of the years presented.\nThe Company's Board of Directors, with the recommendation of management, approves the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses based upon internal policies and procedures, historical loan loss ratios, loan volume, size and character of the loan portfolio, concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries, value of the collateral underlying the loans, specific problem loans and present or anticipated economic conditions and trends. The Company continues to refine the methodology on which the level of the allowance for loan losses is based, by comparing historical loss ratios utilized to actual experience and by classifying loans for analysis based on similar risk characteristics.\n2015 compared with 2014:\nNoninterest Income\n\nNoninterest income consists of revenues generated from a broad range of financial services and activities, including service charges on deposit accounts, gain on sales of loans, fee-based services, and products where commissions are earned through sales of products such as real estate mortgages, retail investment services, trust services, and other activities. In addition, increases in cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance, gain on sale of fixed assets, gains or losses realized from the sale of investment securities and other-than-temporary losses are included in noninterest income.\n\nInterest expense decreased $659 or 7.42% to $8,227 in 2015. Interest expense on deposits decreased $462 or 7.39% to $5,790 and was due primarily to declines in rates paid on deposits and a $22,278 decline in average time deposits. Due to the low interest rate environment many customers have transferred out of time deposits to more liquid NOW and savings accounts. Brokered CDs decreased $28,914 or 15.37% and totaled $159,180 at year end 2015.\n2015 compared with 2014:\n(1) Restructured loans on nonaccrual status at year end are included under nonaccrual loans in the table.\nEffects of Inflation and Changing Prices\n\nLoans may be periodically renewed with principal reductions and appropriate interest rate adjustments. Loan maturities as of December 31, 2015 are set forth in the following table based upon contractual terms. Actual cash flows may differ as borrowers generally have the right to prepay without prepayment penalties.\nPlease see Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d and Non-Performing Assets\u201d for a further discussion of the Company's loans, loss experience, and methodology in determining the allowance.\nLoan Portfolio Composition\nThe table below indicates the allocated allowance for all loans according to loan type determined through the Company's comprehensive allowance methodology for the years indicated. Because these allocations are based upon estimates and subjective judgment, it is not necessarily indicative of the specific amounts or loan categories in which loan losses may occur.\nThese objectives are achieved through compliance with an established framework of asset/liability, interest rate risk, loan, investment, and capital policies. Management is responsible for monitoring policies and procedures that result in proper management of the components of the asset/liability function to achieve stated objectives. The Company's philosophy is to support quality asset growth primarily through growth of core deposits, which include non-volatile deposits of individuals, partnerships and corporations. Management seeks to invest the largest portion of the Company's assets in loans that meet the Company's quality standards. Alternative investments are made in the investment portfolio. The Company's asset/liability function and related components of liquidity and interest rate risk are monitored on a continuous basis by management. The Board of Directors reviews and monitors these functions on a monthly basis.\n o levels and trends in delinquencies and impaired/classified/graded loans; \nNoninterest income totaled $18,688 in 2015 compared to $19,030 in 2014, a decrease of $342 or 1.80%. The decrease was due primarily to investment securities losses of $1,043 in 2015 compared to investment gains of $825 in 2014. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in gain on sales of loans, which increased $1,130 or 20.68% due to increased mortgage originations and refinancing activity. Other factors included an increase in service charges and deposit fees of $135, and increase in trust service fees of $98 and an increase in cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance of $96.\n\n 35 \nGeneral. It is the objective of the Company to manage assets and liabilities to preserve the integrity and safety of the deposit and capital base of the Company by protecting the Company from undue exposure to poor asset quality and interest rate risk. Additionally, the Company pursues a consistent level of earnings as further protection for the depositors and to provide an appropriate return to stockholders on their investment.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\n\n(1) Tax-equivalent yield\n\nIncome Taxes\nCapital\nThe Company continues to focus on the net interest margin, regulatory capital requirements, liquidity management, risk mitigation and expense control. Problem asset resolution, new consumer disclosure regulations, upgrades to operating systems, balance sheet management and investment purchases have been key areas of focus in 2015.\nNoninterest Income\n\n 56 \n o trends in volume and terms of loans; \nNet cash used in investing activities was $106,367 in 2015 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $43,945 in 2014. The change was primarily due to growth in the investment portfolio in 2015 as compared to 2014. Net cash used in investing activities was $43,945 in 2014 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $76,729 in 2013. Changes included a lower investment securities portfolio in 2014 compared to 2013 and an increase in loans. Loans increased $61,963 in 2014 compared to an increase in loans of $44,929 in 2013.\n o changes in the quality of the loan review system; \nNet income in 2015 was $19,395 compared to $16,632 in 2014. Earnings were positively impacted by a $1,628 credit for loan losses, primarily due to the repayment of a previously written down impaired loan during the second quarter of 2015 that resulted in a $1,666 recovery. In addition, net interest income increased $2,193 and gain on sales of loans increased $1,130. These increases were partially offset by a $2,552 increase in noninterest expense and investment securities losses of $1,043 compared to gains of $825 in the prior year.\nThe table below provides additional detail on nonaccrual loans greater than $1,000 at December 31, 2015.\nThe following table presents the principal components of noninterest income for the last three years:\nVarious information shown elsewhere herein will assist in the understanding of how well the Company is positioned to react to changing interest rates and inflationary trends. In particular, the summary of net interest income, the maturity distributions and compositions of the loan and security portfolios and the data on the interest sensitivity of loans and deposits should be considered.\nLiquidity\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities increased $17,912 or 1.31% from 2013 to 2014, while average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $21,612 or 12.41% during the same period.\nSensitivity of Loans to Changes in Interest Rates\n 34 \n2014 compared with 2013:\nThe Company may, from time to time, make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission\u201d) and its reports to shareholders. Statements made in such documents, other than those concerning historical information, should be considered forward-looking and subject to various risks and uncertainties. Such forward-looking statements are made based upon management's belief as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management pursuant to safe harbor\u201d provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including unanticipated changes in the Company's local economies, the national economy, governmental monetary and fiscal policies, deposit levels, loan demand, loan collateral values and securities portfolio values; difficulties in interest rate risk management; the effects of competition in the banking business; difficulties in expanding the Company's business into new markets; changes in governmental regulation relating to the banking industry, including but not limited to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the Basel III international capital accord; failure of assumptions underlying the establishment of reserves for loan losses, including the value of collateral underlying delinquent loans; and other factors. The Company cautions that such factors are not exclusive. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that may be made from time to time by, or on behalf of, the Company.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe following table is a summary of the Company's commitments to extend credit, commitments under contractual leases as well as the Company' contractual obligations, consisting of deposits, FHLB advances, which are subject to early termination options, borrowed funds and benefit plans by contractual maturity date.\n \u00b7 The resultant loss factor is applied to each respective loan pool to calculate the ALLL for each loan pool. \n\n2014 compared with 2013:\nThe Company's average interest bearing liabilities increased $15,660 or 1.13% from 2014 to 2015. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $24,601 or 12.57%. Average borrowings increased $1,847 or 2.15% from 2014 to 2015. The majority of the growth in deposits reflects the Company's strategy of consistently emphasizing deposit growth, as deposits are the primary source of funding for balance sheet growth. Borrowed funds consist of short-term borrowings, securities sold under agreements to repurchase with the Company's commercial customers and reverse repurchase agreements with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey and CenterState Bank, federal funds purchased, subordinated debentures and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank.\nInvestment Securities\nMaturity Distribution and Yields of Investment Securities\nNoninterest income totaled $19,030 in 2014 compared to $18,497 in 2013, an increase of $533 or 2.88%. The increase was due primarily to increased investment securities gains of $1,720 partially offset by decreased gain on sales of loans, which decreased $1,378 or 20.14% due to lower volume of loans originated for sale in 2014 compared to 2013. Other factors included an increase in trust service fees of $125 and an increase in retail investment income of $89.\nInterest income increased $1,534 or 2.52% to $62,484 in 2015. Interest income on tax-exempt investment securities increased $548 or 21.31% primarily due to an increase in average balance of $21,793 or 25.88%. Interest income on taxable investment securities increased $368 or 3.10% in 2015 caused primarily by an increase in yield. The average rate on taxable investments increased from 2.09% in 2014 to 2.16% in 2015, an increase of 7 basis points. Interest income on loans increased $447 from 2014 due to an increase in average balance partially offset by a decline in yield. Average loans increased from $942,636 in 2014 to $966,651 in 2015, an increase of $24,015 or 2.55%. The average rate on loans dropped from 4.86% in 2014 to 4.79% in 2015, a decrease of 7 basis points.\nAlthough management regularly monitors the balance of outstanding commitments to fund loans to ensure funding availability should the need arise, management believes that the risk of all customers fully drawing on all these lines of credit at the same time is remote.\nAdoption of New Accounting Standards\nResults of Operations\n\n(1) Percent of gross loans in each category to total loans adjusted for loans recorded at fair value\nAdditions to the allowance for loan losses, which are expensed on the Company's income statement as the provision for loan losses\u201d, are made periodically to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level based upon management's analysis of risk in the loan portfolio. The Company had a credit for loan losses of $1,628 in 2015 compared to a provision of $3,492 in 2014. The credit in 2015 resulted primarily from a $1,666 recovery in the second quarter of 2015 related to the repayment of a previously written-down impaired loan.\nThe Company is required to identify impaired loans and evaluate the collectability of both contractual interest and principal of loans when assessing the need for a loss allowance. Large pools of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment. A loan is considered impaired, when based upon current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the note agreement. The amount of the impairment is measured based on the present value of future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or, if the loan is collateral dependent or foreclosure is probable, the fair value of collateral, less estimated selling expenses. Regulatory guidance is also considered. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had total impaired loans of $15,472 and $20,189, respectively, which includes loans carried at fair value with a recorded investment of $10,171 and $11,730, respectively at December 31, 2015 and 2014. Charge-offs of $3,546 and $1,831 were taken on these impaired loans during 2015 and 2014.\n 46 \nAs a result of management's ongoing review of the loan portfolio, loans are classified as nonaccrual when it is not reasonable to expect collections of interest and principal under the original terms, generally when a loan becomes 90 days or more past due. These loans are classified as nonaccrual, even though the presence of collateral or the borrower's financial strength may be sufficient to provide for ultimate repayment. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual, the interest which has been accrued but remains unpaid is reversed and deducted from current period interest income. No additional interest is accrued and recognized as income on the loan balance until the collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain. Also, there may be write downs, and ultimately, the total charge-off of the principal balance of the loan, which could necessitate additional charges to earnings through the provision for loan losses.", "item_7_text": " 40 \nNoninterest expense totaled $43,488 in 2014, an increase of $3,122 or 7.73% over 2013. The primary reasons for the increase were salaries and other personnel expense, which increased $1,968 and other operating expense, which increased $1,290.\nThe Company's services include the origination of residential and commercial real estate loans, construction and development loans, and commercial and consumer loans. The Company also offers a variety of deposit programs, including noninterest-bearing demand, interest checking, money management, savings, and time deposits. In the Augusta-Richmond County, GA-SC metropolitan statistical area, the Company had 19.45% of all deposits and was the second largest depository institution and the largest locally based institution at June 30, 2015 based on deposit levels, as cited from the FDIC's website. Securities sold under repurchase agreements are also offered. Additional services include wealth management, trust, retail investment, and mortgage. As a matter of practice, most mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market; however, some mortgage loans are placed in the portfolio based on asset/liability management strategies. The Company continues to concentrate on increasing its market share through various new deposit and loan products and other financial services and by focusing on its customer relationship management philosophy. The Company is committed to building lifelong relationships with its customers, employees, shareholders, and the communities it serves.\n 52 \nThe Company's average equity to average total assets was 9.06% in 2015 compared to 8.31% in 2014 and 7.99% in 2013. Capital is considered to be adequate to meet present operating needs and anticipated future operating requirements.\n(Dollar amounts, except per share amounts, are expressed in thousands unless otherwise noted)\nThe purpose of this discussion is to focus on significant changes in the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its subsidiary, Georgia Bank & Trust Company of Augusta ( GB&T\u201d), during the past three years. The discussion and analysis is intended to supplement and highlight information contained in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nOn July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC approved rules that implement the Basel III\u201d regulatory capital reforms, as well as certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The rules include a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, which is in addition to the Tier 1, common equity Tier 1 and total risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer is being phased in over four years beginning on January 1, 2016, with a maximum buffer of 0.625% of risk-weighted assets for 2016, 1.25% for 2017, 1.875% for 2018, and 2.5% for 2019 and thereafter. Failure to maintain the required capital conservation buffer will result in limitations on capital distributions and on discretionary bonuses to executive officers. Based on the Company's current capital composition and levels, management does not presently anticipate that the rules present a material risk to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.\nA significant portion of the Company's assets are financial instruments carried at fair value. This includes securities available-for-sale, loans held for sale, certain impaired loans, mortgage banking derivatives and other real estate owned. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 the percentage of total assets measured at fair value was 39.16% and 38.95%, respectively. The majority of assets carried at fair value are based on either quoted market prices or market prices for similar instruments. At December 31, 2015, 1.46% of assets measured at fair value were based on significant unobservable inputs. This consisted primarily of impaired loans and other real estate owned. This represents approximately 0.57% of the Company's total assets. See Note 6 Fair Value Measurements\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d herein for additional disclosures regarding the fair value of financial instruments.\nThe purpose of the Company's interest rate risk management process is to quantify and control interest rate risk while, at the same time, focusing on the net interest margin and net income for profit. Changes in interest rates can affect the earnings of the bank and can also affect the economic value of the underlying financial instruments. For this reason, the institution's interest rate risk measurement process measures earnings at risk as well as economic value at risk. The Company's interest rate risk policy works in conjunction with other policies (namely: loan, funds management, capital and investment) in order to achieve the Bank's overall goals. An objective of the policy is to maintain a balanced risk profile so that variations to net interest income and economic value of equity stay within policy limits.\nThe primary source of earnings for the Company is net interest income, which is the difference between income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing sources of funds, such as deposits and borrowings. The following table shows the average balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, average yields earned and rates paid on those respective balances, and the resulting interest income and interest expense for the periods indicated. Average balances are calculated based on daily balances, yields on non-taxable investments are not reported on a tax equivalent basis and average balances for loans include nonaccrual loans even though interest was not earned.\nThe provision for loan losses is the charge to operating earnings necessary to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level which, in management's estimate, is adequate to cover the estimated amount of probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. A credit for loan losses totaling $1,628 was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to a provision for loan losses of $3,492 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The credit resulted in part from a $1,666 recovery in the second quarter of 2015 related to the repayment of a nonaccrual acquisition, development and construction loan. See Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d for further analysis of the provision for loan losses.\nOREO gains totaled $102 in 2015 compared to OREO losses of $228 in 2014. This reflects a $257 reduction in write-downs on such properties this year and included a gain of $116 related to sales, as compared to a gain of $43 in 2014.\n o effects of changes in risk selection and underwriting standards, and other changes in lending policies, procedures and practices; \nOREO losses totaled $228 compared to $642 in 2013. This included a gain of $43 related to sales in 2014, as compared to a loss of $42 in 2013, and $271 related to further write-downs on such properties due to either updated appraisals or other indications of value.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nMaturities of Time Deposits\nExcept as set forth above, management is not aware of any other events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company's liquidity, capital resources or operations.\nThe following table presents an interest rate sensitivity analysis of the Company's loan portfolio as of December 31, 2015. The loans outstanding are shown in the time period where they are first subject to repricing.\n o effects of changes in credit concentrations. \n 37 \nSalaries and other personnel expense increased $1,968 or 8.53%. The increase was attributable in large part to increased retirement and other benefit plan costs of $1,856.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results \tof Operations\n o other external factors-competition, legal and regulatory requirements; and \nAverage interest earning assets increased $50,335 and was funded principally by an increase in average noninterest-bearing demand deposits of $24,601 and an increase in average interest bearing deposits of $13,813. Average interest-earning assets for 2015 were $1,674,872 or 92.85% of average total assets.\n (1) Presented at contractual amounts; however, since many of these are expected to expire unused or partially used, the total amounts do not necessarily reflect future cash requirements \nA key performance measure for net interest income is the net interest margin\u201d, or net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Unlike the net interest spread\u201d (the difference between interest rates earned on assets and interest rates paid on liabilities), the net interest margin is affected by the level of non-interest sources of funding used to support interest-earning assets. The Company's net interest spread increased 3 bps to 3.14% in 2015. The net interest margin also increased from 3.20% in 2014 to 3.24% in 2015. The high level of competition in the local market for both loans and particularly deposits continues to influence the net interest margin. The net interest margin continues to be partially supported by demand deposits which provide a noninterest-bearing source of funds.\nThe Company's net interest spread decreased 14 bps to 3.11% in 2014. The net interest margin also decreased from 3.35% in 2013 to 3.20% in 2014. The high level of competition in the local market for both loans and particularly deposits continues to influence the net interest margin. The net interest margin continues to be partially supported by demand deposits which provide a noninterest-bearing source of funds. The Company continues to focus on demand deposits and NOW accounts to help prevent further deterioration in the net interest margin.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe earnings performance of the Company is reflected in its return on average assets and average equity of 1.08% and 11.87%, respectively, during 2015 compared to 0.96% and 11.49%, respectively, during 2014. Basic and diluted net income per share on weighted average common shares outstanding increased to $2.89 in 2015 compared to $2.49 in 2014 and $2.45 in 2013.\nInterest expense totaled $8,886 for 2014 compared to $9,514 in 2013, a decrease of $628 or 6.60%. The decline was due primarily to interest expense on deposits which decreased $542 from $6,794 in 2013 to $6,252 in 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in rates paid on deposits. The average rate paid on NOW accounts decreased from 0.31% in 2013 to 0.28% in 2014. The average rate paid on savings and money management accounts decreased from 0.35% in 2013 to 0.31% in 2014 and the average rate paid on time deposits decreased from 0.99% in 2013 to 0.92% in 2014. The mix of interest bearing deposits also affects the interest rate spread. During 2014 average time deposits decreased $360 while average NOW accounts increased $19,197 and average savings and money management accounts increased $1,271.\nAverage Balances, Income and Expenses, Yields and Rates\nPotential Problem Loans\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued an update (ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers) creating FASB Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The guidance in this update affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (for example, insurance contracts or lease contracts). The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance provides steps to follow to achieve the core principle. An entity should disclose sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Qualitative and quantitative information is required about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. The amendments in this update are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements.\nWhile total nonaccrual loans remained relatively flat in 2015 as compared to 2014, nonaccrual commercial real estate loans increased $5,266 due primarily to one troubled loan and one impaired loan that were moved to nonaccrual status during the last half of the year. Decreases in nonaccrual acquisition, development and construction loans of $3,337 and nonaccrual commercial, financial and agricultural loans of $2,307 more than offset this increase. The decrease in nonaccrual acquisition, development and construction loans was mostly due to the repayment of a $4,544 participation loan made to finance a retail center that was sold in the second quarter of 2015. The decrease in nonaccrual commercial, financial and agricultural loans was due in part to write downs of $500 taken in both the first and second quarters of 2015 on a defaulted loan that was moved to nonaccrual status during the fourth quarter of 2014.\n\nThe following table provides details of other real estate owned as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nTroubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) are troubled loans in which the original terms have been modified in favor of the borrower or either principal or interest has been forgiven, due to deterioration in the borrower's financial condition. There were $8,636 in TDRs at December 31, 2015, of which $5,274 were on nonaccrual status. TDRs totaled $9,669 at December 31, 2014, of which $3,477 were on nonaccrual status.\nComposition of the Loan Portfolio\nThe Company's efficiency ratio (noninterest expense as a percentage of net interest income and noninterest income, excluding gains and losses on the sale of investments) increased to 62.29% in 2015 as compared to 61.78% in 2014, and 55.52% in 2013.\n \u00b7 For each loan category, a four year average rolling historical net loss rate is calculated, with the loss rate more heavily weighted to the most recent two years loss history. The historical loss ratios are adjusted for internal and external qualitative factors within each loan category. Factors include: \nFor significant problem loans, management's review consists of the evaluation of the financial condition and strengths of the borrower, cash flows available for debt repayment, related collateral supporting the loan and the effects of known and expected economic conditions. When the evaluation reflects a greater than normal risk associated with the individual problem loan, management classifies the loan accordingly and allocates a portion of the allowance for loan losses for that loan based on the results of the evaluations described above.\nAnalysis of Changes in Net Interest Income\n 38 \nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe Company's investment securities portfolio increased $47,098 to $691,563 at year-end 2015 from 2014. The Company maintains an investment strategy of seeking portfolio yields within acceptable risk levels, as well as providing liquidity. The Company maintains \"Available for Sale\" investment securities. \"Available for Sale\" securities are carried at fair market value with related unrealized gains or losses included in stockholders' equity as accumulated other comprehensive income. As a consequence, the Company's stockholders' equity is more volatile than it would be if a large percentage of investment securities were \"Held to Maturity.\" Although equity is more volatile, management has discretion, with respect to the \"Available for Sale\" securities, to proactively adjust to favorable market conditions in order to provide liquidity and realize gains on the sales of securities. The changes in values in the investment securities portfolio are not taken into account in determining regulatory capital requirements. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, except for the U.S. Government agencies and government sponsored entities, there was no issuer who represented 10% or more of stockholders' equity within the investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the estimated fair value of investment securities as a percentage of their amortized cost was 100.00% and 100.32%, respectively. At December 31, 2015, the investment securities portfolio had gross unrealized gains of $5,939 and gross unrealized losses of $5,909, for a net unrealized gain of $30. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the investment securities portfolio had a net unrealized gain of $2,075 and a net unrealized loss of $15,765, respectively. The following table presents the amortized cost of investment securities held by the Company at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nIncome tax expense totaled $9,138 in 2015 compared to $7,482 in 2014. The effective tax rate as a percentage of pre-tax income was 32.03% in 2015, 31.03% in 2014, and 30.42% in 2013. The primary reason for the increase in the effective tax rate this year was a smaller percentage of tax-exempt interest income on investment securities and income related to bank-owned life insurance relative to total income.\nThe Company continues to monitor expenditures in all organizational units by utilizing specific cost-accounting and reporting methods as well as responsibility center budgeting. The following table presents the principal components of noninterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nAt December 31, 2015\nAt December 31, 2015, the allowance for loan losses declined to 2.12% of outstanding loans, from 2.64% at December 31, 2014 and 2.92% at December 31, 2013. The decline in 2015 was due to a decline in the average historical net loss rate, the level of recoveries and improving economic conditions. Although net charge-offs have decreased significantly from prior years, the Company continued to experience elevated levels of net charge-offs in the commercial real estate and commercial, financial and agricultural categories in 2015. Collateral dependent impaired loans are evaluated based on recent appraisals of the collateral. Collateral values are monitored and further charge-offs are taken if it is determined that collateral values have continued to decline.\nOver the past four years, assets grew $225,592 from $1,614,773 at December 31, 2011 to $1,840,365 at December 31, 2015. From year end 2011 to year end 2015, deposits increased $109,858, and loans increased $163,139. Net interest income for the year ended 2011 was $50,562 compared to net interest income of $54,257 in 2015. On April 24, 2013, the Company reinstated quarterly cash dividends of $0.13 per share. On January 14, 2015, the Company increased the cash dividend to $0.15 per share and on January 20, 2016 increased quarterly cash dividends to $0.16 per share.\nThe following table presents the average amount outstanding and the average rate paid on deposits and borrowings by the Company for the years 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nThe Company is party to lines of credit with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. Lines of credit are unfunded commitments to extend credit. These instruments involve, in varying degrees, exposure to credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the financial statements. The Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for unfunded commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company follows the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.\n 59 \nThe overall result was an increase in net interest income of $2,193 or 4.21% in 2015 over 2014 due mostly to an increase in volume of average interest earning assets.\nLoans are the primary component of the Company's interest-earning assets and generally are expected to provide higher yields than the other categories of earning assets. Those higher yields reflect the inherent credit risks associated with the loan portfolio. Management attempts to control and balance those risks with the rewards associated with higher returns.\nAt December 31, 2015\nThe following table represents maturities and weighted average yields of debt securities at December 31, 2015. Yields are based on the amortized cost of securities. Maturities are based on the contractual maturities. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.\n\nThe net decrease in other real estate owned is attributable to both reduced additions and increased sales in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nNon-Performing Assets\nLoan Maturity Schedule\n 53 \nThe accounting and financial reporting policies of the Company and its subsidiary conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and to general practices within the banking industry. Of these policies, management has identified the allowance for loan losses, determining the fair values of financial instruments including other real estate owned, interest rate swap derivatives, investment securities, and other-than-temporary impairment as critical accounting estimates that requires difficult, subjective judgment and are important to the presentation of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.\n o national and local economic trends and conditions; \n 47 \nAverage interest earning assets increased $46,378 and was funded principally by an increase in average noninterest-bearing demand deposits of $21,612 and an increase in average interest bearing deposits of $20,108. Average interest-earning assets for 2014 were $1,624,537 or 93.30% of average total assets.\n\nOverview\nNoninterest Expense\n 36 \nThe Company's commitments are funded through internal funding sources of scheduled repayments of loans and sales and maturities of investment securities available-for-sale or external funding sources through acceptance of deposits from customers or borrowings from other financial institutions.\n 33 \n2015 compared with 2014:\nOther operating expenses increased $1,290 or 9.98% and included an $888 increase in processing expense due to the migration to an outsourced mainframe computer system and a $428 increase in legal and professional fees due to regulatory compliance issues.\nThe allowance for loan losses represents an allocation for the estimated amount of probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. The Company has developed policies and procedures for evaluating the overall quality of its loan portfolio and the timely identification of problem credits. Management continues to review these policies and procedures and makes further improvements as needed. The adequacy of the Company's allowance for loan losses and the effectiveness of the Company's internal policies and procedures are also reviewed periodically by the Company's regulators and the Company's internal loan review personnel. The Company's regulators may advise the Company to recognize additions to the allowance based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. Such regulatory guidance is considered, and the Company may recognize additions to the allowance as a result.\n\nCash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities\nProvision for Loan Losses\n\nThe Company's approach to ALLL reserve calculation uses two distinct perspectives, the guidelines of using Financial Accounting Standards ASC 450 (Accounting for Contingencies) and ASC 310 (Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan, for individual loans). The process is generally as follows, with the same methodology applied to all classes of loans within the portfolio segments:\nInflation generally increases the cost of funds and operating overhead, and to the extent loans and other assets bear variable rates, the yields on such assets. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on the performance of a financial institution than the effects of general levels of inflation. Although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction and to the same extent as the prices of goods and services, increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates. In addition, inflation can increase a financial institution's cost of goods and services purchased, the cost of salaries and benefits, occupancy expense and similar items. Inflation and related increases in interest rates generally decrease the market value of investments and loans held and may adversely affect liquidity, earnings, and stockholders' equity. Mortgage originations and refinances tend to slow as interest rates increase, and can reduce the Company's earnings from such activities and the income from the sale of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market.\nTotal stockholders' equity was $169,913 at December 31, 2015, an increase of $14,627 or 9.42% from the previous year. The change in stockholders equity resulted from an increase in retained earnings of $15,348 partially offset by a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which decreased $1,282 from 2014 due primarily to a decrease in market values of investment securities available for sale. The Company purchased 400 and 1,282 shares of treasury stock in 2015 and 2014 at a cost of $11 and $32, respectively, which is shown as a reduction of stockholders' equity. The Company issued 1,131 and 794 shares of treasury stock in 2015 and 2014 at a price of $29 and $17, respectively, for the Director Stock Purchase Plan.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nFinancial Condition\nThe provision for loan losses is the charge to operating earnings necessary to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses. The Company has developed policies and procedures for evaluating the overall quality of its loan portfolio and the timely identification of problem credits. Management continues to review these policies and procedures and makes further improvements as needed. The adequacy of the Company's allowance for loan losses and the effectiveness of the Company's internal policies and procedures are also reviewed periodically by the Company's regulators and the Company's internal loan review personnel. The Company's regulators may advise the Company to recognize additions to the allowance based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. Such regulatory guidance is considered, and the Company may recognize additions to the allowance as a result.\nDeposits\nAssets acquired through or instead of loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. These assets are subsequently accounted for at lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. If fair value declines subsequent to foreclosure, a valuation allowance is recorded through expense. Operating costs after acquisition are expensed. Costs related to the development and improvement of real estate owned are capitalized.\nInterest earning asset yields declined 2 basis points from 3.75% in 2014 to 3.73% in 2015 while interest bearing liability rates declined 5 basis points from 0.64% in 2014 to 0.59% in 2015. As a result, the Company's average interest rate spread improved to 3.14% in 2015 as compared to 3.11% in 2014. The year over year decline in asset yields and liability costs were a result of low market interest rates. These factors have contributed to an improvement in the net interest margin from 3.20% in 2014 to 3.24% in 2015.\nOccupancy expense increased $278 or 7.47% in 2014 due primarily to increased depreciation expense associated with new computer and automated teller machines.\nInterest income on taxable investment securities increased $368 or 3.10% and interest income on tax-exempt investment securities increased $548 or 21.31%. Average taxable investment balances remained relatively flat while average tax-exempt investment balances increased $21,793 or 25.88%. The average yield on the taxable investment portfolio increased from 2.09% in 2014 to 2.16% in 2015 while the average yield on the tax-exempt investment portfolio declined from 3.05% in 2014 to 2.94% in 2015.\nForward-Looking Statements\nAsset/Liability Management, Interest Rate Sensitivity and Liquidity\nReturn on Equity and Assets\n 58 \n\n 54 \nOccupancy expense increased $178 or 4.45% in 2015 due primarily to increased depreciation expense associated with new equipment purchases.\nThe Company recorded net income of $19,395 in 2015 compared to $16,632 in 2014. The increase in net income is primarily attributable to a credit for loan losses of $1,628 compared to a provision for loan losses of $3,492 in 2014. In addition, net interest income increased $2,193 and gain on sales of loans increased $1,130. Partially offsetting these were a $2,552 increase in noninterest expense and investment securities losses of $1,043 compared to a gain of $825 in the prior year.\n 43 \nThis table indicates that the majority of time deposits of $100 or more have a maturity of less than twelve months. This is reflective of both the Company's market and recent interest rate environments. At December 31, 2015, the Company had $71,099 of brokered certificates of deposit that mature after 12 months.\nNonaccrual Loans\n 39 \nNet charge-offs totaled $2,511 at December 31, 2015, of which $2,234 were related to commercial real estate loans and $955 were related to commercial, financial and agricultural loans. Also included were net recoveries of $1,413 for acquisition, development and construction loans. The provisions for loan losses allocated to individual portfolio segments are affected by the calculation of average historical net loss rate factors and by the internal and external qualitative factors within each category.\nThe Company continues to refine the methodology on which the level of the allowance for loan losses is based, by comparing historical loss ratios utilized to actual experience and by classifying loans for analysis based on similar risk characteristics. Cash receipts for accruing loans are applied to principal and interest under the contractual terms of the loan agreement; however, cash receipts on impaired and nonaccrual loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are applied to principal and interest income depending upon the overall risk of principal loss to the Company.\nNet Interest Income\nAt December 31, 2015, the Bank was well above the minimum capital ratios required under the regulatory risk-based capital guidelines and was considered well capitalized. The following table presents the capital ratios for the Company and the Bank.\n 51 \nCritical Accounting Estimates\nGross interest income that would have been recorded for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 if non-accruing loans and accruing troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the year or since origination, if held for part of the year, was approximately $864, $973 and $1,224, respectively. The amount of interest income on these loans that was included in net income for December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was approximately $735, $400 and $945, respectively.\nNoninterest expense increased $2,552 or 5.87% in 2015 mostly due to a $1,337 increase in salaries and other personnel expense and a $955 prepayment penalty fee on an FHLB Advance. The operating efficiency ratio increased from 61.78% in 2014 to 62.29% in 2015.\nInterest expense totaled $8,227 for 2015 compared to $8,886 in 2014, a decrease of $659 or 7.42% due primarily to interest expense on deposits which decreased $462 from $6,252 in 2014 to $5,790 in 2015. This decrease in deposit interest expense was primarily attributable to a decrease in rates paid. The average rate paid on NOW accounts decreased from 0.28% in 2014 to 0.27% in 2015. The average rate paid on savings and money management accounts decreased from 0.31% in 2014 to 0.29% in 2015 and the average rate paid on time deposits decreased from 0.92% in 2014 to 0.85% in 2015. The mix of interest bearing deposits also affects the interest rate spread. During 2015 average time deposits decreased $22,278 while average NOW accounts increased $19,105 and average savings and money management accounts increased $16,986.\n \u00b7 Loans are grouped in categories of similar risk characteristics (portfolio segments). \nInterest income is the largest contributor to income and totaled $60,950 in 2014 compared to $62,314 in 2013, a decrease of $1,364 or 2.19%. The largest component is interest income on loans, including loan fees, which decreased slightly from $46,479 in 2013 to $46,444 in 2014. The decline was due primarily to lower average yields which declined from 5.21% in 2013 to 4.86% in 2014. The average yield decreased in part due to the low interest rate environment for new and renewing loans. The Company has attempted to slow the decline in yields by enforcing established floors on loans but as loans mature the yields have fallen due to competitive reasons.\nOn a quarterly basis, a twenty-four month simulation of net interest income is performed, as well as the economic value of equity, based upon level plus and minus 100, 200, 300, and 400 basis point shocks. The primary method is a static simulation model based on current exposures to interest rates and assumes a constant balance sheet with no new growth. The results of the shocks are presented to a Board Committee on a quarterly basis and compared to the related policy limits. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,\u201d for the net interest income simulation results for December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nInterest earning asset yields declined 20 basis points from 3.95% in 2013 to 3.75% in 2014 while interest bearing liability rates declined 6 basis points from 0.70% in 2013 to 0.64% in 2014. As a result the Company's average interest rate spread contracted to 3.11% in 2014 as compared to 3.25% in 2013. The year over year decline in asset yields and liability costs were a result of low market interest rates. These factors have contributed to a decrease in the net interest margin from 3.35% in 2013 to 3.20% in 2014.\nThe fair values for available-for-sale securities are generally based upon quoted market prices or observable market prices for similar instruments. These values take into account recent market activity as well as other market observable data such as interest rate, spread and prepayment information. When market observable data is not available, which generally occurs due to the lack of liquidity for certain securities, the valuation of the security is subjective and may involve substantial judgment. The Company conducts periodic reviews to identify and evaluate each available-for-sale security that has an unrealized loss for other-than-temporary impairment. An unrealized loss exists when the fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis. The primary factors the Company considers in determining whether an impairment is other-than-temporary are the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer and whether the Company intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had no securities valued using unobservable inputs (Level 3).\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $26,975 in 2015, an increase of $8,279 from 2014. Net cash provided by operating activities was $18,696 in 2014, a decrease of $30,631 from 2013.\nThe Company meets its liquidity needs by managing cash and due from banks, federal funds purchased and sold, maturity of investment securities, principal repayments received from mortgage-backed securities, and draws on lines of credit. Additionally, liquidity can be managed through structuring deposit and loan maturities. The Company funds loan and investment growth with core deposits, securities sold under repurchase agreements, Federal Home Loan Bank advances and other wholesale funding including brokered certificates of deposit. During inflationary periods, interest rates generally increase and operating expenses generally rise. When interest rates rise, variable rate loans and investments produce higher earnings; however, deposit and other borrowings interest expense also rise. The Company monitors its interest rate risk as it applies to net interest income in various simulations up and down 400 basis points (4.00%) and as it applies to economic value of equity in a shock up and down 400 basis points (4.00%) scenario. The Company monitors operating expenses through responsibility center budgeting. See -Interest Rate Sensitivity\u201d below.\nInvestment Securities\nOther Real Estate Owned\nThe fair value of interest rate swap derivatives is determined based on discounted cash flow valuation models using observable market data as of the measurement date. The fair value adjustment is included in other liabilities. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d herein for additional disclosures regarding the fair value of financial instruments.\nThe following table presents the return on equity and assets for the years 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nNoninterest income decreased $342 in 2015 and was due primarily to investment securities losses of $1,043, partially offset by increased gain on sales of loans of $1,130. Also offsetting the investment losses were increased service charges and deposit fees of $135, trust service fees, which increased $98, and cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance, which increased $96.\nInterest income on taxable investment securities declined $1,050 or 8.13% and interest income on tax-exempt investment securities decreased $275 or 9.66%. Average taxable and tax-exempt investment balances decreased $4,826 and $3,805 or 0.84% and 4.32%, respectively, but the effect on income was less severe than the decline in the average portfolio yield. The average yield on the taxable investment portfolio declined from 2.26% in 2013 to 2.09% in 2014 and the average yield on the tax-exempt investment portfolio declined from 3.23% in 2013 to 3.05% in 2014. Yields on investments purchased during the year were generally lower in 2014 and were impacted by a high level of proceeds from maturities and calls and sales of available for sale securities which totaled $76,649 and $211,188, respectively. Some securities sales occurred based on asset liability strategies.\nIn 2015 growth in loans occurred in most categories, but primarily in residential real estate loans which increased $25,064 or 12.28% and acquisition, development and construction loans which increased $19,989 or 12.17%. Residential loans increased as the Bank elected to hold some permanent mortgages on its books and the increase in acquisition, development and construction loans occurred in its primary market area mainly in the fourth quarter of 2015. In response to the economic environment over the last several years, management curtailed the origination and participation of new out of market ADC lending opportunities. As a result, the out of market ADC portfolio decreased $11,044 or 20.37% in 2015.\nInterest Rate Swap Derivatives\nOther Real Estate Owned\n 42 \nThe variances for each major category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are attributable to (a) changes in volume (changes in volume times prior year rate), (b) changes in rate (changes in rate times prior year volume) and (c) combined (changes in rate times the change in volume).\nThe overall result was a decrease in net interest income of $736 or 1.39% in 2014 over 2013 due to asset yields declining faster than liability costs partially offset by an increase in volume of average interest earning assets.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations\nOther operating expenses increased $412 or 2.90% and included a $428 increase in processing expense due in part to the migration to an outsourced mainframe computer system and a $552 increase in operational losses due primarily to fraudulent charges on customer debit cards partially offset by a $490 decrease in loan costs excluding OREO.\nInvestment Securities\n 48 \n\n\nInterest income is the largest contributor to income and totaled $62,484 in 2015 compared to $60,950 in 2014, an increase of $1,534 or 2.52%. The largest component is interest income on loans, including loan fees, which increased slightly from $45,844 in 2014 to $46,291 in 2015. The increase was due primarily to higher average balances which increased from $942,636 in 2014 to $966,651 in 2015. Partially offsetting these higher balances were declining yields, which dropped from 4.86% in 2014 to 4.79% in 2015. The average yield decreased in part due to the low interest rate environment for new and renewing loans. The Company has attempted to slow the decline in yields by enforcing established floors on loans but as loans mature the yields have fallen due to competitive reasons.\nNoninterest expense totaled $46,040 in 2015, an increase of $2,552 or 5.87% over 2014. The primary reasons for the increase were salaries and other personnel expense, which increased $1,337, and a $955 prepayment penalty fee on an FHLB Advance during the second quarter of 2015.\nSalaries and other personnel expense increased $1,337 or 5.34%. The increase was attributable in large part to salary increases, increased incentive compensation and commission expense. These increases were partially offset by a $966 reduction in deferred compensation expense caused by an increase in the discount rate used to value the salary continuation liability.\nThe following table presents the maturities of the Company's time deposits over $100 at December 31, 2015:\n 60 \nNet cash provided by financing activities in 2015 was $86,314 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $13,908 in 2014. The primary reason for the change was a $65,216 increase in deposits and a $21,000 net increase in FHLB advances. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2014 was $13,908 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $30,850 in 2013. Contributing to this change was an increase in deposits of $9,061 and an increase in federal funds purchased and securities sold of $9,870.\nThe table below presents a roll forward of other real estate owned for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n 49 \nThe Company's primary source of income is from its lending activities followed by interest income from its investment activities, service charges and fees on deposits, and gain on sales of mortgage loans in the secondary market. Despite declining yields, interest income on loans increased slightly due to increased volumes in the loan portfolio. Interest income on investment securities increased $916 or 6.34% due to increased volume and yields. In addition, gain on sales of mortgage loans increased $1,130 or 20.68% due to increased mortgage originations and refinancing activity in 2015.\nAt December 31, 2015 there were $127 of loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing. There were no loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing at December 31, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011. All loans past due 90 days or more are classified as nonaccrual loans unless lending management believes the loan is well-secured and in process of collection, in which case the loan continues to accrue interest.\nANALYSIS OF CAPITAL\n \u00b7 The total of each loan pool is then added to the ALLL determined for individual loans evaluated for impairment in accordance with ASC 310. \nThe following table provides details regarding charge-offs and recoveries by loan category during the most recent five year period, as well as supplemental information relating to both net loan losses, the provision and the allowance for loan losses during each of the past five years. Net charge-offs for 2015 represented 0.26% of average loans outstanding, compared to 0.47% for 2014 and 1.12% for 2013.\n 44 \n\n 55 \n o experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; \n\n 41 \nUnfunded commitments to extend credit where contractual amounts represent potential credit risk totaled $226,331 and $171,911 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This includes standby letters of credit of $4,494 at December 31, 2015 and $5,730 at December 31, 2014. These commitments are primarily at variable interest rates.\n2014 compared with 2013:\nNon-performing assets include nonaccrual loans, restructured loans and other real estate owned. The following table, Non-Performing Assets\u201d, presents information on these assets as of December 31st, for the past five years. Non-performing assets were $17,766 at December 31, 2015 or 1.76% of period end loans and other real estate owned. This compares to $21,903 or 2.26% of total loans and other real estate owned at December 31, 2014.\n o changes in the value of underlying collateral; \nIn addition to loans disclosed above as past due, nonaccrual and restructured as of December 31, 2015, management identified weaknesses in $6,641 of classified loans. These loans, principally classified for regulatory purposes as substandard, are principally commercial real estate loans in the company's primary market area. Estimated probable incurred losses from these potential credit weaknesses have been provided for in determining the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2015.\nDue to the added risks associated with loans, which are graded as special mention or substandard, that are not classified as impaired, the qualitative factor adjustment is further increased for such classifications within each category.\nAllocation of the Allowance for Loan Loss\nManagement of the Company's liquidity position is closely related to the process of asset/liability management. Liquidity represents the ability to provide steady sources of funds for loan commitments and investment activities, as well as to provide sufficient funds to cover deposit withdrawals and payment of debt and operating obligations. The Company intends to meet its liquidity needs by managing cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and purchased, maturity of investment securities, principal repayments received from mortgage-backed securities and lines of credit as necessary. GB&T maintains a line of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank approximating 10% of its total assets. Federal Home Loan Bank advances are collateralized by eligible first mortgages, commercial real estate loans and investment securities. GB&T maintains repurchase lines of credit with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Atlanta, Georgia, for advances up to $30,000 of which $15,000 was outstanding at December 31, 2015 and a $10,000 repurchase line of credit with CenterState Bank, Orlando, Florida, of which none was outstanding at December 31, 2015. GB&T has a federal funds purchased accommodation with SunTrust Bank, Atlanta, Georgia, for advances up to $10,000, of which none was outstanding at December 31, 2015 and a federal funds purchased accommodation with CenterState Bank, Orlando, Florida, for advances up to $10,000, of which none was outstanding at December 31, 2015. The Company also maintains a borrowing facility at the Federal Reserve Bank, under the Borrower-In-Custody Program, of which none was outstanding at December 31, 2015. Additionally, liquidity needs can be supplemented by the structuring of the maturities of investment securities and the pricing and maturities on loans and deposits offered to customers. The Company also uses retail securities sold under repurchase agreements to fund operations. Retail securities sold under repurchase agreements were $684 at December 31, 2015.\n\n 57 \nNoninterest Expense\nManagement considers the current allowance appropriate based upon its analysis of risk in the portfolio using the methods previously discussed. Management's judgment is based upon a number of assumptions about events which are believed to be reasonable, but which may or may not prove correct. While it is the Company's policy to charge off in the current period the loans in which a loss is considered probable, there are additional risks of losses which cannot be quantified precisely or attributed to a particular loan or class of loans. Because management evaluates such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, historical loss rates, overall portfolio quality, review of specific problem loans, and current economic conditions and trends that may affect a borrower's ability to repay, management's judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance is necessarily approximate and imprecise. Thus, there can be no assurance that charge-offs in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses or that additional increases in the allowance will not be required. See Critical Accounting Estimates.\u201d\nThe allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, which affects the Company's earnings directly. Loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance. The allowance is an amount that reflects management's estimate of the level of probable incurred losses in the portfolio. Factors considered by management in determining the adequacy of the allowance include, but are not limited to: (1) detailed reviews of individual loans; (2) historical and current trends in loan charge-offs for the various portfolio segments evaluated; (3) the level of the allowance in relation to total loans and to historical loss levels; (4) levels and trends in non-performing and past due loans; (5) collateral values of properties securing loans; and (6) management's assessment of economic conditions. The Company's Board of Directors reviews the recommendations of management regarding the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses based upon these factors.\nLoans outstanding averaged $966,651 in 2015 compared to $942,636 in 2014 and $880,565 in 2013. At December 31, 2015, loans totaled $1,009,149 compared to $966,356 at December 31, 2014, an increase of $42,793 or 4.43%.\n 50 \nChanges in the net interest income from period to period result from increases or decreases in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, increases or decreases in the average rates earned and paid on such assets and liabilities, the ability to manage the earning asset portfolio, and the availability of particular sources of funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits. The following table: Analysis of Changes in Net Interest Income\u201d indicates the changes in the Company's net interest income as a result of changes in volume and rate from 2014 to 2015, and from 2013 to 2014. The low interest rate environment in 2015 resulted in continued decreases in yields on interest-earning assets, but also in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The analysis indicates that, on an overall basis in 2015, increased volumes of interest-earning assets created a positive impact on income but was partially offset by decreases in average rates earned. When combined with reduced expense due to lower average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities, the result was an increase in net interest income of $2,193. In 2014, decreases in average rates on interest earning assets reduced income more than the positive effect of increased volumes. Lower average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities reduced expense, but not enough to offset the reduction in income resulting in a decrease in net interest income of $736.\n 45 \nThe following table sets forth the composition of the Company's loan portfolio as of December 31st for the past five years. The Company's loan portfolio does not contain any concentrations of loans exceeding 10% of total loans which are not otherwise disclosed as a category of loans in this table. The Company has not invested in loans to finance highly-leveraged transactions (\"HLT\"), such as leveraged buy-out transactions, as defined by the Federal Reserve and other regulatory agencies. Loans made by a bank for recapitalization or acquisitions (including acquisitions by management or employees) which result in a material change in the borrower's financial structure to a highly-leveraged condition are considered HLT loans. The Company had no foreign loans or loans to lesser-developed countries as of December 31st of any of the years presented.\nThe Company's Board of Directors, with the recommendation of management, approves the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses based upon internal policies and procedures, historical loan loss ratios, loan volume, size and character of the loan portfolio, concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries, value of the collateral underlying the loans, specific problem loans and present or anticipated economic conditions and trends. The Company continues to refine the methodology on which the level of the allowance for loan losses is based, by comparing historical loss ratios utilized to actual experience and by classifying loans for analysis based on similar risk characteristics.\n2015 compared with 2014:\nNoninterest Income\n\nNoninterest income consists of revenues generated from a broad range of financial services and activities, including service charges on deposit accounts, gain on sales of loans, fee-based services, and products where commissions are earned through sales of products such as real estate mortgages, retail investment services, trust services, and other activities. In addition, increases in cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance, gain on sale of fixed assets, gains or losses realized from the sale of investment securities and other-than-temporary losses are included in noninterest income.\n\nInterest expense decreased $659 or 7.42% to $8,227 in 2015. Interest expense on deposits decreased $462 or 7.39% to $5,790 and was due primarily to declines in rates paid on deposits and a $22,278 decline in average time deposits. Due to the low interest rate environment many customers have transferred out of time deposits to more liquid NOW and savings accounts. Brokered CDs decreased $28,914 or 15.37% and totaled $159,180 at year end 2015.\n2015 compared with 2014:\n(1) Restructured loans on nonaccrual status at year end are included under nonaccrual loans in the table.\nEffects of Inflation and Changing Prices\n\nLoans may be periodically renewed with principal reductions and appropriate interest rate adjustments. Loan maturities as of December 31, 2015 are set forth in the following table based upon contractual terms. Actual cash flows may differ as borrowers generally have the right to prepay without prepayment penalties.\nPlease see Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d and Non-Performing Assets\u201d for a further discussion of the Company's loans, loss experience, and methodology in determining the allowance.\nLoan Portfolio Composition\nThe table below indicates the allocated allowance for all loans according to loan type determined through the Company's comprehensive allowance methodology for the years indicated. Because these allocations are based upon estimates and subjective judgment, it is not necessarily indicative of the specific amounts or loan categories in which loan losses may occur.\nThese objectives are achieved through compliance with an established framework of asset/liability, interest rate risk, loan, investment, and capital policies. Management is responsible for monitoring policies and procedures that result in proper management of the components of the asset/liability function to achieve stated objectives. The Company's philosophy is to support quality asset growth primarily through growth of core deposits, which include non-volatile deposits of individuals, partnerships and corporations. Management seeks to invest the largest portion of the Company's assets in loans that meet the Company's quality standards. Alternative investments are made in the investment portfolio. The Company's asset/liability function and related components of liquidity and interest rate risk are monitored on a continuous basis by management. The Board of Directors reviews and monitors these functions on a monthly basis.\n o levels and trends in delinquencies and impaired/classified/graded loans; \nNoninterest income totaled $18,688 in 2015 compared to $19,030 in 2014, a decrease of $342 or 1.80%. The decrease was due primarily to investment securities losses of $1,043 in 2015 compared to investment gains of $825 in 2014. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in gain on sales of loans, which increased $1,130 or 20.68% due to increased mortgage originations and refinancing activity. Other factors included an increase in service charges and deposit fees of $135, and increase in trust service fees of $98 and an increase in cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance of $96.\n\n 35 \nGeneral. It is the objective of the Company to manage assets and liabilities to preserve the integrity and safety of the deposit and capital base of the Company by protecting the Company from undue exposure to poor asset quality and interest rate risk. Additionally, the Company pursues a consistent level of earnings as further protection for the depositors and to provide an appropriate return to stockholders on their investment.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\n\n(1) Tax-equivalent yield\n\nIncome Taxes\nCapital\nThe Company continues to focus on the net interest margin, regulatory capital requirements, liquidity management, risk mitigation and expense control. Problem asset resolution, new consumer disclosure regulations, upgrades to operating systems, balance sheet management and investment purchases have been key areas of focus in 2015.\nNoninterest Income\n\n 56 \n o trends in volume and terms of loans; \nNet cash used in investing activities was $106,367 in 2015 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $43,945 in 2014. The change was primarily due to growth in the investment portfolio in 2015 as compared to 2014. Net cash used in investing activities was $43,945 in 2014 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $76,729 in 2013. Changes included a lower investment securities portfolio in 2014 compared to 2013 and an increase in loans. Loans increased $61,963 in 2014 compared to an increase in loans of $44,929 in 2013.\n o changes in the quality of the loan review system; \nNet income in 2015 was $19,395 compared to $16,632 in 2014. Earnings were positively impacted by a $1,628 credit for loan losses, primarily due to the repayment of a previously written down impaired loan during the second quarter of 2015 that resulted in a $1,666 recovery. In addition, net interest income increased $2,193 and gain on sales of loans increased $1,130. These increases were partially offset by a $2,552 increase in noninterest expense and investment securities losses of $1,043 compared to gains of $825 in the prior year.\nThe table below provides additional detail on nonaccrual loans greater than $1,000 at December 31, 2015.\nThe following table presents the principal components of noninterest income for the last three years:\nVarious information shown elsewhere herein will assist in the understanding of how well the Company is positioned to react to changing interest rates and inflationary trends. In particular, the summary of net interest income, the maturity distributions and compositions of the loan and security portfolios and the data on the interest sensitivity of loans and deposits should be considered.\nLiquidity\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities increased $17,912 or 1.31% from 2013 to 2014, while average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $21,612 or 12.41% during the same period.\nSensitivity of Loans to Changes in Interest Rates\n 34 \n2014 compared with 2013:\nThe Company may, from time to time, make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission\u201d) and its reports to shareholders. Statements made in such documents, other than those concerning historical information, should be considered forward-looking and subject to various risks and uncertainties. Such forward-looking statements are made based upon management's belief as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management pursuant to safe harbor\u201d provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including unanticipated changes in the Company's local economies, the national economy, governmental monetary and fiscal policies, deposit levels, loan demand, loan collateral values and securities portfolio values; difficulties in interest rate risk management; the effects of competition in the banking business; difficulties in expanding the Company's business into new markets; changes in governmental regulation relating to the banking industry, including but not limited to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the Basel III international capital accord; failure of assumptions underlying the establishment of reserves for loan losses, including the value of collateral underlying delinquent loans; and other factors. The Company cautions that such factors are not exclusive. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that may be made from time to time by, or on behalf of, the Company.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe following table is a summary of the Company's commitments to extend credit, commitments under contractual leases as well as the Company' contractual obligations, consisting of deposits, FHLB advances, which are subject to early termination options, borrowed funds and benefit plans by contractual maturity date.\n \u00b7 The resultant loss factor is applied to each respective loan pool to calculate the ALLL for each loan pool. \n\n2014 compared with 2013:\nThe Company's average interest bearing liabilities increased $15,660 or 1.13% from 2014 to 2015. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $24,601 or 12.57%. Average borrowings increased $1,847 or 2.15% from 2014 to 2015. The majority of the growth in deposits reflects the Company's strategy of consistently emphasizing deposit growth, as deposits are the primary source of funding for balance sheet growth. Borrowed funds consist of short-term borrowings, securities sold under agreements to repurchase with the Company's commercial customers and reverse repurchase agreements with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey and CenterState Bank, federal funds purchased, subordinated debentures and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank.\nInvestment Securities\nMaturity Distribution and Yields of Investment Securities\nNoninterest income totaled $19,030 in 2014 compared to $18,497 in 2013, an increase of $533 or 2.88%. The increase was due primarily to increased investment securities gains of $1,720 partially offset by decreased gain on sales of loans, which decreased $1,378 or 20.14% due to lower volume of loans originated for sale in 2014 compared to 2013. Other factors included an increase in trust service fees of $125 and an increase in retail investment income of $89.\nInterest income increased $1,534 or 2.52% to $62,484 in 2015. Interest income on tax-exempt investment securities increased $548 or 21.31% primarily due to an increase in average balance of $21,793 or 25.88%. Interest income on taxable investment securities increased $368 or 3.10% in 2015 caused primarily by an increase in yield. The average rate on taxable investments increased from 2.09% in 2014 to 2.16% in 2015, an increase of 7 basis points. Interest income on loans increased $447 from 2014 due to an increase in average balance partially offset by a decline in yield. Average loans increased from $942,636 in 2014 to $966,651 in 2015, an increase of $24,015 or 2.55%. The average rate on loans dropped from 4.86% in 2014 to 4.79% in 2015, a decrease of 7 basis points.\nAlthough management regularly monitors the balance of outstanding commitments to fund loans to ensure funding availability should the need arise, management believes that the risk of all customers fully drawing on all these lines of credit at the same time is remote.\nAdoption of New Accounting Standards\nResults of Operations\n\n(1) Percent of gross loans in each category to total loans adjusted for loans recorded at fair value\nAdditions to the allowance for loan losses, which are expensed on the Company's income statement as the provision for loan losses\u201d, are made periodically to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level based upon management's analysis of risk in the loan portfolio. The Company had a credit for loan losses of $1,628 in 2015 compared to a provision of $3,492 in 2014. The credit in 2015 resulted primarily from a $1,666 recovery in the second quarter of 2015 related to the repayment of a previously written-down impaired loan.\nThe Company is required to identify impaired loans and evaluate the collectability of both contractual interest and principal of loans when assessing the need for a loss allowance. Large pools of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment. A loan is considered impaired, when based upon current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the note agreement. The amount of the impairment is measured based on the present value of future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or, if the loan is collateral dependent or foreclosure is probable, the fair value of collateral, less estimated selling expenses. Regulatory guidance is also considered. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had total impaired loans of $15,472 and $20,189, respectively, which includes loans carried at fair value with a recorded investment of $10,171 and $11,730, respectively at December 31, 2015 and 2014. Charge-offs of $3,546 and $1,831 were taken on these impaired loans during 2015 and 2014.\n 46 \nAs a result of management's ongoing review of the loan portfolio, loans are classified as nonaccrual when it is not reasonable to expect collections of interest and principal under the original terms, generally when a loan becomes 90 days or more past due. These loans are classified as nonaccrual, even though the presence of collateral or the borrower's financial strength may be sufficient to provide for ultimate repayment. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual, the interest which has been accrued but remains unpaid is reversed and deducted from current period interest income. No additional interest is accrued and recognized as income on the loan balance until the collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain. Also, there may be write downs, and ultimately, the total charge-off of the principal balance of the loan, which could necessitate additional charges to earnings through the provision for loan

the financial condition and results of operations for a company. Key points:\n\n- The report analyzes changes in net interest income, highlighting the impact of changes in volume and rates on interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. In 2015, increased loan volumes helped net interest income, but lower asset yields had a negative impact. \n\n- The provision for loan losses was a credit of $1.6 million in 2015, compared to a provision of $3.5 million in 2014. This was due to the repayment of a previously written down impaired loan.\n\n- Noninterest income decreased $0.3 million in 2015, primarily due to investment securities losses compared to gains in 2014. This was partially offset by higher gains on sales of loans.\n\n- Noninterest expense increased $2.6 million in 2015, largely driven by higher salaries and a prepayment penalty on an FHLB advance. \n\n- Net income increased to $19.4 million in 2015 versus $16.6 million in 2014, helped by the loan loss provision credit and higher net interest income.\n\n- Total loans increased 4.4% in 2015, with growth across most categories. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans decreased.\n\n- The company's capital ratios exceeded regulatory requirements for a well-capitalized institution. \n\nIn summary, the company showed improved financial performance in 2015 driven by loan growth, higher net interest income, and a credit for loan losses. Asset quality improved as indicated by the lower loan loss provision. The report provides insight into the drivers of the company's financial results during the year."}
