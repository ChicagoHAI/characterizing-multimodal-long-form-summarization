We are a majority-owned subsidiary of Oncor Holdings, which is indirectly and wholly owned by Sempra. Oncor Holdings owns 80.25% of our outstanding membership interests and Texas Transmission owns 19.75% of our outstanding membership interests. We are managed as an integrated business; consequently, there is only one reportable segment.\n\ufeff\nOur consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, include the results of our wholly owned, indirect subsidiary, NTU, which is a regulated utility that provides electricity transmission delivery service in the north-central, western and panhandle regions of Texas. We acquired NTU as part of the InfraREIT Acquisition that closed on May 16, 2019.\n\ufeff\nRing-Fencing Measures\n\ufeff\nVarious ring-fencing measures have been taken to enhance our credit quality and the separateness between the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities, Sempra and its affiliates (other than the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities), and any other entities with a direct or indirect ownership interest in Oncor or Oncor Holdings. These measures serve to mitigate the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities' credit exposure to Sempra and its affiliates and any other direct or indirect owners of Oncor and Oncor Holdings, and to reduce the risk that the assets and liabilities of Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities would be substantively consolidated with the assets and liabilities of any Sempra entity or any other direct or indirect owners of Oncor and Oncor Holdings in connection with a bankruptcy of any such entities. Such measures include, among other things: the 19.75% equity interest held by Texas Transmission; maintenance of separate books and records for the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities; and our board of directors being comprised of a majority of directors who meet certain disinterested director standards. As a result, none of the assets of the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities are available to satisfy the debt or obligations of any Sempra entity or any other direct or indirect owner of Oncor or Oncor Holdings. The assets and liabilities of the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities are separate and distinct from those of any Sempra entities and any other direct or indirect owner of Oncor or Oncor Holdings. We do not bear any liability for debt or contractual obligations of Sempra and its affiliates or any other direct or indirect owner of Oncor or Oncor Holdings, and vice versa. Accordingly, our operations are conducted, and our cash flows are managed, independently from Sempra and its affiliates and any other direct or indirect owner of Oncor or Oncor Holdings. For more information on the ring-fencing measures, see Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties - Ring-Fencing Measures.\u201d\n\ufeff\nSignificant Activities and Events\n\ufeff\nInfraREIT Acquisition - On May 16, 2019, we completed the InfraREIT Acquisition, pursuant to which we acquired all of the equity interests of InfraREIT and its subsidiary, InfraREIT Partners. The cash consideration paid to stockholders of InfraREIT and limited partners of InfraREIT Partners totaled $1,275 million. In addition, we paid certain transaction costs incurred by InfraREIT (including a management agreement termination fee of $40 million that InfraREIT paid an affiliate of Hunt Consolidated, Inc. at closing), with the aggregate cash consideration and payment of certain InfraREIT expenses totaling $1,324 million. In connection with and immediately after the closing of the InfraREIT Acquisition, on May 16, 2019, we also extinguished all $953 million aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt of\nInfraREIT and its subsidiaries through repayment of $602 million of InfraREIT subsidiary debt and the exchange of $351 million of InfraREIT subsidiary debt for newly issued Oncor senior secured notes. See Notes 2, 6 and 7 to Financial Statements for more information on the exchange of notes and repayment of debt of InfraREIT and its subsidiaries.\n\ufeff\nThe InfraREIT Acquisition expanded Oncor's existing footprint in Texas by adding various electricity transmission and distribution assets and projects in the north, central, west and panhandle regions of Texas. Among those projects is an approximately $400 million joint project with Lubbock Power & Light (LP&L), with costs and investment to ultimately be split equally by Oncor and LP&L, which involves the build out of transmission lines and associated station work to join most of the City of Lubbock electric facilities to the ERCOT market. Oncor is responsible for construction of the project and invoices LP&L on a monthly basis for LP&L's portion of the costs. Oncor ultimately funded approximately $3 million and LP&L ultimately funded $3 million through reimbursement to Oncor of the project in 2019, with the remainder to be spent in 2020 and 2021. The project requires approval of four Certificates of Convenience and Necessity by the PUCT, three of which have received final approval (PUCT Docket Nos. 48625, 48668 and 48909) and one of which is pending (PUCT Docket No. 49151). This joint project consists of approximately 175 miles of transmission lines in Lubbock and surrounding areas.\n\ufeff\nDebt-Related Activity - In May 2019, we issued (i) $351 million of senior secured notes under the Note Purchase Agreements in exchange for a like principal amount of notes issued by InfraREIT subsidiaries, (ii) $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.75% senior secured notes due 2024 (2024 Notes), (iii) $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.70% senior secured notes due 2028 (2028 Notes) and (iv) $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.80% senior secured notes due 2049 (3.80% 2049 Notes). In September 2019, we (i) issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of 3.10% senior secured notes due 2049 (3.10% 2049 Notes) and (ii) entered in to and borrowed $460 million under a term loan credit agreement that matures on October 6, 2020. Repayments of long-term debt consisted of $488 million aggregate principal amount of certain InfraREIT-related long-term debt in connection with and immediately following the closing of the InfraREIT Acquisition, $250 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes, $350 million aggregate principal amount under a previous term loan credit agreement and $6 million principal amount of the quarterly amortizing debt for our notes issued under the Note Purchase Agreements. See Note 7 to Financial Statements for additional information regarding long-term debt.\n\ufeff\nIn May 2019, we entered into the short-term Bridge Loan, borrowing an aggregate principal amount of $600 million, which was subsequently repaid on May 23, 2019. In connection with the closing of the InfraREIT Acquisition, on May 16, 2019, the short-term credit facilities of InfraREIT and its subsidiaries were terminated and borrowings totaling $114 million aggregate principal amount were repaid in full by Oncor. See Note 6 to Financial Statements for additional information regarding short-term debt and Note 2 to Financial Statements regarding the InfraREIT Acquisition.\nMatters with the PUCT - See discussion below under Regulation and Rates - Matters with the PUCT\u201d.\n\ufeff\nKEY RISKS AND CHALLENGES\n\ufeff\nFollowing is a discussion of key risks and challenges facing management and the initiatives currently underway to manage such challenges. For additional information concerning risk factors related to our business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in this report.\n\ufeff\nRates and Cost Recovery\n\ufeff\nOur rates are regulated by the PUCT and certain cities and are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and annual earnings oversight. This regulatory treatment does not provide any assurance as to achievement of earnings levels. Our rates are regulated based on an analysis of our costs and capital structure, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding. Rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. However, there is no assurance that the PUCT will judge all of our costs to have been prudently incurred, that the PUCT will not reduce the amount of invested capital included in the capital structure that our rates are based upon, that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will always result in rates that produce full recovery of our costs or that our authorized return on equity will not be reduced. See Regulation and Rates\u201d below for further information.\n\ufeff\nCapital Availability and Cost\n\ufeff\nOur access to capital markets and cost of debt could be directly affected by our credit ratings. Any adverse action with respect to our credit ratings could generally cause borrowing costs to increase and the potential pool of investors and funding sources to decrease. Our credit ratings are currently higher than those of Sempra. If credit rating agencies were to change their views of our independence from Sempra and its affiliates (other than the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities), our credit ratings could decline. We believe this risk is substantially mitigated by the ring-fencing measures as described in Notes 1 and 2 to Financial Statements. See Risk Factors-Adverse actions with respect to our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital\u201d, and In the future, we could have liquidity needs that could be difficult to satisfy under some circumstances, especially in uncertain financial market conditions.\u201d\n\ufeff\nTechnology Risks\n\ufeff\nTechnology risks include the risk of interrupted and/or degraded business operations due to the loss of key technology platforms. Risks to our key technology platforms include nonperformance by equipment and service providers, failure of the technology to meet performance expectations and inadequate cost recovery allowances by regulatory authorities. We continue to implement measures to mitigate these risks, including business continuity and disaster recovery plans, but there can be no assurance that these measures will achieve the operational and financial objectives.\n\ufeff\nCyber Security and Infrastructure Protection Risk\n\ufeff\nA breach of our cyber/data or physical security measures that impairs our information technology infrastructure or transmission and distribution infrastructure could disrupt normal business operations, affect our ability to control our transmission and distribution system, expose us to material regulatory claims and limit communication with third parties. Any loss of confidential or proprietary data through a cyber/data breach, including a breach involving one of our third-party vendors, could also materially affect our reputation, expose the company to legal claims and fines or impair our ability to execute on business strategies. If third parties in our supply chain experience cyber attacks, the services they provide us could be disrupted. This disruption could interfere with our ability to perform our obligations to others, which could negatively affect our financial condition and reputation. In addition, the theft, damage, or improper disclosure of sensitive data held by these third parties may subject us to further harm. We participate in industry groups and with regulators to remain current on emerging threats and mitigating techniques. While we have not experienced any security breach with a significant operational, reputational or financial impact, we recognize the growing threat within our industry and are proactively taking steps to continuously improve our technology, security measures, processes and services to detect, mitigate and protect our assets, both physical and cyber.\n\ufeff\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\ufeff\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to Financial Statements. We prepare our financial statements in accordance with GAAP governing rate-regulated operations. Application of these accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reporting of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and revenues and expenses during the periods covered. The following is a summary of certain critical accounting policies that are impacted by judgments and uncertainties and under which different amounts might be reported using different assumptions or estimation methodologies.\n\ufeff\nAccounting for the Effects of Income Taxes\n\ufeff\nOur tax sharing agreement with Oncor Holdings, STH (as successor to EFH Corp.) and Texas Transmission provides for the calculation of amounts related to income taxes for each of Oncor Holdings and Oncor substantially as if these entities were taxed as corporations and requires payments to the members determined on that basis (without duplication for any income taxes paid by a subsidiary of Oncor Holdings).\n\ufeff\nWe are a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, while partnerships are not subject to income taxes, in consideration of the presentation of our financial statements as an entity subject to cost-based regulatory rate-setting processes with such costs historically including income taxes and the tax sharing agreement, the financial statements present amounts determined under the tax sharing agreement as provision in lieu of income taxes\u201d and liability in lieu of deferred income taxes\u201d. Such amounts are determined in accordance with the provisions of the accounting guidance for income taxes and accounting standards that provide interpretive guidance for accounting for uncertain tax positions and thus differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities are accounted for as if we were a stand-alone corporation. In the event such amounts are not paid under the tax sharing agreement, it is probable that this regulatory liability will continue to be included in Oncor's rate setting processes.\n\ufeff\nOur expense amounts related to income taxes and related balance sheet amounts are recorded pursuant to our tax sharing agreement, as discussed above. Recording of such amounts involves significant management estimates and judgments, including judgments and estimates of the timing and probability of recognition of income and deductions by taxing authorities. In assessing the likelihood of realization of assets related to income taxes, management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income. Actual amounts related to income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, our forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods, as well as final review of filed tax returns by taxing authorities. Our and STH's income tax returns are regularly subject to examination by applicable tax authorities. In management's opinion, any liability recorded pursuant to income tax accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions reflects future amounts that may be owed as a result of any examination.\n\ufeff\nAmounts payable to and receivable from members related to income taxes on our balance sheet reflect our tax provision net of quarterly estimated tax payments required by the tax sharing agreement that are trued up the following year when the annual tax return is filed.\n\ufeff\nSee Notes 1 and 5 to Financial Statements for additional information.\n\ufeff\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\n\ufeff\nWe are subject to rate regulation and our financial statements reflect regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with GAAP related to the effect of certain types of regulation. Regulatory assets and liabilities represent probable future revenues that will be recovered from or refunded to customers through the ratemaking process based on PURA and/or the PUCT's orders, precedents or substantive rules. Rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital subject to PUCT review for reasonableness and prudence and possible disallowance. Regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate earned on invested capital and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. See Note 3 to Financial Statements for more information regarding regulatory assets and liabilities.\n\ufeff\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill\n\ufeff\nWe evaluate long-lived assets (including intangible assets with finite lives) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\n\ufeff\nWe also evaluate goodwill for impairment annually on October 1 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. The determination of the existence of these and other indications of impairment involves judgments that are subjective in nature and may require the use of estimates in forecasting future results and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nIf at the assessment date our carrying value exceeds our estimated fair value (enterprise value), then the estimated enterprise value is compared to the estimated fair values of our operating assets (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities at the assessment date. The resultant implied goodwill amount is compared to the recorded goodwill amount. Any excess of the recorded goodwill amount over the implied goodwill amount is written off as an impairment charge.\n\ufeff\nIn each of 2019, 2018 and 2017, we concluded, based on a qualitative assessment, that our estimated enterprise fair value was more likely than not greater than our carrying value. As a result, no additional testing for impairment was required and no impairments were recognized.\n\ufeff\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans and OPEB Plans\n\ufeff\nWe offer certain pension, health care and life insurance benefits to eligible employees (and certain eligible former employees of EFH Corp. and Vistra whose service was partially assigned to Oncor in connection with the deregulation and disaggregation of EFH Corp.'s electric utility business in 2002) and their eligible dependents upon the retirement of such employees as we discuss in Note 10 to Financial Statements. We are authorized to establish a regulatory asset or liability for the difference between the amounts of pension and OPEB costs reflected in our PUCT-approved billing rates and the actual amounts that would otherwise have been recorded as charges or credits to earnings related to recoverable service. Accordingly, we recognize (principally as a regulatory asset or property) additional pension and OPEB costs consistent with PURA. Amounts deferred are ultimately subject to regulatory approval.\n\ufeff\nBenefit costs are impacted by actual and actuarial estimates of employee demographics (including but not limited to age, compensation levels and years of accredited service), future health care costs, the level of contributions made to retiree plans, expected and actual earnings on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation. Actuarial assumptions are reviewed and updated annually based on current economic conditions and trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future benefit costs. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased or decreased benefit costs in future periods.\n\ufeff\nIn accordance with accounting rules, changes in benefit obligations associated with factors discussed above may be immediately recognized as a regulatory asset if related to recoverable service or in other comprehensive income and reclassified as a current cost in future years. As such, significant portions of benefit costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants.\n\ufeff\nSee Note 10 to Financial Statements regarding other disclosures related to pension and OPEB plans obligations.\n\ufeff\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\ufeff\nOperating Data\n\ufeff\nTable 47: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td>

The increase includes $9 million higher labor and contractor related costs, $8 million in higher materials and transportation costs and $4 million higher energy efficiency program costs.\n\ufeff\nDepreciation and amortization increased $52 million to $723 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to ongoing investments in property, plant and equipment and $29 million from property, plant and equipment acquired in the InfraREIT Acquisition.\n\ufeff\nProvision in lieu of income taxes totaled $123 million (including a $15 million benefit related to nonoperating income) in 2019 compared to $117 million (including a $35 million benefit related to nonoperating income) in 2018.\n\ufeff\nThe effective income tax rate was 15.9% and 17.7% for the 2019 and 2018 periods, respectively. The effective tax rate on pretax income differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the amortization of the regulatory liability for excess deferred taxes as a result of the TCJA, partially offset by the effects of the Texas margin tax.\n\ufeff\nTaxes other than income taxes increased $12 million, or 2%, to $508 million in 2019. The increase is primarily due to $28 million higher property taxes in the current period including $16 million related to the InfraREIT Acquisition and $4 million higher local franchise fees, partially offset by $20 million expense in the prior period related to recovery of certain municipal franchise fees as part of the 2017 rate review.\nOther deductions and (income) - net was $21 million favorable in 2019 compared to 2018. The variance is primarily due to allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) equity income recorded in the current period and Sempra Acquisition related costs reflected in the prior period. See Note 13 to Financial Statements for more information.\n\ufeff\nInterest expense and related charges were $375 million and $351 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively. The $24 million increase is primarily driven by a $61 million increase due to higher average borrowings including $27 million related to the InfraREIT Acquisition, partially offset by a $36 million decrease attributable to lower average interest rates.\n\ufeff\nNet income was $106 million higher than the prior period, primarily driven by an increase in revenues that contribute to earnings, the impacts of the InfraREIT Acquisition and favorable other income including AFUDC equity, partially offset by increases in operation and maintenance expense, property taxes, depreciation and amortization and a TCJA related write-off in the prior period.\n\ufeff\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\n\ufeff\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\ufeff\nCash Flows - Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\n\ufeff\nCash provided by operating activities totaled $1,275 million and $1,482 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The $207 million decrease is primarily the result of a $162 million increase in storm costs, a $66 million decrease in transmission and distribution receipts, a $27 million increase in materials and supply purchases, and a $23 million increase in interest payments. The decreases were partially offset by $47 million of lower employee benefit plan funding and $15 million of higher stock-based compensation related payments in the prior period.\n\ufeff\nCash provided by financing activities totaled $2,104 million and $249 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The $1,855 million net increase includes debt restructuring activity in connection with the InfraREIT Acquisition that included new debt issuances and the receipt of capital contributions, partially offset by the extinguishment of certain debt of InfraREIT and its subsidiaries. The current period activity also includes an increase due to $1,160 million of new debt issuances, the repayment of all short-term debt and the repayment of Oncor senior secured notes that matured during the period. For more details, see Notes 6 and 7 to Financial Statements for additional information regarding short-term borrowings and long-term debt activity, respectively, and Note 9 to Financial Statements for additional information regarding capital contributions from our members.\n\ufeff\nCash used in investing activities totaled $3,378 million and $1,749 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The $1,629 million increase is primarily due to the $1,324 million purchase price paid for the InfraREIT Acquisition and a $330 million increase in capital expenditures for transmission and distribution facilities to serve new customers and infrastructure capital maintenance spending in the current period. The Other\u201d line includes proceeds of $18 million from the sale of certain distribution assets. For more details on the purchase price paid for the InfraREIT Acquisition, see Note 2 to Financial Statements.\n\ufeff\nDepreciation and amortization expense reported in the statements of consolidated cash flows was $83 million and $106 million more than the amounts reported in the statements of consolidated income for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The differences result from certain regulatory asset amortization reported in operation and maintenance expense and taxes other than income taxes.\n\ufeff\nLong-Term Debt Activity in 2019\n\ufeff\nSenior Secured Notes Issuances - In May 2019, we issued (i) $351 million of senior secured notes under the Note Purchase Agreements in exchange for a like principal amount of notes issued by InfraREIT subsidiaries, (ii) $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2024 Notes, (iii) $300 million aggregate principal amount of 2028 Notes and (iv) $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.80% 2049 Notes. In September 2019, we issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of 3.10% 2049 Notes (3.10% 2049 Notes and, together with the 2024 Notes, 2028 Notes and the 3.80% 2049 Notes, the New Indenture Notes).\n\ufeff\nLong-Term Unsecured Term Loan Credit Agreements - In September 2019, we executed a $460 million term loan credit agreement that matures on October 6, 2020 (2019 Term Loan Agreement). At December 31, 2019, we had outstanding borrowings of $460 million under the 2019 Term Loan Agreement bearing interest at a per annum rate equal to, at Oncor's option, (i) LIBOR plus 0.50%, or (ii) an alternate base rate (the highest of (1) the prime rate of Wells Fargo Bank National Association, the administrative agent under the agreement, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and (3) daily one-month LIBOR plus 1%). At December 31, 2019, we had outstanding borrowings of $460 million under the 2019 Term Loan Agreement bearing interest at the rate per annum of 2.28%. See Note 7 to Financial Statements for additional information regarding the 2019 Term Loan Agreement.\n\ufeff\nWe entered into a $350 million aggregate principal amount term loan credit agreement in December 2018 (2018 Term Loan Agreement) that was repaid in full in November 2019.\n\ufeff\nThe 2019 Term Loan Agreement contains customary covenants for facilities of this type, restricting, subject to certain exceptions, us and our subsidiaries from, among other things: incurring certain additional liens (not including liens relating to obligations secured pursuant to our Deed of Trust, which are permitted); entering into mergers and consolidations; sales\nof substantial assets and acquisitions and investments in subsidiaries. The 2019 Term Loan Agreement also contains a senior debt-to-capitalization ratio covenant that effectively limits our ability to incur indebtedness in the future. At December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with this covenant and all other covenants in the 2019 Term Loan Agreement. See Credit Rating Provisions, Covenants and Cross Default Provisions\u201d below for additional information on this covenant and the calculation of this ratio. While it was in effect, the 2018 Term Loan Agreement contained similar covenants to the 2019 Term Loan Agreement.\n\ufeff\nUse of Proceeds - We used the proceeds (net of the initial purchasers' discount, fees, expenses and accrued interest) of $2,446 million from the sale of the New Indenture Notes and borrowings on the 2019 Term Loan Agreement for general corporate purposes, including to repay all amounts outstanding under the Bridge Loan, to repay our $250 million aggregate principal amount of 2.15% Senior Secured Notes due June 1, 2019 and to repay CP Notes, when due, under our CP Program. For more information on the Bridge Loan, see Note 6 to Financial Statements. See Note 7 to Financial Statements for additional information regarding repayments, redemptions and issuances of long-term debt.\n\ufeff\nLong-Term Debt Repayments - Repayments of long-term debt during 2019 consisted of repayment of $488 million aggregate principal amount of certain InfraREIT-related long-term debt on May 16, 2019, in connection with and immediately following the closing of the InfraREIT Acquisition, $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.15% senior secured notes due June 1, 2019, $350 million aggregate principal amount under the 2018 Term Loan Agreement, and $6 million principal amount of the quarterly amortizing debt for our 2020 Notes, 2029 Notes and 2030 Notes.\n\ufeff\nAvailable Liquidity/CP Program/Credit Facility/Short-Term Borrowings\n\ufeff\nAvailable Liquidity - Our primary source of liquidity, aside from operating cash flows, has been our ability to borrow under our Credit Facility, which also supports our CP Program. Because the CP Program is supported by the Credit Facility, CP Notes outstanding is a reduction to the available borrowing capacity. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $4 million and $3 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Considering CP Notes and letters of credit outstanding, available liquidity (cash and available Credit Facility borrowing capacity) at December 31, 2019 totaled $1,948 million, reflecting an increase of $767 million from December 31, 2018 primarily due to the issuance of new long-term debt and the repayment of CP Notes.\n\ufeff\nCP Program - As discussed in Note 6 to Financial Statements, in March, 2018 we established the CP Program, under which we may issue unsecured CP Notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $2.0 billion. A national bank acts as the issuing and paying agent under the CP Program pursuant to the terms of an issuing and paying agent agreement. Under the CP Program, we issue CP Notes from time to time, and the proceeds of the CP Notes are used for short-term financing of our business operations. At December 31, 2019, we had $46 million of CP Notes outstanding under the CP Program.\n\ufeff\nThe CP Program obtains liquidity support from our Credit Facility discussed below. We may utilize either the CP Program or the Credit Facility at our option for funding. See Note 6 to Financial Statements for additional information regarding the CP Program.\n\ufeff\nCredit Facility - At December 31, 2019, we had a $2.0 billion unsecured Credit Facility to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, issuance of letters of credit and to support our CP Program with a five-year term expiring in November 2022. We have the option of requesting up to two one-year extensions and an option to request an increase in our borrowing capacity of $400 million, in increments of not less than $100 million, provided certain conditions are met, including lender approvals. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are classified as short-term on our balance sheets. At December 31, 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility.\n\ufeff\nBecause the CP Program is supported by the Credit Facility, CP Notes outstanding reduce the available borrowing capacity. Considering the CP Notes outstanding and the limitations described below, available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility totaled $1,944 million and $1,178 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\ufeff\nThe Credit Facility contains customary covenants for facilities of this type, restricting, subject to certain exceptions, us and our subsidiaries from, among other things: incurring certain additional liens (not including liens relating to obligations secured pursuant to our Deed of Trust, which are permitted); entering into mergers and consolidations; sales of substantial assets and acquisitions and investments in subsidiaries. The Credit Facility also contains a senior debt-to-capitalization ratio covenant that effectively limits our ability to incur indebtedness in the future. At December 31, 2019,\nwe were in compliance with all covenants in the Credit Facility. See Credit Rating Provisions, Covenants and Cross Default Provisions\u201d below for additional information on this covenant and the calculation of this ratio.\n\ufeff\nUnder the terms of the Credit Facility, the commitments of the lenders to make loans to us are several and not joint. Accordingly, if any lender fails to make loans to us, our available liquidity could be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender's commitments under the facility. See Note 6 to Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Credit Facility.\n\ufeff\nMay 2019 Short-Term Bridge Loan - On May 9, 2019, we entered into the Bridge Loan, a short-term, unsecured term loan credit agreement in an aggregate principal amount of up to $600 million in connection with the InfraREIT Acquisition. The Bridge Loan had a six-month term, maturing on November 9, 2019. We borrowed $600 million under the Bridge Loan on May 15, 2019 and used the proceeds to repay certain debt of InfraREIT subsidiaries. We repaid all outstanding amounts under the Bridge Loan in full on May 23, 2019, and as a result the Bridge Loan is no longer in effect. See Note 6 to Financial Statements for more information relating to the Bridge Loan and its repayment.\n\ufeff\nJanuary 2020 Term Loan Credit Agreement - On January 28, 2020, we executed a $450 million term loan credit agreement that matures on June 1, 2021 (January 2020 Term Loan Agreement). The January 2020 Term Loan Agreement provides that we can borrow the full amount in up to four borrowings by April 27, 2020. On January 29, 2020, we borrowed $163 million under the January 2020 Term Loan Agreement and on February 25, 2020, we submitted an irrevocable borrowing notice for a $55 million borrowing, to be made on February 28, 2020. The proceeds from each borrowing are to be used for general corporate purposes. Loans under the January 2020 Term Loan Agreement bear interest at per annum rates equal to, at our option, (i) LIBOR plus 0.50% until June 1, 2021, or (ii) an alternate base rate (the highest of (1) the prime rate of Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, the administrative agent under the agreement, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and (3) daily one-month LIBOR plus 1%).\n\ufeff\nThe January 2020 Term Loan Agreement contains customary covenants for facilities of this type, restricting, subject to certain exceptions, us and our subsidiaries from, among other things: incurring certain additional liens (not including liens relating to obligations secured pursuant to our Deed of Trust, which are permitted); entering into mergers and consolidations; sales of substantial assets and acquisitions and investments in subsidiaries. The January 2020 Term Loan Agreement also contains a senior debt-to-capitalization ratio covenant that effectively limits our ability to incur indebtedness in the future. See Credit Rating Provisions, Covenants and Cross Default Provisions\u201d below for additional information on this covenant and the calculation of this ratio.\n\ufeff\nRegulatory Capital Structure -We have committed to the PUCT to maintain a regulatory capital structure at or below the assumed debt-to-equity ratio established periodically by the PUCT for ratemaking purposes, which is 57.5% debt to 42.5% equity as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. Our current regulatory assumed debt-to-equity ratio went into effect on November 27, 2017 as part of the PUCT order issued in the rate review we filed in PUCT Docket No. 46957. Our regulatory capitalization ratio was 54.8% debt to 45.2% equity and 57.3% debt to 42.7% equity at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. See Note 9 to Financial Statements for discussion of the regulatory capitalization ratio and Note 3 to Financial Statements for a discussion of our 2017 rate review (PUCT Docket No. 46957). Our ability to incur additional long-term debt is limited by our regulatory capital structure, as we are able to issue future long-term debt only to the extent that we are in compliance therewith.\n\ufeff\nLiquidity Needs, Including Capital Expenditures - Our board of directors, which annually approves capital expenditure estimates for the following year, has approved capital expenditures totaling $2.5 billion in 2020. Management currently expects to recommend to our board of directors capital expenditures of $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion in each of the years 2021 through 2024, for a total of $11.9 billion for the five year period 2020 through 2024, based on the long-term plan presented to our board of directors. These capital expenditures are expected to be used for investment in transmission and distribution infrastructure, including expansion, maintenance and information technology. In connection with the PUCT approval of the Sempra Acquisition, we committed to making a minimum of $7.5 billion in capital expenditures over the period from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2022. As a result of our projected capital expenditures and our 2019 and 2018 capital expenditures of $2.1 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, we expect to exceed that minimum spend.\n\ufeff\nWe expect cash flows from operations combined with long-term debt issuances and term loan credit agreements as well as availability under the CP Program and Credit Facility to provide sufficient liquidity to fund current obligations, projected working capital requirements, maturities of long-term debt and capital spending for at least the next twelve months. Should additional liquidity or capital requirements arise, we may need additional access to capital markets, seek\nmember capital contributions or preserve equity through reductions or suspension of distributions to members. In addition, we may also consider additional new debt issuances, repurchases, exchange offers and other transactions in order to refinance or manage our long-term debt. The inability to raise capital on favorable terms or failure of counterparties to perform under credit or other financial agreements, particularly during any uncertainty in the financial markets, could impact our ability to sustain and grow the business and would likely increase capital costs that may not be recoverable through rates.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nCash Contributions - On February 18, 2020, we received cash capital contributions from our members totaling $87 million. During 2019, we received the following capital cash contributions from our members:\n\ufeff\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReceived\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNovember 21, 2019\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>340 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOctober 28, 2019\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>98 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nJuly 29, 2019\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>70 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMay 15, 2019\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,330 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nApril 30, 2019\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>70 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFebruary 19, 2019\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>70 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>1,978 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nCash Distributions - The PUCT order issued in the Sempra Acquisition and our Limited Liability Company Agreement set forth various restrictions on distributions to our members. Among those restrictions is the commitment that we will make no distributions that would cause us to be out of compliance with the PUCT's approved debt-to-equity ratio, which is currently 57.5% debt to 42.5% equity. The distribution restrictions also include the ability of our board, a majority of the Disinterested Directors, or either of the two member directors designated by Texas Transmission to limit distributions to the extent each determines it is necessary to meet expected future requirements of Oncor (including continuing compliance with the PUCT debt-to-equity ratio commitment). At December 31, 2019, we had $751 million available to distribute to our members as our regulatory capitalization ratio was 54.8% debt to 45.2% equity.\n\ufeff\nThe PUCT has the authority to determine what types of debt and equity are included in a utility's debt-to-equity ratio. For purposes of this ratio, debt is calculated as long-term debt including any finance leases plus unamortized gains on reacquired debt less unamortized issuance expenses, premiums and losses on reacquired debt. Equity is calculated as membership interests determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding the effects of acquisition accounting from a 2007 transaction.\n\ufeff\nOn February 19, 2020, our board of directors declared a cash distribution of $91 million, which was paid to our members on February 20, 2020.

Based on the funded status of the pension plans at December 31, 2019, our aggregate pension and Oncor OPEB plans funding is expected to total approximately $747 million in the five year period 2020 to 2024. In 2019, we made cash contributions to the pension and OPEB plans of $41 million and $35 million, respectively. See Note 10 to Financial Statements for additional information regarding pension and OPEB plans.\n\ufeff\nCapitalization - Our GAAP capitalization ratios were 42.6% and 40.8% long-term debt, less amounts due currently, to 57.4% and 59.2% membership interests at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. See Note 9 to Financial Statements for discussion of the regulatory capitalization ratio.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nCredit Rating Provisions, Covenants and Cross Default Provisions\n\ufeff\nImpact on Liquidity of Credit Ratings - The rating agencies assign credit ratings to certain of our debt securities. Our access to capital markets and cost of debt could be directly affected by our credit ratings. Any adverse action with respect to our credit ratings could generally cause borrowing costs to increase and the potential pool of investors and funding sources to decrease. In particular, a decline in credit ratings would increase the cost of our Credit Facility (as discussed below). In the event any adverse action with respect to our credit ratings takes place and causes borrowing costs to increase, we may not be able to recover such increased costs if they exceed our PUCT-approved cost of debt determined in our most recent rate review or subsequent rate reviews.\n\ufeff\nMost of our large suppliers and counterparties require an expected level of creditworthiness in order for them to enter into transactions with us. If our credit ratings decline, the costs to operate our business could increase because counterparties could require the posting of collateral in the form of cash-related instruments, or counterparties could decline to do business with us.\n\ufeff\nPresented below are the credit ratings assigned for our debt securities at February 27, 2020.\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nSenior Secured\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nCommercial Paper\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nS&P\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nA+\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nA-1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMoody's\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nA2\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPrime-2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFitch\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nA\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nAs described in Note 6 to Financial Statements, we established the CP Program in March 2018. The CP Program obtains liquidity support from our Credit Facility. As described in Note 7 to Financial Statements, our long-term debt (other than the $460 million unsecured term loan credit agreement we entered into in September 2019) is currently secured pursuant to the Deed of Trust by a first priority lien on certain of our transmission and distribution assets and is considered senior secured debt.\n\ufeff\nA rating reflects only the view of a rating agency, and is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Ratings can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change.\n\ufeff\nMaterial Credit Rating Covenants - The Credit Facility contains terms pursuant to which interest rates charged under the Credit Facility may be adjusted depending on credit ratings. Borrowings under the agreement bear interest at per annum rates equal to, at our option, (i) adjusted LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 0.875% to 1.50% depending on credit ratings assigned to our senior secured non-credit enhanced long-term debt or (ii) an alternate base rate (the highest of (1) the prime rate of JPMorgan Chase, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and (3) adjusted LIBOR plus 1.00%) plus a spread ranging from 0.00% to 0.50% depending on credit ratings assigned to our senior secured non-credit enhanced long-term debt. Based on the ratings assigned to our senior secured debt securities at February 27, 2020, our borrowings are generally LIBOR-based and will bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.00%. A decline in credit ratings would increase the cost of borrowing under the Credit Facility and likely increase the cost of our CP Program and any other debt issuances and additional credit facilities. The CP Program requires prompt notice to the dealer of any notice of intended or potential downgrade of our credit ratings.\nMaterial Financial Covenants - Our Credit Facility, our term loan credit agreements and the Note Purchase Agreements each contain a financial covenant that requires maintenance of a consolidated debt-to-capitalization ratio of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00. For purposes of this ratio, debt is calculated as indebtedness defined in the applicable agreement (principally, the sum of long-term debt, any capital leases (referred to as finance leases under current accounting literature), short-term debt and debt due currently in accordance with GAAP). Capitalization for our Credit Facility and term loan credit agreements is calculated as membership interests determined in accordance with GAAP plus debt described above. The ratio under our Note Purchase Agreements is calculated as total debt (all debt of the company and subsidiaries on a\nconsolidated basis) divided by the sum of total debt plus capitalization. Capitalization under the Note Purchase Agreements is calculated as membership interests plus liabilities for indebtedness maturing more than 12 months from the date of determination, with capitalization determined in accordance with GAAP and practices applicable to our type of business. At December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with this covenant and all other covenants under the Credit Facility, 2019 Term Loan Agreement and Note Purchase Agreements.\n\ufeff\nMaterial Cross Default Provisions - Certain financing arrangements contain provisions that may result in an event of default if there was a failure under other financing arrangements to meet payment terms or to observe other covenants that could result in an acceleration of payments due. Such provisions are referred to as cross default\u201d provisions.\n\ufeff\nUnder the Credit Facility, our term loan credit agreements and the Note Purchase Agreements, a default by us or any subsidiary in respect of indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of $100 million or any judgments for the payment of money in excess of $100 million that are not discharged within 60 days may cause the maturity of outstanding balances under those facilities to be accelerated.\n\ufeff\nUnder the Deed of Trust, an event of default under our indentures or, after all applicable notices have been given and all applicable grace periods have expired, under the Note Purchase Agreements, would permit the holders of our senior secured notes to exercise their remedies under the Deed of Trust.\n\ufeff\nLong-Term Contractual Obligations and Commitments - The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2019.

The resultant implied goodwill amount is compared to the recorded goodwill amount. Any excess of the recorded goodwill amount over the implied goodwill amount is written off as an impairment charge.\nOur expense amounts related to income taxes and related balance sheet amounts are recorded pursuant to our tax sharing agreement, as discussed above. Recording of such amounts involves significant management estimates and judgments, including judgments and estimates of the timing and probability of recognition of income and deductions by taxing authorities. In assessing the likelihood of realization of assets related to income taxes, management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income. Actual amounts related to income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, our forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods, as well as final review of filed tax returns by taxing authorities. Our and STH's income tax returns are regularly subject to examination by applicable tax authorities. In management's opinion, any liability recorded pursuant to income tax accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions reflects future amounts that may be owed as a result of any examination.\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td>

Borrowings under the agreement bear interest at per annum rates equal to, at our option, (i) adjusted LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 0.875% to 1.50% depending on credit ratings assigned to our senior secured non-credit enhanced long-term debt or (ii) an alternate base rate (the highest of (1) the prime rate of JPMorgan Chase, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and (3) adjusted LIBOR plus 1.00%) plus a spread ranging from 0.00% to 0.50% depending on credit ratings assigned to our senior secured non-credit enhanced long-term debt. Based on the ratings assigned to our senior secured debt securities at February 27, 2020, our borrowings are generally LIBOR-based and will bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.00%. A decline in credit ratings would increase the cost of borrowing under the Credit Facility and likely increase the cost of our CP Program and any other debt issuances and additional credit facilities. The CP Program requires prompt notice to the dealer of any notice of intended or potential downgrade of our credit ratings.\nCP Program - As discussed in Note 6 to Financial Statements, in March, 2018 we established the CP Program, under which we may issue unsecured CP Notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $2.0 billion.

For purposes of this ratio, debt is calculated as long-term debt including any finance leases plus unamortized gains on reacquired debt less unamortized issuance expenses, premiums and losses on reacquired debt. Equity is calculated as membership interests determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding the effects of acquisition accounting from a 2007 transaction.\nTechnology Risks\n\ufeff\nIn accordance with accounting rules, changes in benefit obligations associated with factors discussed above may be immediately recognized as a regulatory asset if related to recoverable service or in other comprehensive income and reclassified as a current cost in future years. As such, significant portions of benefit costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants.\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to Financial Statements. We prepare our financial statements in accordance with GAAP governing rate-regulated operations. Application of these accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reporting of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and revenues and expenses during the periods covered. The following is a summary of certain critical accounting policies that are impacted by judgments and uncertainties and under which different amounts might be reported using different assumptions or estimation methodologies.\n\ufeff\nThe InfraREIT Acquisition expanded Oncor's existing footprint in Texas by adding various electricity transmission and distribution assets and projects in the north, central, west and panhandle regions of Texas. Among those projects is an approximately $400 million joint project with Lubbock Power & Light (LP&L), with costs and investment to ultimately be split equally by Oncor and LP&L, which involves the build out of transmission lines and associated station work to join most of the City of Lubbock electric facilities to the ERCOT market. Oncor is responsible for construction of the project and invoices LP&L on a monthly basis for LP&L's portion of the costs. Oncor ultimately funded approximately $3 million and LP&L ultimately funded $3 million through reimbursement to Oncor of the project in 2019, with the remainder to be spent in 2020 and 2021. The project requires approval of four Certificates of Convenience and Necessity by the PUCT, three of which have received final approval (PUCT Docket Nos. 48625, 48668 and 48909) and one of which is pending (PUCT Docket No. 49151). This joint project consists of approximately 175 miles of transmission lines in Lubbock and surrounding areas.\nInfraREIT Acquisition - On May 16, 2019, we completed the InfraREIT Acquisition, pursuant to which we acquired all of the equity interests of InfraREIT and its subsidiary, InfraREIT Partners. The cash consideration paid to stockholders of InfraREIT and limited partners of InfraREIT Partners totaled $1,275 million. In addition, we paid certain transaction costs incurred by InfraREIT (including a management agreement termination fee of $40 million that InfraREIT paid an affiliate of Hunt Consolidated, Inc. at closing), with the aggregate cash consideration and payment of certain InfraREIT expenses totaling $1,324 million. In connection with and immediately after the closing of the InfraREIT Acquisition, on May 16, 2019, we also extinguished all $953 million aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt of\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nCash Flows - Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\n\ufeff\nSignificant Activities and Events\nCyber Security and Infrastructure Protection Risk\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nThe effective income tax rate was 15.9% and 17.7% for the 2019 and 2018 periods, respectively. The effective tax rate on pretax income differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the amortization of the regulatory liability for excess deferred taxes as a result of the TCJA, partially offset by the effects of the Texas margin tax.\nProvision in lieu of income taxes totaled $123 million (including a $15 million benefit related to nonoperating income) in 2019 compared to $117 million (including a $35 million benefit related to nonoperating income) in 2018.\n\ufeff\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nBUSINESS\n\ufeff\nWe offer certain pension, health care and life insurance benefits to eligible employees (and certain eligible former employees of EFH Corp. and Vistra whose service was partially assigned to Oncor in connection with the deregulation and disaggregation of EFH Corp.'s electric utility business in 2002) and their eligible dependents upon the retirement of such employees as we discuss in Note 10 to Financial Statements. We are authorized to establish a regulatory asset or liability for the difference between the amounts of pension and OPEB costs reflected in our PUCT-approved billing rates and the actual amounts that would otherwise have been recorded as charges or credits to earnings related to recoverable service. Accordingly, we recognize (principally as a regulatory asset or property) additional pension and OPEB costs consistent with PURA. Amounts deferred are ultimately subject to regulatory approval.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 should be read in conjunction with Selected Financial Data and our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements.\n \u00b7 capital expenditure commitments made as part of the Sempra Acquisition (see Note 8 to Financial Statements); and \nSee EECRF Filings Table below for a listing of EECRF filings impacting revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, as well as filings that will impact revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\ufeff\nAvailable Liquidity - Our primary source of liquidity, aside from operating cash flows, has been our ability to borrow under our Credit Facility, which also supports our CP Program. Because the CP Program is supported by the Credit Facility, CP Notes outstanding is a reduction to the available borrowing capacity. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $4 million and $3 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Considering CP Notes and letters of credit outstanding, available liquidity (cash and available Credit Facility borrowing capacity) at December 31, 2019 totaled $1,948 million, reflecting an increase of $767 million from December 31, 2018 primarily due to the issuance of new long-term debt and the repayment of CP Notes.\nRing-Fencing Measures\nCash used in investing activities totaled $3,378 million and $1,749 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The $1,629 million increase is primarily due to the $1,324 million purchase price paid for the InfraREIT Acquisition and a $330 million increase in capital expenditures for transmission and distribution facilities to serve new customers and infrastructure capital maintenance spending in the current period. The Other\u201d line includes proceeds of $18 million from the sale of certain distribution assets. For more details on the purchase price paid for the InfraREIT Acquisition, see Note 2 to Financial Statements.\nThe Texas Legislature meets every two years. During the 2019 legislative session, no legislation passed that is expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n\n\ufeff\nRates and Cost Recovery\nOn May 9, 2019, the PUCT issued a final order in Docket No. 48929 approving the transactions contemplated by the InfraREIT Acquisition, including the SDTS-SU Asset Exchange, and the Sempra-Sharyland Transaction. For more information on the InfraREIT Acquisition, see Note 2 to Financial Statements. In March 2018, the PUCT issued a final order in Docket No. 47675 regarding the Sempra Acquisition. For more information on the Sempra Acquisition, see Note 14 to Financial Statements.\nVarious ring-fencing measures have been taken to enhance our credit quality and the separateness between the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities, Sempra and its affiliates (other than the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities), and any other entities with a direct or indirect ownership interest in Oncor or Oncor Holdings. These measures serve to mitigate the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities' credit exposure to Sempra and its affiliates and any other direct or indirect owners of Oncor and Oncor Holdings, and to reduce the risk that the assets and liabilities of Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities would be substantively consolidated with the assets and liabilities of any Sempra entity or any other direct or indirect owners of Oncor and Oncor Holdings in connection with a bankruptcy of any such entities. Such measures include, among other things: the 19.75% equity interest held by Texas Transmission; maintenance of separate books and records for the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities; and our board of directors being comprised of a majority of directors who meet certain disinterested director standards. As a result, none of the assets of the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities are available to satisfy the debt or obligations of any Sempra entity or any other direct or indirect owner of Oncor or Oncor Holdings. The assets and liabilities of the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities are separate and distinct from those of any Sempra entities and any other direct or indirect owner of Oncor or Oncor Holdings. We do not bear any liability for debt or contractual obligations of Sempra and its affiliates or any other direct or indirect owner of Oncor or Oncor Holdings, and vice versa. Accordingly, our operations are conducted, and our cash flows are managed, independently from Sempra and its affiliates and any other direct or indirect owner of Oncor or Oncor Holdings. For more information on the ring-fencing measures, see Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties - Ring-Fencing Measures.\u201d\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nWe also evaluate goodwill for impairment annually on October 1 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. The determination of the existence of these and other indications of impairment involves judgments that are subjective in nature and may require the use of estimates in forecasting future results and cash flows.\nTaxes other than income taxes increased $12 million, or 2%, to $508 million in 2019. The increase is primarily due to $28 million higher property taxes in the current period including $16 million related to the InfraREIT Acquisition and $4 million higher local franchise fees, partially offset by $20 million expense in the prior period related to recovery of certain municipal franchise fees as part of the 2017 rate review.\n\ufeff\nThe January 2020 Term Loan Agreement contains customary covenants for facilities of this type, restricting, subject to certain exceptions, us and our subsidiaries from, among other things: incurring certain additional liens (not including liens relating to obligations secured pursuant to our Deed of Trust, which are permitted); entering into mergers and consolidations; sales of substantial assets and acquisitions and investments in subsidiaries. The January 2020 Term Loan Agreement also contains a senior debt-to-capitalization ratio covenant that effectively limits our ability to incur indebtedness in the future. See Credit Rating Provisions, Covenants and Cross Default Provisions\u201d below for additional information on this covenant and the calculation of this ratio.\nPresented below are the credit ratings assigned for our debt securities at February 27, 2020.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nDebt-Related Activity - In May 2019, we issued (i) $351 million of senior secured notes under the Note Purchase Agreements in exchange for a like principal amount of notes issued by InfraREIT subsidiaries, (ii) $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.75% senior secured notes due 2024 (2024 Notes), (iii) $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.70% senior secured notes due 2028 (2028 Notes) and (iv) $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.80% senior secured notes due 2049 (3.80% 2049 Notes). In September 2019, we (i) issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of 3.10% senior secured notes due 2049 (3.10% 2049 Notes) and (ii) entered in to and borrowed $460 million under a term loan credit agreement that matures on October 6, 2020. Repayments of long-term debt consisted of $488 million aggregate principal amount of certain InfraREIT-related long-term debt in connection with and immediately following the closing of the InfraREIT Acquisition, $250 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes, $350 million aggregate principal amount under a previous term loan credit agreement and $6 million principal amount of the quarterly amortizing debt for our notes issued under the Note Purchase Agreements. See Note 7 to Financial Statements for additional information regarding long-term debt.\nof substantial assets and acquisitions and investments in subsidiaries. The 2019 Term Loan Agreement also contains a senior debt-to-capitalization ratio covenant that effectively limits our ability to incur indebtedness in the future. At December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with this covenant and all other covenants in the 2019 Term Loan Agreement. See Credit Rating Provisions, Covenants and Cross Default Provisions\u201d below for additional information on this covenant and the calculation of this ratio. While it was in effect, the 2018 Term Loan Agreement contained similar covenants to the 2019 Term Loan Agreement.\nUnder the Deed of Trust, an event of default under our indentures or, after all applicable notices have been given and all applicable grace periods have expired, under the Note Purchase Agreements, would permit the holders of our senior secured notes to exercise their remedies under the Deed of Trust.\nDepreciation and amortization expense reported in the statements of consolidated cash flows was $83 million and $106 million more than the amounts reported in the statements of consolidated income for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The differences result from certain regulatory asset amortization reported in operation and maintenance expense and taxes other than income taxes.\n\ufeff\nInterest expense and related charges were $375 million and $351 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively. The $24 million increase is primarily driven by a $61 million increase due to higher average borrowings including $27 million related to the InfraREIT Acquisition, partially offset by a $36 million decrease attributable to lower average interest rates.\nWe entered into a $350 million aggregate principal amount term loan credit agreement in December 2018 (2018 Term Loan Agreement) that was repaid in full in November 2019.\nAll dollar amounts in the tables in the following discussion and analysis are stated in millions of U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated.\nFinancial Results \u2500 Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nCash Distributions - The PUCT order issued in the Sempra Acquisition and our Limited Liability Company Agreement set forth various restrictions on distributions to our members. Among those restrictions is the commitment that we will make no distributions that would cause us to be out of compliance with the PUCT's approved debt-to-equity ratio, which is currently 57.5% debt to 42.5% equity. The distribution restrictions also include the ability of our board, a majority of the Disinterested Directors, or either of the two member directors designated by Texas Transmission to limit distributions to the extent each determines it is necessary to meet expected future requirements of Oncor (including continuing compliance with the PUCT debt-to-equity ratio commitment). At December 31, 2019, we had $751 million available to distribute to our members as our regulatory capitalization ratio was 54.8% debt to 45.2% equity.\n(b) Excludes impacts of the Sharyland 2017Asset Exchange.\n\ufeff\nWholesale transmission service expense increased $43 million, or 4%, to $1,005 million in 2019 primarily due to higher fees paid to other transmission entities.\nmember capital contributions or preserve equity through reductions or suspension of distributions to members. In addition, we may also consider additional new debt issuances, repurchases, exchange offers and other transactions in order to refinance or manage our long-term debt. The inability to raise capital on favorable terms or failure of counterparties to perform under credit or other financial agreements, particularly during any uncertainty in the financial markets, could impact our ability to sustain and grow the business and would likely increase capital costs that may not be recoverable through rates.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nBenefit costs are impacted by actual and actuarial estimates of employee demographics (including but not limited to age, compensation levels and years of accredited service), future health care costs, the level of contributions made to retiree plans, expected and actual earnings on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation. Actuarial assumptions are reviewed and updated annually based on current economic conditions and trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future benefit costs. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased or decreased benefit costs in future periods.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nUnder the Credit Facility, our term loan credit agreements and the Note Purchase Agreements, a default by us or any subsidiary in respect of indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of $100 million or any judgments for the payment of money in excess of $100 million that are not discharged within 60 days may cause the maturity of outstanding balances under those facilities to be accelerated.\n o $21 million decrease due to lower consumption driven primarily by weather. \nAmounts payable to and receivable from members related to income taxes on our balance sheet reflect our tax provision net of quarterly estimated tax payments required by the tax sharing agreement that are trued up the following year when the annual tax return is filed.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nOn February 19, 2020, our board of directors declared a cash distribution of $91 million, which was paid to our members on February 20, 2020.

Risks to our key technology platforms include nonperformance by equipment and service providers, failure of the technology to meet performance expectations and inadequate cost recovery allowances by regulatory authorities. We continue to implement measures to mitigate these risks, including business continuity and disaster recovery plans, but there can be no assurance that these measures will achieve the operational and financial objectives.\nSee Note 8 to Financial Statements for details of commitments and contingencies.\n\ufeff\nFor information on other regulatory proceedings, see Note 3 to Financial Statements.\nJanuary 2020 Term Loan Credit Agreement - On January 28, 2020, we executed a $450 million term loan credit agreement that matures on June 1, 2021 (January 2020 Term Loan Agreement). The January 2020 Term Loan Agreement provides that we can borrow the full amount in up to four borrowings by April 27, 2020. On January 29, 2020, we borrowed $163 million under the January 2020 Term Loan Agreement and on February 25, 2020, we submitted an irrevocable borrowing notice for a $55 million borrowing, to be made on February 28, 2020. The proceeds from each borrowing are to be used for general corporate purposes. Loans under the January 2020 Term Loan Agreement bear interest at per annum rates equal to, at our option, (i) LIBOR plus 0.50% until June 1, 2021, or (ii) an alternate base rate (the highest of (1) the prime rate of Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, the administrative agent under the agreement, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and (3) daily one-month LIBOR plus 1%).\n (a) See Note 7 to Financial Statements for more information regarding our long-term debt. \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n o $12 million increase due to NTU wholesale distribution substation service revenue following the closing of the InfraREIT Acquisition. \nOur tax sharing agreement with Oncor Holdings, STH (as successor to EFH Corp.) and Texas Transmission provides for the calculation of amounts related to income taxes for each of Oncor Holdings and Oncor substantially as if these entities were taxed as corporations and requires payments to the members determined on that basis (without duplication for any income taxes paid by a subsidiary of Oncor Holdings).\nOperating Data\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nAccounting for the Effects of Income Taxes\nPension and OPEB Plans Funding - Our funding for the pension and Oncor OPEB plans for the calendar year 2020 is expected to total $177 million and $35 million, respectively. Based on the funded status of the pension plans at December 31, 2019, our aggregate pension and Oncor OPEB plans funding is expected to total approximately $747 million in the five year period 2020 to 2024. In 2019, we made cash contributions to the pension and OPEB plans of $41 million and $35 million, respectively.

If our credit ratings decline, the costs to operate our business could increase because counterparties could require the posting of collateral in the form of cash-related instruments, or counterparties could decline to do business with us.\nLong-Term Debt Activity in 2019\n related to rate case expenses and recovery of certain municipal franchise fees as part of the 2017 rate review, offset by a $4 million increase in energy efficiency program costs. \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nAs described in Note 6 to Financial Statements, we established the CP Program in March 2018. The CP Program obtains liquidity support from our Credit Facility. As described in Note 7 to Financial Statements, our long-term debt (other than the $460 million unsecured term loan credit agreement we entered into in September 2019) is currently secured pursuant to the Deed of Trust by a first priority lien on certain of our transmission and distribution assets and is considered senior secured debt.\n\n\ufeff\nOur consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, include the results of our wholly owned, indirect subsidiary, NTU, which is a regulated utility that provides electricity transmission delivery service in the north-central, western and panhandle regions of Texas. We acquired NTU as part of the InfraREIT Acquisition that closed on May 16, 2019.\n\ufeff\nLong-Term Debt Repayments - Repayments of long-term debt during 2019 consisted of repayment of $488 million aggregate principal amount of certain InfraREIT-related long-term debt on May 16, 2019, in connection with and immediately following the closing of the InfraREIT Acquisition, $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.15% senior secured notes due June 1, 2019, $350 million aggregate principal amount under the 2018 Term Loan Agreement, and $6 million principal amount of the quarterly amortizing debt for our 2020 Notes, 2029 Notes and 2030 Notes.\n\ufeff\n o $26 million increase due to growth in points of delivery, \nMaterial Cross Default Provisions - Certain financing arrangements contain provisions that may result in an event of default if there was a failure under other financing arrangements to meet payment terms or to observe other covenants that could result in an acceleration of payments due. Such provisions are referred to as cross default\u201d provisions.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 An Increase in TCRF - third-party wholesale transmission service (TCRF Third-Party) - TCRF revenues increased $43 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. TCRF is a reconcilable distribution rate charged to REPs to recover fees we pay to third-party transmission service providers under their TCOS rates and the retail portion of our own TCOS rate described above. Changes in our TCRF Third-Party revenue are to pass through an increase in third-party wholesale transmission service expense. At December 31, 2019, $30 million was deferred as over-recovered wholesale transmission service expense (see Note 3 to Financial Statements). PUCT rules require us to update the TCRF component of our retail delivery rates on March 1 and September 1 each year. \n\n\ufeff\nMatters with the PUCT - See discussion below under Regulation and Rates - Matters with the PUCT\u201d.\n\ufeff\n (b) This docket includes a $12 million annual revenue reduction for excess deferred taxes related to the Docket No. 48325 (TCJA) line below. \nAvailable Liquidity/CP Program/Credit Facility/Short-Term Borrowings\n \u00b7 employment contracts with management; \nSee TCOS Filings Table below for a listing of transmission interim rate update applications and anticipated impacts on revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, as well as filings and the anticipated impact to revenues for the year ending December 31, 2020.\nRegulatory Capital Structure -We have committed to the PUCT to maintain a regulatory capital structure at or below the assumed debt-to-equity ratio established periodically by the PUCT for ratemaking purposes, which is 57.5% debt to 42.5% equity as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. Our current regulatory assumed debt-to-equity ratio went into effect on November 27, 2017 as part of the PUCT order issued in the rate review we filed in PUCT Docket No. 46957. Our regulatory capitalization ratio was 54.8% debt to 45.2% equity and 57.3% debt to 42.7% equity at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. See Note 9 to Financial Statements for discussion of the regulatory capitalization ratio and Note 3 to Financial Statements for a discussion of our 2017 rate review (PUCT Docket No. 46957). Our ability to incur additional long-term debt is limited by our regulatory capital structure, as we are able to issue future long-term debt only to the extent that we are in compliance therewith.\nSee Notes 1 and 5 to Financial Statements for additional information.\n\nOther deductions and (income) - net was $21 million favorable in 2019 compared to 2018. The variance is primarily due to allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) equity income recorded in the current period and Sempra Acquisition related costs reflected in the prior period. See Note 13 to Financial Statements for more information.\n o $142 million increase due to the InfraREIT Acquisition, and \nLiquidity Needs, Including Capital Expenditures - Our board of directors, which annually approves capital expenditure estimates for the following year, has approved capital expenditures totaling $2.5 billion in 2020. Management currently expects to recommend to our board of directors capital expenditures of $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion in each of the years 2021 through 2024, for a total of $11.9 billion for the five year period 2020 through 2024, based on the long-term plan presented to our board of directors. These capital expenditures are expected to be used for investment in transmission and distribution infrastructure, including expansion, maintenance and information technology. In connection with the PUCT approval of the Sempra Acquisition, we committed to making a minimum of $7.5 billion in capital expenditures over the period from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2022. As a result of our projected capital expenditures and our 2019 and 2018 capital expenditures of $2.1 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, we expect to exceed that minimum spend.\n____________\nIn each of 2019, 2018 and 2017, we concluded, based on a qualitative assessment, that our estimated enterprise fair value was more likely than not greater than our carrying value. As a result, no additional testing for impairment was required and no impairments were recognized.\nState Legislation\nWe evaluate long-lived assets (including intangible assets with finite lives) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\nUnder the terms of the Credit Facility, the commitments of the lenders to make loans to us are several and not joint. Accordingly, if any lender fails to make loans to us, our available liquidity could be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender's commitments under the facility. See Note 6 to Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Credit Facility.\nREGULATION AND RATES\n\n\ufeff\nItem 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nDepreciation and amortization increased $52 million to $723 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to ongoing investments in property, plant and equipment and $29 million from property, plant and equipment acquired in the InfraREIT Acquisition.\nWe are a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, while partnerships are not subject to income taxes, in consideration of the presentation of our financial statements as an entity subject to cost-based regulatory rate-setting processes with such costs historically including income taxes and the tax sharing agreement, the financial statements present amounts determined under the tax sharing agreement as provision in lieu of income taxes\u201d and liability in lieu of deferred income taxes\u201d. Such amounts are determined in accordance with the provisions of the accounting guidance for income taxes and accounting standards that provide interpretive guidance for accounting for uncertain tax positions and thus differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities are accounted for as if we were a stand-alone corporation. In the event such amounts are not paid under the tax sharing agreement, it is probable that this regulatory liability will continue to be included in Oncor's rate setting processes.\n\ufeff\nRevenues that contribute to earnings increased $224 million during 2019. The change reflected the following components:\n\ufeff\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nOperation and maintenance expense increased $24 million, or 3%, to $899 million in 2019. The increase includes $9 million higher labor and contractor related costs, $8 million in higher materials and transportation costs and $4 million higher energy efficiency program costs.\n\ufeff\nCash provided by operating activities totaled $1,275 million and $1,482 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The $207 million decrease is primarily the result of a $162 million increase in storm costs, a $66 million decrease in transmission and distribution receipts, a $27 million increase in materials and supply purchases, and a $23 million increase in interest payments. The decreases were partially offset by $47 million of lower employee benefit plan funding and $15 million of higher stock-based compensation related payments in the prior period.\nWe are subject to rate regulation and our financial statements reflect regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with GAAP related to the effect of certain types of regulation. Regulatory assets and liabilities represent probable future revenues that will be recovered from or refunded to customers through the ratemaking process based on PURA and/or the PUCT's orders, precedents or substantive rules. Rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital subject to PUCT review for reasonableness and prudence and possible disallowance. Regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate earned on invested capital and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. See Note 3 to Financial Statements for more information regarding regulatory assets and liabilities.\nCapitalization - Our GAAP capitalization ratios were 42.6% and 40.8% long-term debt, less amounts due currently, to 57.4% and 59.2% membership interests at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. See Note 9 to Financial Statements for discussion of the regulatory capitalization ratio.\n__________\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nOur rates are regulated by the PUCT and certain cities and are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and annual earnings oversight. This regulatory treatment does not provide any assurance as to achievement of earnings levels. Our rates are regulated based on an analysis of our costs and capital structure, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding. Rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. However, there is no assurance that the PUCT will judge all of our costs to have been prudently incurred, that the PUCT will not reduce the amount of invested capital included in the capital structure that our rates are based upon, that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will always result in rates that produce full recovery of our costs or that our authorized return on equity will not be reduced. See Regulation and Rates\u201d below for further information.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nA breach of our cyber/data or physical security measures that impairs our information technology infrastructure or transmission and distribution infrastructure could disrupt normal business operations, affect our ability to control our transmission and distribution system, expose us to material regulatory claims and limit communication with third parties. Any loss of confidential or proprietary data through a cyber/data breach, including a breach involving one of our third-party vendors, could also materially affect our reputation, expose the company to legal claims and fines or impair our ability to execute on business strategies. If third parties in our supply chain experience cyber attacks, the services they provide us could be disrupted. This disruption could interfere with our ability to perform our obligations to others, which could negatively affect our financial condition and reputation. In addition, the theft, damage, or improper disclosure of sensitive data held by these third parties may subject us to further harm. We participate in industry groups and with regulators to remain current on emerging threats and mitigating techniques. While we have not experienced any security breach with a significant operational, reputational or financial impact, we recognize the growing threat within our industry and are proactively taking steps to continuously improve our technology, security measures, processes and services to detect, mitigate and protect our assets, both physical and cyber.\nCapital Availability and Cost\n\ufeff\nSenior Secured Notes Issuances - In May 2019, we issued (i) $351 million of senior secured notes under the Note Purchase Agreements in exchange for a like principal amount of notes issued by InfraREIT subsidiaries, (ii) $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2024 Notes, (iii) $300 million aggregate principal amount of 2028 Notes and (iv) $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.80% 2049 Notes. In September 2019, we issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of 3.10% 2049 Notes (3.10% 2049 Notes and, together with the 2024 Notes, 2028 Notes and the 3.80% 2049 Notes, the New Indenture Notes).\nNet income was $106 million higher than the prior period, primarily driven by an increase in revenues that contribute to earnings, the impacts of the InfraREIT Acquisition and favorable other income including AFUDC equity, partially offset by increases in operation and maintenance expense, property taxes, depreciation and amortization and a TCJA related write-off in the prior period.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n o $18 million increase due to the effects of the DCRF rate increases effective September 1, 2019, and \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nconsolidated basis) divided by the sum of total debt plus capitalization. Capitalization under the Note Purchase Agreements is calculated as membership interests plus liabilities for indebtedness maturing more than 12 months from the date of determination, with capitalization determined in accordance with GAAP and practices applicable to our type of business. At December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with this covenant and all other covenants under the Credit Facility, 2019 Term Loan Agreement and Note Purchase Agreements.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 An Increase in Transmission Base Revenues - Transmission base revenues (or TCOS revenues) increased $214 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. TCOS revenues are collected from load serving entities benefitting from our transmission system. REPs serving customers in our service territory are billed through the TCRF mechanism discussed below, while other load serving entities are billed directly. In order to reflect changes in our invested transmission capital, PUCT rules allow us to update our TCOS rates by filing up to two interim TCOS rate adjustments in a calendar year. The increase in TCOS revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 reflects a: \nCredit Facility - At December 31, 2019, we had a $2.0 billion unsecured Credit Facility to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, issuance of letters of credit and to support our CP Program with a five-year term expiring in November 2022. We have the option of requesting up to two one-year extensions and an option to request an increase in our borrowing capacity of $400 million, in increments of not less than $100 million, provided certain conditions are met, including lender approvals. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are classified as short-term on our balance sheets. At December 31, 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility.\n\ufeff\nIn May 2019, we entered into the short-term Bridge Loan, borrowing an aggregate principal amount of $600 million, which was subsequently repaid on May 23, 2019. In connection with the closing of the InfraREIT Acquisition, on May 16, 2019, the short-term credit facilities of InfraREIT and its subsidiaries were terminated and borrowings totaling $114 million aggregate principal amount were repaid in full by Oncor. See Note 6 to Financial Statements for additional information regarding short-term debt and Note 2 to Financial Statements regarding the InfraREIT Acquisition.\n________________\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nOur 2018 Form 10-K includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 in Item 7 of Part II, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTotal operating revenues increased $246 million, or 6%, to $4.347 billion in 2019. Revenue is billed under tariffs approved by the PUCT.\nThe following are not included in the table above:\nCredit Rating Provisions, Covenants and Cross Default Provisions\nMay 2019 Short-Term Bridge Loan - On May 9, 2019, we entered into the Bridge Loan, a short-term, unsecured term loan credit agreement in an aggregate principal amount of up to $600 million in connection with the InfraREIT Acquisition. The Bridge Loan had a six-month term, maturing on November 9, 2019. We borrowed $600 million under the Bridge Loan on May 15, 2019 and used the proceeds to repay certain debt of InfraREIT subsidiaries. We repaid all outstanding amounts under the Bridge Loan in full on May 23, 2019, and as a result the Bridge Loan is no longer in effect. See Note 6 to Financial Statements for more information relating to the Bridge Loan and its repayment.\nThe CP Program obtains liquidity support from our Credit Facility discussed below. We may utilize either the CP Program or the Credit Facility at our option for funding. See Note 6 to Financial Statements for additional information regarding the CP Program.\n\ufeff\nFollowing is a discussion of key risks and challenges facing management and the initiatives currently underway to manage such challenges. For additional information concerning risk factors related to our business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in this report.\nSee TCRF Filings Table below for a listing of TCRF filings impacting cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, as well as filings and the anticipated impacts to cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nSummary\n\ufeff\nBecause the CP Program is supported by the Credit Facility, CP Notes outstanding reduce the available borrowing capacity. Considering the CP Notes outstanding and the limitations described below, available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility totaled $1,944 million and $1,178 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nSee the DCRF Filings Table below for a listing of annual filings impacting revenues for 2019 and 2018.\n \u00b7 A Net Decrease in EECRF and Other Regulatory Surcharges - EECRF and other regulatory surcharge revenues decreased by $21 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The EECRF is a reconcilable rate designed to recover current energy efficiency program costs and performance bonuses earned by exceeding PUCT targets in prior years and to refund or recover any over/under recovery of our costs in prior years. We recognize the performance bonuses in other miscellaneous revenues upon approval by the PUCT. PUCT rules require us to file an annual EECRF tariff update by the first business day in June of each year for implementation on March 1 of the next calendar year. The net decrease includes a $25 million reduction due to cessation of certain surcharges \n\ufeff\nMaterial Financial Covenants - Our Credit Facility, our term loan credit agreements and the Note Purchase Agreements each contain a financial covenant that requires maintenance of a consolidated debt-to-capitalization ratio of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00. For purposes of this ratio, debt is calculated as indebtedness defined in the applicable agreement (principally, the sum of long-term debt, any capital leases (referred to as finance leases under current accounting literature), short-term debt and debt due currently in accordance with GAAP). Capitalization for our Credit Facility and term loan credit agreements is calculated as membership interests determined in accordance with GAAP plus debt described above. The ratio under our Note Purchase Agreements is calculated as total debt (all debt of the company and subsidiaries on a\n\ufeff\nThe 2019 Term Loan Agreement contains customary covenants for facilities of this type, restricting, subject to certain exceptions, us and our subsidiaries from, among other things: incurring certain additional liens (not including liens relating to obligations secured pursuant to our Deed of Trust, which are permitted); entering into mergers and consolidations; sales\nRevenues collected for pass-through expenses include the following components.

The $4 million increase in distribution base rate revenues primarily reflects: \n(a) Monthly charges are for a residential customer using an assumed 1,200 kWh.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTCRF Filings Table\n o Partially offset by a $11 million decrease due to the refund of excess deferred federal income taxes resulting from the TCJA, and \n\ufeff\nUse of Proceeds - We used the proceeds (net of the initial purchasers' discount, fees, expenses and accrued interest) of $2,446 million from the sale of the New Indenture Notes and borrowings on the 2019 Term Loan Agreement for general corporate purposes, including to repay all amounts outstanding under the Bridge Loan, to repay our $250 million aggregate principal amount of 2.15% Senior Secured Notes due June 1, 2019 and to repay CP Notes, when due, under our CP Program. For more information on the Bridge Loan, see Note 6 to Financial Statements. See Note 7 to Financial Statements for additional information regarding repayments, redemptions and issuances of long-term debt.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nWe are a regulated electricity transmission and distribution company principally engaged in providing delivery services to REPs that sell power in the north-central, eastern, western and panhandle regions of Texas. We are a majority-owned subsidiary of Oncor Holdings, which is indirectly and wholly owned by Sempra. Oncor Holdings owns 80.25% of our outstanding membership interests and Texas Transmission owns 19.75% of our outstanding membership interests. We are managed as an integrated business; consequently, there is only one reportable segment.\nSee Note 10 to Financial Statements regarding other disclosures related to pension and OPEB plans obligations.\nWe cannot predict future regulatory or legislative actions or any changes in economic and securities market conditions. Such actions or changes could significantly alter our basic financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe expect cash flows from operations combined with long-term debt issuances and term loan credit agreements as well as availability under the CP Program and Credit Facility to provide sufficient liquidity to fund current obligations, projected working capital requirements, maturities of long-term debt and capital spending for at least the next twelve months. Should additional liquidity or capital requirements arise, we may need additional access to capital markets, seek\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nwe were in compliance with all covenants in the Credit Facility.

Any adverse action with respect to our credit ratings could generally cause borrowing costs to increase and the potential pool of investors and funding sources to decrease. Our credit ratings are currently higher than those of Sempra. If credit rating agencies were to change their views of our independence from Sempra and its affiliates (other than the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities), our credit ratings could decline. We believe this risk is substantially mitigated by the ring-fencing measures as described in Notes 1 and 2 to Financial Statements. See Risk Factors-Adverse actions with respect to our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital\u201d, and In the future, we could have liquidity needs that could be difficult to satisfy under some circumstances, especially in uncertain financial market conditions.\u201d\n\ufeff\nKEY RISKS AND CHALLENGES\nThe Credit Facility contains customary covenants for facilities of this type, restricting, subject to certain exceptions, us and our subsidiaries from, among other things: incurring certain additional liens (not including liens relating to obligations secured pursuant to our Deed of Trust, which are permitted); entering into mergers and consolidations; sales of substantial assets and acquisitions and investments in subsidiaries. The Credit Facility also contains a senior debt-to-capitalization ratio covenant that effectively limits our ability to incur indebtedness in the future.

Ratings can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change.\nLong-Term Unsecured Term Loan Credit Agreements - In September 2019, we executed a $460 million term loan credit agreement that matures on October 6, 2020 (2019 Term Loan Agreement). At December 31, 2019, we had outstanding borrowings of $460 million under the 2019 Term Loan Agreement bearing interest at a per annum rate equal to, at Oncor's option, (i) LIBOR plus 0.50%, or (ii) an alternate base rate (the highest of (1) the prime rate of Wells Fargo Bank National Association, the administrative agent under the agreement, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and (3) daily one-month LIBOR plus 1%). At December 31, 2019, we had outstanding borrowings of $460 million under the 2019 Term Loan Agreement bearing interest at the rate per annum of 2.28%.

The $1,855 million net increase includes debt restructuring activity in connection with the InfraREIT Acquisition that included new debt issuances and the receipt of capital contributions, partially offset by the extinguishment of certain debt of InfraREIT and its subsidiaries. The current period activity also includes an increase due to $1,160 million of new debt issuances, the repayment of all short-term debt and the repayment of Oncor senior secured notes that matured during the period. For more details, see Notes 6 and 7 to Financial Statements for additional information regarding short-term borrowings and long-term debt activity, respectively, and Note 9 to Financial Statements for additional information regarding capital contributions from our members.\nImpact on Liquidity of Credit Ratings - The rating agencies assign credit ratings to certain of our debt securities. Our access to capital markets and cost of debt could be directly affected by our credit ratings. Any adverse action with respect to our credit ratings could generally cause borrowing costs to increase and the potential pool of investors and funding sources to decrease. In particular, a decline in credit ratings would increase the cost of our Credit Facility (as discussed below). In the event any adverse action with respect to our credit ratings takes place and causes borrowing costs to increase, we may not be able to recover such increased costs if they exceed our PUCT-approved cost of debt determined in our most recent rate review or subsequent rate reviews.\nIf at the assessment date our carrying value exceeds our estimated fair value (enterprise value), then the estimated enterprise value is compared to the estimated fair values of our operating assets (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities at the assessment date. The resultant implied goodwill amount is compared to the recorded goodwill amount. Any excess of the recorded goodwill amount over the implied goodwill amount is written off as an impairment charge.\nOur expense amounts related to income taxes and related balance sheet amounts are recorded pursuant to our tax sharing agreement, as discussed above. Recording of such amounts involves significant management estimates and judgments, including judgments and estimates of the timing and probability of recognition of income and deductions by taxing authorities. In assessing the likelihood of realization of assets related to income taxes, management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income. Actual amounts related to income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, our forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods, as well as final review of filed tax returns by taxing authorities. Our and STH's income tax returns are regularly subject to examination by applicable tax authorities. In management's opinion, any liability recorded pursuant to income tax accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions reflects future amounts that may be owed as a result of any examination.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nLong-Term Contractual Obligations and Commitments - The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2019. See Notes 7 and 8 to Financial Statements for additional disclosures regarding long-term debt and operating lease obligations.\nDCRF Filings Table\n______________\nMaterial Credit Rating Covenants - The Credit Facility contains terms pursuant to which interest rates charged under the Credit Facility may be adjusted depending on credit ratings. Borrowings under the agreement bear interest at per annum rates equal to, at our option, (i) adjusted LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 0.875% to 1.50% depending on credit ratings assigned to our senior secured non-credit enhanced long-term debt or (ii) an alternate base rate (the highest of (1) the prime rate of JPMorgan Chase, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and (3) adjusted LIBOR plus 1.00%) plus a spread ranging from 0.00% to 0.50% depending on credit ratings assigned to our senior secured non-credit enhanced long-term debt. Based on the ratings assigned to our senior secured debt securities at February 27, 2020, our borrowings are generally LIBOR-based and will bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.00%. A decline in credit ratings would increase the cost of borrowing under the Credit Facility and likely increase the cost of our CP Program and any other debt issuances and additional credit facilities. The CP Program requires prompt notice to the dealer of any notice of intended or potential downgrade of our credit ratings.\nCP Program - As discussed in Note 6 to Financial Statements, in March, 2018 we established the CP Program, under which we may issue unsecured CP Notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $2.0 billion. A national bank acts as the issuing and paying agent under the CP Program pursuant to the terms of an issuing and paying agent agreement. Under the CP Program, we issue CP Notes from time to time, and the proceeds of the CP Notes are used for short-term financing of our business operations. At December 31, 2019, we had $46 million of CP Notes outstanding under the CP Program.\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nEECRF Filings Table\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\n(c)Prior to November 27, 2017, the AMS surcharge was separately reconcilable and included as a line item with other miscellaneous revenues. On November 27, 2017, AMS-related expenses and returns became recoverable through distribution base revenues.\n \u00b7 An Increase in Other Miscellaneous Revenues - Other miscellaneous revenues increased $6 million primarily due to a $2 million higher energy efficiency program bonus and $3 million higher other service revenue including facility studies and mutual assistance. \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nSee Note 1 to Financial Statements for discussion of changes in accounting standards.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nCash Contributions - On February 18, 2020, we received cash capital contributions from our members totaling $87 million. During 2019, we received the following capital cash contributions from our members:\nThe PUCT has the authority to determine what types of debt and equity are included in a utility's debt-to-equity ratio. For purposes of this ratio, debt is calculated as long-term debt including any finance leases plus unamortized gains on reacquired debt less unamortized issuance expenses, premiums and losses on reacquired debt. Equity is calculated as membership interests determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding the effects of acquisition accounting from a 2007 transaction.\nTechnology Risks\n\ufeff\nIn accordance with accounting rules, changes in benefit obligations associated with factors discussed above may be immediately recognized as a regulatory asset if related to recoverable service or in other comprehensive income and reclassified as a current cost in future years. As such, significant portions of benefit costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants.\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to Financial Statements. We prepare our financial statements in accordance with GAAP governing rate-regulated operations. Application of these accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reporting of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and revenues and expenses during the periods covered. The following is a summary of certain critical accounting policies that are impacted by judgments and uncertainties and under which different amounts might be reported using different assumptions or estimation methodologies.\n\ufeff\nThe InfraREIT Acquisition expanded Oncor's existing footprint in Texas by adding various electricity transmission and distribution assets and projects in the north, central, west and panhandle regions of Texas. Among those projects is an approximately $400 million joint project with Lubbock Power & Light (LP&L), with costs and investment to ultimately be split equally by Oncor and LP&L, which involves the build out of transmission lines and associated station work to join most of the City of Lubbock electric facilities to the ERCOT market. Oncor is responsible for construction of the project and invoices LP&L on a monthly basis for LP&L's portion of the costs. Oncor ultimately funded approximately $3 million and LP&L ultimately funded $3 million through reimbursement to Oncor of the project in 2019, with the remainder to be spent in 2020 and 2021. The project requires approval of four Certificates of Convenience and Necessity by the PUCT, three of which have received final approval (PUCT Docket Nos. 48625, 48668 and 48909) and one of which is pending (PUCT Docket No. 49151). This joint project consists of approximately 175 miles of transmission lines in Lubbock and surrounding areas.\nInfraREIT Acquisition - On May 16, 2019, we completed the InfraREIT Acquisition, pursuant to which we acquired all of the equity interests of InfraREIT and its subsidiary, InfraREIT Partners. The cash consideration paid to stockholders of InfraREIT and limited partners of InfraREIT Partners totaled $1,275 million. In addition, we paid certain transaction costs incurred by InfraREIT (including a management agreement termination fee of $40 million that InfraREIT paid an affiliate of Hunt Consolidated, Inc. at closing), with the aggregate cash consideration and payment of certain InfraREIT expenses totaling $1,324 million. In connection with and immediately after the closing of the InfraREIT Acquisition, on May 16, 2019, we also extinguished all $953 million aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt of\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nCash Flows - Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\n\ufeff\nSignificant Activities and Events\nCyber Security and Infrastructure Protection Risk\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nThe effective income tax rate was 15.9% and 17.7% for the 2019 and 2018 periods, respectively. The effective tax rate on pretax income differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the amortization of the regulatory liability for excess deferred taxes as a result of the TCJA, partially offset by the effects of the Texas margin tax.\nProvision in lieu of income taxes totaled $123 million (including a $15 million benefit related to nonoperating income) in 2019 compared to $117 million (including a $35 million benefit related to nonoperating income) in 2018.\n\ufeff\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nBUSINESS\n\ufeff\nWe offer certain pension, health care and life insurance benefits to eligible employees (and certain eligible former employees of EFH Corp. and Vistra whose service was partially assigned to Oncor in connection with the deregulation and disaggregation of EFH Corp.'s electric utility business in 2002) and their eligible dependents upon the retirement of such employees as we discuss in Note 10 to Financial Statements. We are authorized to establish a regulatory asset or liability for the difference between the amounts of pension and OPEB costs reflected in our PUCT-approved billing rates and the actual amounts that would otherwise have been recorded as charges or credits to earnings related to recoverable service. Accordingly, we recognize (principally as a regulatory asset or property) additional pension and OPEB costs consistent with PURA. Amounts deferred are ultimately subject to regulatory approval.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 should be read in conjunction with Selected Financial Data and our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements.\n \u00b7 capital expenditure commitments made as part of the Sempra Acquisition (see Note 8 to Financial Statements); and \nSee EECRF Filings Table below for a listing of EECRF filings impacting revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, as well as filings that will impact revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\ufeff\nAvailable Liquidity - Our primary source of liquidity, aside from operating cash flows, has been our ability to borrow under our Credit Facility, which also supports our CP Program. Because the CP Program is supported by the Credit Facility, CP Notes outstanding is a reduction to the available borrowing capacity. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $4 million and $3 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Considering CP Notes and letters of credit outstanding, available liquidity (cash and available Credit Facility borrowing capacity) at December 31, 2019 totaled $1,948 million, reflecting an increase of $767 million from December 31, 2018 primarily due to the issuance of new long-term debt and the repayment of CP Notes.\nRing-Fencing Measures\nCash used in investing activities totaled $3,378 million and $1,749 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The $1,629 million increase is primarily due to the $1,324 million purchase price paid for the InfraREIT Acquisition and a $330 million increase in capital expenditures for transmission and distribution facilities to serve new customers and infrastructure capital maintenance spending in the current period. The Other\u201d line includes proceeds of $18 million from the sale of certain distribution assets. For more details on the purchase price paid for the InfraREIT Acquisition, see Note 2 to Financial Statements.\nThe Texas Legislature meets every two years. During the 2019 legislative session, no legislation passed that is expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n\n\ufeff\nRates and Cost Recovery\nOn May 9, 2019, the PUCT issued a final order in Docket No. 48929 approving the transactions contemplated by the InfraREIT Acquisition, including the SDTS-SU Asset Exchange, and the Sempra-Sharyland Transaction. For more information on the InfraREIT Acquisition, see Note 2 to Financial Statements. In March 2018, the PUCT issued a final order in Docket No. 47675 regarding the Sempra Acquisition. For more information on the Sempra Acquisition, see Note 14 to Financial Statements.\nVarious ring-fencing measures have been taken to enhance our credit quality and the separateness between the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities, Sempra and its affiliates (other than the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities), and any other entities with a direct or indirect ownership interest in Oncor or Oncor Holdings. These measures serve to mitigate the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities' credit exposure to Sempra and its affiliates and any other direct or indirect owners of Oncor and Oncor Holdings, and to reduce the risk that the assets and liabilities of Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities would be substantively consolidated with the assets and liabilities of any Sempra entity or any other direct or indirect owners of Oncor and Oncor Holdings in connection with a bankruptcy of any such entities. Such measures include, among other things: the 19.75% equity interest held by Texas Transmission; maintenance of separate books and records for the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities; and our board of directors being comprised of a majority of directors who meet certain disinterested director standards. As a result, none of the assets of the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities are available to satisfy the debt or obligations of any Sempra entity or any other direct or indirect owner of Oncor or Oncor Holdings. The assets and liabilities of the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities are separate and distinct from those of any Sempra entities and any other direct or indirect owner of Oncor or Oncor Holdings. We do not bear any liability for debt or contractual obligations of Sempra and its affiliates or any other direct or indirect owner of Oncor or Oncor Holdings, and vice versa. Accordingly, our operations are conducted, and our cash flows are managed, independently from Sempra and its affiliates and any other direct or indirect owner of Oncor or Oncor Holdings. For more information on the ring-fencing measures, see Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties - Ring-Fencing Measures.\u201d\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nWe also evaluate goodwill for impairment annually on October 1 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. The determination of the existence of these and other indications of impairment involves judgments that are subjective in nature and may require the use of estimates in forecasting future results and cash flows.\nTaxes other than income taxes increased $12 million, or 2%, to $508 million in 2019. The increase is primarily due to $28 million higher property taxes in the current period including $16 million related to the InfraREIT Acquisition and $4 million higher local franchise fees, partially offset by $20 million expense in the prior period related to recovery of certain municipal franchise fees as part of the 2017 rate review.\n\ufeff\nThe January 2020 Term Loan Agreement contains customary covenants for facilities of this type, restricting, subject to certain exceptions, us and our subsidiaries from, among other things: incurring certain additional liens (not including liens relating to obligations secured pursuant to our Deed of Trust, which are permitted); entering into mergers and consolidations; sales of substantial assets and acquisitions and investments in subsidiaries. The January 2020 Term Loan Agreement also contains a senior debt-to-capitalization ratio covenant that effectively limits our ability to incur indebtedness in the future. See Credit Rating Provisions, Covenants and Cross Default Provisions\u201d below for additional information on this covenant and the calculation of this ratio.\nPresented below are the credit ratings assigned for our debt securities at February 27, 2020.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nDebt-Related Activity - In May 2019, we issued (i) $351 million of senior secured notes under the Note Purchase Agreements in exchange for a like principal amount of notes issued by InfraREIT subsidiaries, (ii) $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.75% senior secured notes due 2024 (2024 Notes), (iii) $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.70% senior secured notes due 2028 (2028 Notes) and (iv) $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.80% senior secured notes due 2049 (3.80% 2049 Notes). In September 2019, we (i) issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of 3.10% senior secured notes due 2049 (3.10% 2049 Notes) and (ii) entered in to and borrowed $460 million under a term loan credit agreement that matures on October 6, 2020. Repayments of long-term debt consisted of $488 million aggregate principal amount of certain InfraREIT-related long-term debt in connection with and immediately following the closing of the InfraREIT Acquisition, $250 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes, $350 million aggregate principal amount under a previous term loan credit agreement and $6 million principal amount of the quarterly amortizing debt for our notes issued under the Note Purchase Agreements.

The 2019 Term Loan Agreement also contains a senior debt-to-capitalization ratio covenant that effectively limits our ability to incur indebtedness in the future. At December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with this covenant and all other covenants in the 2019 Term Loan Agreement. See Credit Rating Provisions, Covenants and Cross Default Provisions\u201d below for additional information on this covenant and the calculation of this ratio. While it was in effect, the 2018 Term Loan Agreement contained similar covenants to the 2019 Term Loan Agreement.\nUnder the Deed of Trust, an event of default under our indentures or, after all applicable notices have been given and all applicable grace periods have expired, under the Note Purchase Agreements, would permit the holders of our senior secured notes to exercise their remedies under the Deed of Trust.\nDepreciation and amortization expense reported in the statements of consolidated cash flows was $83 million and $106 million more than the amounts reported in the statements of consolidated income for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The differences result from certain regulatory asset amortization reported in operation and maintenance expense and taxes other than income taxes.\n\ufeff\nInterest expense and related charges were $375 million and $351 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively. The $24 million increase is primarily driven by a $61 million increase due to higher average borrowings including $27 million related to the InfraREIT Acquisition, partially offset by a $36 million decrease attributable to lower average interest rates.\nWe entered into a $350 million aggregate principal amount term loan credit agreement in December 2018 (2018 Term Loan Agreement) that was repaid in full in November 2019.\nAll dollar amounts in the tables in the following discussion and analysis are stated in millions of U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated.\nFinancial Results \u2500 Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nCash Distributions - The PUCT order issued in the Sempra Acquisition and our Limited Liability Company Agreement set forth various restrictions on distributions to our members. Among those restrictions is the commitment that we will make no distributions that would cause us to be out of compliance with the PUCT's approved debt-to-equity ratio, which is currently 57.5% debt to 42.5% equity. The distribution restrictions also include the ability of our board, a majority of the Disinterested Directors, or either of the two member directors designated by Texas Transmission to limit distributions to the extent each determines it is necessary to meet expected future requirements of Oncor (including continuing compliance with the PUCT debt-to-equity ratio commitment). At December 31, 2019, we had $751 million available to distribute to our members as our regulatory capitalization ratio was 54.8% debt to 45.2% equity.\n(b) Excludes impacts of the Sharyland 2017Asset Exchange.\n\ufeff\nWholesale transmission service expense increased $43 million, or 4%, to $1,005 million in 2019 primarily due to higher fees paid to other transmission entities.\nmember capital contributions or preserve equity through reductions or suspension of distributions to members. In addition, we may also consider additional new debt issuances, repurchases, exchange offers and other transactions in order to refinance or manage our long-term debt. The inability to raise capital on favorable terms or failure of counterparties to perform under credit or other financial agreements, particularly during any uncertainty in the financial markets, could impact our ability to sustain and grow the business and would likely increase capital costs that may not be recoverable through rates.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nBenefit costs are impacted by actual and actuarial estimates of employee demographics (including but not limited to age, compensation levels and years of accredited service), future health care costs, the level of contributions made to retiree plans, expected and actual earnings on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation. Actuarial assumptions are reviewed and updated annually based on current economic conditions and trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future benefit costs. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased or decreased benefit costs in future periods.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nUnder the Credit Facility, our term loan credit agreements and the Note Purchase Agreements, a default by us or any subsidiary in respect of indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of $100 million or any judgments for the payment of money in excess of $100 million that are not discharged within 60 days may cause the maturity of outstanding balances under those facilities to be accelerated.\n o $21 million decrease due to lower consumption driven primarily by weather. \nAmounts payable to and receivable from members related to income taxes on our balance sheet reflect our tax provision net of quarterly estimated tax payments required by the tax sharing agreement that are trued up the following year when the annual tax return is filed.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nOn February 19, 2020, our board of directors declared a cash distribution of $91 million, which was paid to our members on February 20, 2020.

Risks to our key technology platforms include nonperformance by equipment and service providers, failure of the technology to meet performance expectations and inadequate cost recovery allowances by regulatory authorities. We continue to implement measures to mitigate these risks, including business continuity and disaster recovery plans, but there can be no assurance that these measures will achieve the operational and financial objectives.\nSee Note 8 to Financial Statements for details of commitments and contingencies.\n\ufeff\nFor information on other regulatory proceedings, see Note 3 to Financial Statements.\nJanuary 2020 Term Loan Credit Agreement - On January 28, 2020, we executed a $450 million term loan credit agreement that matures on June 1, 2021 (January 2020 Term Loan Agreement). The January 2020 Term Loan Agreement provides that we can borrow the full amount in up to four borrowings by April 27, 2020. On January 29, 2020, we borrowed $163 million under the January 2020 Term Loan Agreement and on February 25, 2020, we submitted an irrevocable borrowing notice for a $55 million borrowing, to be made on February 28, 2020. The proceeds from each borrowing are to be used for general corporate purposes. Loans under the January 2020 Term Loan Agreement bear interest at per annum rates equal to, at our option, (i) LIBOR plus 0.50% until June 1, 2021, or (ii) an alternate base rate (the highest of (1) the prime rate of Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, the administrative agent under the agreement, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and (3) daily one-month LIBOR plus 1%).\n (a) See Note 7 to Financial Statements for more information regarding our long-term debt. \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n o $12 million increase due to NTU wholesale distribution substation service revenue following the closing of the InfraREIT Acquisition. \nOur tax sharing agreement with Oncor Holdings, STH (as successor to EFH Corp.) and Texas Transmission provides for the calculation of amounts related to income taxes for each of Oncor Holdings and Oncor substantially as if these entities were taxed as corporations and requires payments to the members determined on that basis (without duplication for any income taxes paid by a subsidiary of Oncor Holdings).\nOperating Data\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nAccounting for the Effects of Income Taxes\nPension and OPEB Plans Funding - Our funding for the pension and Oncor OPEB plans for the calendar year 2020 is expected to total $177 million and $35 million, respectively. Based on the funded status of the pension plans at December 31, 2019, our aggregate pension and Oncor OPEB plans funding is expected to total approximately $747 million in the five year period 2020 to 2024. In 2019, we made cash contributions to the pension and OPEB plans of $41 million and $35 million, respectively.

If our credit ratings decline, the costs to operate our business could increase because counterparties could require the posting of collateral in the form of cash-related instruments, or counterparties could decline to do business with us.\nLong-Term Debt Activity in 2019\n related to rate case expenses and recovery of certain municipal franchise fees as part of the 2017 rate review, offset by a $4 million increase in energy efficiency program costs. \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nAs described in Note 6 to Financial Statements, we established the CP Program in March 2018. The CP Program obtains liquidity support from our Credit Facility. As described in Note 7 to Financial Statements, our long-term debt (other than the $460 million unsecured term loan credit agreement we entered into in September 2019) is currently secured pursuant to the Deed of Trust by a first priority lien on certain of our transmission and distribution assets and is considered senior secured debt.\n\n\ufeff\nOur consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, include the results of our wholly owned, indirect subsidiary, NTU, which is a regulated utility that provides electricity transmission delivery service in the north-central, western and panhandle regions of Texas. We acquired NTU as part of the InfraREIT Acquisition that closed on May 16, 2019.\n\ufeff\nLong-Term Debt Repayments - Repayments of long-term debt during 2019 consisted of repayment of $488 million aggregate principal amount of certain InfraREIT-related long-term debt on May 16, 2019, in connection with and immediately following the closing of the InfraREIT Acquisition, $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.15% senior secured notes due June 1, 2019, $350 million aggregate principal amount under the 2018 Term Loan Agreement, and $6 million principal amount of the quarterly amortizing debt for our 2020 Notes, 2029 Notes and 2030 Notes.\n\ufeff\n o $26 million increase due to growth in points of delivery, \nMaterial Cross Default Provisions - Certain financing arrangements contain provisions that may result in an event of default if there was a failure under other financing arrangements to meet payment terms or to observe other covenants that could result in an acceleration of payments due. Such provisions are referred to as cross default\u201d provisions.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 An Increase in TCRF - third-party wholesale transmission service (TCRF Third-Party) - TCRF revenues increased $43 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. TCRF is a reconcilable distribution rate charged to REPs to recover fees we pay to third-party transmission service providers under their TCOS rates and the retail portion of our own TCOS rate described above. Changes in our TCRF Third-Party revenue are to pass through an increase in third-party wholesale transmission service expense. At December 31, 2019, $30 million was deferred as over-recovered wholesale transmission service expense (see Note 3 to Financial Statements). PUCT rules require us to update the TCRF component of our retail delivery rates on March 1 and September 1 each year. \n\n\ufeff\nMatters with the PUCT - See discussion below under Regulation and Rates - Matters with the PUCT\u201d.\n\ufeff\n (b) This docket includes a $12 million annual revenue reduction for excess deferred taxes related to the Docket No. 48325 (TCJA) line below. \nAvailable Liquidity/CP Program/Credit Facility/Short-Term Borrowings\n \u00b7 employment contracts with management; \nSee TCOS Filings Table below for a listing of transmission interim rate update applications and anticipated impacts on revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, as well as filings and the anticipated impact to revenues for the year ending December 31, 2020.\nRegulatory Capital Structure -We have committed to the PUCT to maintain a regulatory capital structure at or below the assumed debt-to-equity ratio established periodically by the PUCT for ratemaking purposes, which is 57.5% debt to 42.5% equity as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. Our current regulatory assumed debt-to-equity ratio went into effect on November 27, 2017 as part of the PUCT order issued in the rate review we filed in PUCT Docket No. 46957. Our regulatory capitalization ratio was 54.8% debt to 45.2% equity and 57.3% debt to 42.7% equity at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. See Note 9 to Financial Statements for discussion of the regulatory capitalization ratio and Note 3 to Financial Statements for a discussion of our 2017 rate review (PUCT Docket No. 46957). Our ability to incur additional long-term debt is limited by our regulatory capital structure, as we are able to issue future long-term debt only to the extent that we are in compliance therewith.\nSee Notes 1 and 5 to Financial Statements for additional information.\n\nOther deductions and (income) - net was $21 million favorable in 2019 compared to 2018. The variance is primarily due to allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) equity income recorded in the current period and Sempra Acquisition related costs reflected in the prior period. See Note 13 to Financial Statements for more information.\n o $142 million increase due to the InfraREIT Acquisition, and \nLiquidity Needs, Including Capital Expenditures - Our board of directors, which annually approves capital expenditure estimates for the following year, has approved capital expenditures totaling $2.5 billion in 2020. Management currently expects to recommend to our board of directors capital expenditures of $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion in each of the years 2021 through 2024, for a total of $11.9 billion for the five year period 2020 through 2024, based on the long-term plan presented to our board of directors. These capital expenditures are expected to be used for investment in transmission and distribution infrastructure, including expansion, maintenance and information technology. In connection with the PUCT approval of the Sempra Acquisition, we committed to making a minimum of $7.5 billion in capital expenditures over the period from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2022. As a result of our projected capital expenditures and our 2019 and 2018 capital expenditures of $2.1 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, we expect to exceed that minimum spend.\n____________\nIn each of 2019, 2018 and 2017, we concluded, based on a qualitative assessment, that our estimated enterprise fair value was more likely than not greater than our carrying value. As a result, no additional testing for impairment was required and no impairments were recognized.\nState Legislation\nWe evaluate long-lived assets (including intangible assets with finite lives) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\nUnder the terms of the Credit Facility, the commitments of the lenders to make loans to us are several and not joint. Accordingly, if any lender fails to make loans to us, our available liquidity could be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender's commitments under the facility. See Note 6 to Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Credit Facility.\nREGULATION AND RATES\n\n\ufeff\nItem 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nDepreciation and amortization increased $52 million to $723 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to ongoing investments in property, plant and equipment and $29 million from property, plant and equipment acquired in the InfraREIT Acquisition.\nWe are a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, while partnerships are not subject to income taxes, in consideration of the presentation of our financial statements as an entity subject to cost-based regulatory rate-setting processes with such costs historically including income taxes and the tax sharing agreement, the financial statements present amounts determined under the tax sharing agreement as provision in lieu of income taxes\u201d and liability in lieu of deferred income taxes\u201d. Such amounts are determined in accordance with the provisions of the accounting guidance for income taxes and accounting standards that provide interpretive guidance for accounting for uncertain tax positions and thus differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities are accounted for as if we were a stand-alone corporation. In the event such amounts are not paid under the tax sharing agreement, it is probable that this regulatory liability will continue to be included in Oncor's rate setting processes.\n\ufeff\nRevenues that contribute to earnings increased $224 million during 2019. The change reflected the following components:\n\ufeff\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nOperation and maintenance expense increased $24 million, or 3%, to $899 million in 2019. The increase includes $9 million higher labor and contractor related costs, $8 million in higher materials and transportation costs and $4 million higher energy efficiency program costs.\n\ufeff\nCash provided by operating activities totaled $1,275 million and $1,482 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The $207 million decrease is primarily the result of a $162 million increase in storm costs, a $66 million decrease in transmission and distribution receipts, a $27 million increase in materials and supply purchases, and a $23 million increase in interest payments. The decreases were partially offset by $47 million of lower employee benefit plan funding and $15 million of higher stock-based compensation related payments in the prior period.\nWe are subject to rate regulation and our financial statements reflect regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with GAAP related to the effect of certain types of regulation. Regulatory assets and liabilities represent probable future revenues that will be recovered from or refunded to customers through the ratemaking process based on PURA and/or the PUCT's orders, precedents or substantive rules. Rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital subject to PUCT review for reasonableness and prudence and possible disallowance. Regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate earned on invested capital and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. See Note 3 to Financial Statements for more information regarding regulatory assets and liabilities.\nCapitalization - Our GAAP capitalization ratios were 42.6% and 40.8% long-term debt, less amounts due currently, to 57.4% and 59.2% membership interests at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. See Note 9 to Financial Statements for discussion of the regulatory capitalization ratio.\n__________\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nOur rates are regulated by the PUCT and certain cities and are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and annual earnings oversight. This regulatory treatment does not provide any assurance as to achievement of earnings levels. Our rates are regulated based on an analysis of our costs and capital structure, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding. Rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. However, there is no assurance that the PUCT will judge all of our costs to have been prudently incurred, that the PUCT will not reduce the amount of invested capital included in the capital structure that our rates are based upon, that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will always result in rates that produce full recovery of our costs or that our authorized return on equity will not be reduced. See Regulation and Rates\u201d below for further information.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nA breach of our cyber/data or physical security measures that impairs our information technology infrastructure or transmission and distribution infrastructure could disrupt normal business operations, affect our ability to control our transmission and distribution system, expose us to material regulatory claims and limit communication with third parties. Any loss of confidential or proprietary data through a cyber/data breach, including a breach involving one of our third-party vendors, could also materially affect our reputation, expose the company to legal claims and fines or impair our ability to execute on business strategies. If third parties in our supply chain experience cyber attacks, the services they provide us could be disrupted. This disruption could interfere with our ability to perform our obligations to others, which could negatively affect our financial condition and reputation. In addition, the theft, damage, or improper disclosure of sensitive data held by these third parties may subject us to further harm. We participate in industry groups and with regulators to remain current on emerging threats and mitigating techniques. While we have not experienced any security breach with a significant operational, reputational or financial impact, we recognize the growing threat within our industry and are proactively taking steps to continuously improve our technology, security measures, processes and services to detect, mitigate and protect our assets, both physical and cyber.\nCapital Availability and Cost\n\ufeff\nSenior Secured Notes Issuances - In May 2019, we issued (i) $351 million of senior secured notes under the Note Purchase Agreements in exchange for a like principal amount of notes issued by InfraREIT subsidiaries, (ii) $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2024 Notes, (iii) $300 million aggregate principal amount of 2028 Notes and (iv) $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.80% 2049 Notes. In September 2019, we issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of 3.10% 2049 Notes (3.10% 2049 Notes and, together with the 2024 Notes, 2028 Notes and the 3.80% 2049 Notes, the New Indenture Notes).\nNet income was $106 million higher than the prior period, primarily driven by an increase in revenues that contribute to earnings, the impacts of the InfraREIT Acquisition and favorable other income including AFUDC equity, partially offset by increases in operation and maintenance expense, property taxes, depreciation and amortization and a TCJA related write-off in the prior period.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n o $18 million increase due to the effects of the DCRF rate increases effective September 1, 2019, and \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nconsolidated basis) divided by the sum of total debt plus capitalization. Capitalization under the Note Purchase Agreements is calculated as membership interests plus liabilities for indebtedness maturing more than 12 months from the date of determination, with capitalization determined in accordance with GAAP and practices applicable to our type of business. At December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with this covenant and all other covenants under the Credit Facility, 2019 Term Loan Agreement and Note Purchase Agreements.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 An Increase in Transmission Base Revenues - Transmission base revenues (or TCOS revenues) increased $214 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. TCOS revenues are collected from load serving entities benefitting from our transmission system. REPs serving customers in our service territory are billed through the TCRF mechanism discussed below, while other load serving entities are billed directly. In order to reflect changes in our invested transmission capital, PUCT rules allow us to update our TCOS rates by filing up to two interim TCOS rate adjustments in a calendar year. The increase in TCOS revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 reflects a: \nCredit Facility - At December 31, 2019, we had a $2.0 billion unsecured Credit Facility to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, issuance of letters of credit and to support our CP Program with a five-year term expiring in November 2022. We have the option of requesting up to two one-year extensions and an option to request an increase in our borrowing capacity of $400 million, in increments of not less than $100 million, provided certain conditions are met, including lender approvals. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are classified as short-term on our balance sheets. At December 31, 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility.\n\ufeff\nIn May 2019, we entered into the short-term Bridge Loan, borrowing an aggregate principal amount of $600 million, which was subsequently repaid on May 23, 2019. In connection with the closing of the InfraREIT Acquisition, on May 16, 2019, the short-term credit facilities of InfraREIT and its subsidiaries were terminated and borrowings totaling $114 million aggregate principal amount were repaid in full by Oncor. See Note 6 to Financial Statements for additional information regarding short-term debt and Note 2 to Financial Statements regarding the InfraREIT Acquisition.\n________________\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nOur 2018 Form 10-K includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 in Item 7 of Part II, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTotal operating revenues increased $246 million, or 6%, to $4.347 billion in 2019. Revenue is billed under tariffs approved by the PUCT.\nThe following are not included in the table above:\nCredit Rating Provisions, Covenants and Cross Default Provisions\nMay 2019 Short-Term Bridge Loan - On May 9, 2019, we entered into the Bridge Loan, a short-term, unsecured term loan credit agreement in an aggregate principal amount of up to $600 million in connection with the InfraREIT Acquisition. The Bridge Loan had a six-month term, maturing on November 9, 2019. We borrowed $600 million under the Bridge Loan on May 15, 2019 and used the proceeds to repay certain debt of InfraREIT subsidiaries. We repaid all outstanding amounts under the Bridge Loan in full on May 23, 2019, and as a result the Bridge Loan is no longer in effect. See Note 6 to Financial Statements for more information relating to the Bridge Loan and its repayment.\nThe CP Program obtains liquidity support from our Credit Facility discussed below. We may utilize either the CP Program or the Credit Facility at our option for funding. See Note 6 to Financial Statements for additional information regarding the CP Program.\n\ufeff\nFollowing is a discussion of key risks and challenges facing management and the initiatives currently underway to manage such challenges. For additional information concerning risk factors related to our business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in this report.\nSee TCRF Filings Table below for a listing of TCRF filings impacting cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, as well as filings and the anticipated impacts to cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nSummary\n\ufeff\nBecause the CP Program is supported by the Credit Facility, CP Notes outstanding reduce the available borrowing capacity. Considering the CP Notes outstanding and the limitations described below, available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility totaled $1,944 million and $1,178 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nSee the DCRF Filings Table below for a listing of annual filings impacting revenues for 2019 and 2018.\n \u00b7 A Net Decrease in EECRF and Other Regulatory Surcharges - EECRF and other regulatory surcharge revenues decreased by $21 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The EECRF is a reconcilable rate designed to recover current energy efficiency program costs and performance bonuses earned by exceeding PUCT targets in prior years and to refund or recover any over/under recovery of our costs in prior years. We recognize the performance bonuses in other miscellaneous revenues upon approval by the PUCT. PUCT rules require us to file an annual EECRF tariff update by the first business day in June of each year for implementation on March 1 of the next calendar year. The net decrease includes a $25 million reduction due to cessation of certain surcharges \n\ufeff\nMaterial Financial Covenants - Our Credit Facility, our term loan credit agreements and the Note Purchase Agreements each contain a financial covenant that requires maintenance of a consolidated debt-to-capitalization ratio of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00. For purposes of this ratio, debt is calculated as indebtedness defined in the applicable agreement (principally, the sum of long-term debt, any capital leases (referred to as finance leases under current accounting literature), short-term debt and debt due currently in accordance with GAAP). Capitalization for our Credit Facility and term loan credit agreements is calculated as membership interests determined in accordance with GAAP plus debt described above. The ratio under our Note Purchase Agreements is calculated as total debt (all debt of the company and subsidiaries on a\n\ufeff\nThe 2019 Term Loan Agreement contains customary covenants for facilities of this type, restricting, subject to certain exceptions, us and our subsidiaries from, among other things: incurring certain additional liens (not including liens relating to obligations secured pursuant to our Deed of Trust, which are permitted); entering into mergers and consolidations; sales\nRevenues collected for pass-through expenses include the following components.

These revenues increased $22 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 and the change reflected:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 An Increase in Distribution Base Revenues - Distribution base rates are set periodically in a rate review docket initiated by either us or the PUCT. The PUCT allows utilities to file, under certain circumstances, once per year to recover distribution investments and certain other related costs on an interim basis. The $4 million increase in distribution base rate revenues primarily reflects: \n(a) Monthly charges are for a residential customer using an assumed 1,200 kWh.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTCRF Filings Table\n o Partially offset by a $11 million decrease due to the refund of excess deferred federal income taxes resulting from the TCJA, and \n\ufeff\nUse of Proceeds - We used the proceeds (net of the initial purchasers' discount, fees, expenses and accrued interest) of $2,446 million from the sale of the New Indenture Notes and borrowings on the 2019 Term Loan Agreement for general corporate purposes, including to repay all amounts outstanding under the Bridge Loan, to repay our $250 million aggregate principal amount of 2.15% Senior Secured Notes due June 1, 2019 and to repay CP Notes, when due, under our CP Program. For more information on the Bridge Loan, see Note 6 to Financial Statements. See Note 7 to Financial Statements for additional information regarding repayments, redemptions and issuances of long-term debt.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nWe are a regulated electricity transmission and distribution company principally engaged in providing delivery services to REPs that sell power in the north-central, eastern, western and panhandle regions of Texas. We are a majority-owned subsidiary of Oncor Holdings, which is indirectly and wholly owned by Sempra. Oncor Holdings owns 80.25% of our outstanding membership interests and Texas Transmission owns 19.75% of our outstanding membership interests. We are managed as an integrated business; consequently, there is only one reportable segment.\nSee Note 10 to Financial Statements regarding other disclosures related to pension and OPEB plans obligations.\nWe cannot predict future regulatory or legislative actions or any changes in economic and securities market conditions. Such actions or changes could significantly alter our basic financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe expect cash flows from operations combined with long-term debt issuances and term loan credit agreements as well as availability under the CP Program and Credit Facility to provide sufficient liquidity to fund current obligations, projected working capital requirements, maturities of long-term debt and capital spending for at least the next twelve months. Should additional liquidity or capital requirements arise, we may need additional access to capital markets, seek\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nwe were in compliance with all covenants in the Credit Facility. See Credit Rating Provisions, Covenants and Cross Default Provisions\u201d below for additional information on this covenant and the calculation of this ratio.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTCOS Filings Table\n \u00b7 individual contracts that have an annual cash requirement of less than $1 million (however, multiple contracts with one counterparty that are more than $1 million on an aggregated basis have been included); \n\ufeff\n (a) This application is pending. \nOur access to capital markets and cost of debt could be directly affected by our credit ratings. Any adverse action with respect to our credit ratings could generally cause borrowing costs to increase and the potential pool of investors and funding sources to decrease. Our credit ratings are currently higher than those of Sempra. If credit rating agencies were to change their views of our independence from Sempra and its affiliates (other than the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities), our credit ratings could decline. We believe this risk is substantially mitigated by the ring-fencing measures as described in Notes 1 and 2 to Financial Statements. See Risk Factors-Adverse actions with respect to our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital\u201d, and In the future, we could have liquidity needs that could be difficult to satisfy under some circumstances, especially in uncertain financial market conditions.\u201d\n\ufeff\nKEY RISKS AND CHALLENGES\nThe Credit Facility contains customary covenants for facilities of this type, restricting, subject to certain exceptions, us and our subsidiaries from, among other things: incurring certain additional liens (not including liens relating to obligations secured pursuant to our Deed of Trust, which are permitted); entering into mergers and consolidations; sales of substantial assets and acquisitions and investments in subsidiaries. The Credit Facility also contains a senior debt-to-capitalization ratio covenant that effectively limits our ability to incur indebtedness in the future.

Company's financial results and condition. The key points are:\n\n- Oncor is a regulated electricity transmission and distribution company in Texas. It is majority owned by Oncor Holdings and Sempra.\n\n- In 2019, Oncor had total operating revenues of $4.347 billion, up 6% from 2018. Revenues contributing to earnings were $3.292 billion. Major revenue changes included increases in transmission and distribution base revenues, TCRF third-party revenues, and other miscellaneous revenues. \n\n- Net income was $106 million higher in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to increased revenues, impacts of the InfraREIT acquisition, and favorable other income.\n\n- Oncor completed the $1.3 billion acquisition of InfraREIT in May 2019, which expanded its footprint in Texas.\n\n- Capital expenditures were $2.1 billion in 2019, up from $1.8 billion in 2018, largely due to the InfraREIT acquisition.\n\n- Total debt increased in 2019 due to new debt issuances and capital contributions related to the InfraREIT acquisition. The debt-to-equity ratio remained stable. \n\n- Cash provided by operations was $1.275 billion in 2019, down from $1.482 billion in 2018, largely due to higher storm costs and interest payments.\n\nThe report contains several tables summarizing financial results, debt activity, rate case impacts, and other regulatory and operational metrics. It also discusses key risks like capital availability, technology, and cyber security."}
