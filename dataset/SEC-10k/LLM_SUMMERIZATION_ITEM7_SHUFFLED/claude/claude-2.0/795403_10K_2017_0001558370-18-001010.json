MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOverview\nWe are a leading supplier of products and solutions that conserve water and manage the flow of fluids and energy into, through and out of buildings in the residential and commercial markets of the Americas, Europe and APMEA. For over 140 years, we have designed and produced valve systems that safeguard and regulate water systems, energy efficient heating and hydronic systems, drainage systems and water filtration technology that helps conserve water. We earn revenue and income almost exclusively from the sale of our products. Our principal product lines include:\nTable 47: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nResidential & commercial flow control products-includes products typically sold into plumbing and hot water applications such as backflow preventers, water pressure regulators, temperature and pressure relief valves, and thermostatic mixing valves.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 48: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nHVAC & gas products-includes commercial high-efficiency boilers, water heaters and heating solutions, hydronic and electric heating systems for under-floor radiant applications, custom heat and hot water solutions, hydronic pump groups for boiler manufacturers and alternative energy control packages, and flexible stainless steel connectors for natural and liquid propane gas in commercial food service and residential applications. HVAC is an acronym for heating, ventilation and air conditioning.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 49: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDrainage & water re-use products-includes drainage products and engineered rain water harvesting solutions for commercial, industrial, marine and residential applications.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 50: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWater quality products-includes point-of-use and point-of-entry water filtration, conditioning and scale prevention systems for both commercial and residential applications.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur business is reported in three geographic segments: Americas, Europe, and APMEA. We distribute our products through four primary distribution channels: wholesale, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), specialty, and do-it-yourself (DIY). In September 2015, we divested a substantial portion of our DIY business in the Americas, which reduced the significance of DIY as a distribution channel for our products in 2017 and 2016.\nPrior to 2017, our Europe segment was formerly referred to as EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) and our APMEA segment was formerly referred to as Asia-Pacific. As of January 1, 2017, we began reporting the results of Watts Industries Middle East, an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary, within our APMEA segment to align with internal operating changes. These results had previously been reported within our former EMEA segment. This change does not affect our reportable segments but represents only a change in composition that better aligns with the structure of our internal organization. The 2016 and 2015 results by segment have been retrospectively revised for comparative purposes.\nWe believe that the factors relating to our future growth include continued product innovation that meets the needs of our customers and our end markets; our ability to make selective acquisitions, both in our core markets as well as in new complementary markets; regulatory requirements relating to the quality and conservation of water and the safe use of water; increased demand for clean water; continued enforcement of plumbing and building codes; and a healthy economic environment. We have completed 10 acquisitions in the last decade. Our acquisition strategy focuses on businesses that promote our key macro themes around safety & regulation, energy efficiency and water conservation. We target businesses that will provide us with one or more of the following: an entry into new markets and/or new geographies, improved channel access, unique and/or proprietary technologies, advanced production capabilities or complementary solution offerings.\nOur innovation strategy is focused on differentiated products that provide greater opportunity to distinguish ourselves in the market place. Conversely, we want to migrate away from commoditized products where we cannot add value. Our\ngoal is to be a solutions provider, not merely a components supplier. We continually look for strategic opportunities to invest in new products and markets or divest existing product lines where necessary in order to meet those objectives.\nProducts representing a majority of our sales are subject to regulatory standards and code enforcement, which typically require that these products meet stringent performance criteria. Together with our commissioned manufacturers' representatives, we have consistently advocated for the development and enforcement of such plumbing codes. We are focused on maintaining stringent quality control and testing procedures at each of our manufacturing facilities in order to manufacture products in compliance with code requirements and take advantage of the resulting demand for compliant products. We believe that the product development, product testing capability and investment in plant and equipment needed to manufacture products in compliance with code requirements, represent a competitive advantage for us.\nIn 2017, we successfully completed our transformation programs and realized the benefits of our product portfolio rationalization, footprint optimization, and global sourcing initiatives, while simultaneously reinvesting in the business. We continued to drive commercial and operational excellence. We completed the integration of PVI Industries, LLC ( PVI\u201d) to our portfolio during the year. We continued to streamline our product portfolio across the regions as we focus on our core product lines and rationalize certain low-margin, non-core products. Our financial performance in 2017 was solid, driven by growth in the Americas and Europe segments and realization of our productivity and transformation savings.\nThe 2017 Tax Act has resulted in significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system and was enacted on December 22, 2017. These changes include a federal statutory rate reduction from 35% to 21% effective on January 1, 2018, the elimination or reduction of certain domestic deductions and credits, and limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation. The 2017 Tax Act transitions international taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system and includes base erosion prevention measures on non-U.S. earnings. The 2017 Tax Act also includes a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign subsidiaries' previously untaxed foreign earnings ( Toll Tax\u201d).\nChanges in tax rates and tax laws are accounted for in the period of enactment and deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the enacted tax rate. Therefore, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a charge totaling $25.1 million related to our current estimate of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act, including an estimated $23.3 million expense under the Toll Tax. The Toll Tax will be paid over an eight-year period, starting in 2018, and will not accrue interest. The provisions of the 2017 Tax Act allows us more flexibility in deploying our global cash resources as we continue to drive a balanced capital allocation strategy. We expect that the 2017 Tax Act will have a positive effect on our income tax rate in 2018.\nOverall, reported sales for 2017 increased 4.2%, or $58.3 million, primarily related to an increase in acquired sales of $47.0 million, or 3.3%, relating to the acquisitions of PVI and Watts Korea, an increase in organic sales of $7.0 million, or 0.5%, and an increase in sales due to foreign exchange of $7.8 million, or 0.7%.This increase was partially offset by a decrease in sales of $3.5 million related to product lines we divested by the first quarter of 2016 in the Americas segment as part of our Americas transformation program. Compared to 2016, reported sales as a percentage of segment sales in the Americas and Europe increased by 5.6% and 2.1%, respectively, while reported sales in APMEA declined by 2.6%. As a percentage of segment sales, organic sales in the Americas and Europe increased 0.8% and 0.6% respectively, while organic sales in APMEA declined by 4.6% compared to 2016. The increase in organic sales in the Americas was primarily driven by increased sales in our valve, HVAC, and drainage products, partially offset by declines in our tankless water heater and condensing boiler products. In Europe, the increase was primarily driven by our drains and electronics products, offset by a decline in our plumbing products due to the impact of product rationalization. The decline in APMEA sales primarily related to the impact of product rationalization, partially offset by increased demand for our underfloor heating products and commercial valves and growth in Korea. Operating income of $162.3 million increased by $17.3 million, or 11.9% compared to 2016. This increase is driven by incremental transformation and productivity savings, lower transformation costs, the acquisition of PVI, and higher sales volume.\nOrganic sales is a non-GAAP measure that excludes the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. Divested sales includes the exit of our non-core products through sale and through the discontinuation of product lines. Management believes reporting organic sales growth provides useful information to investors, potential investors and others, because it allows for a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. We reconcile the change in organic sales to our reported sales for each region within our results below.\nIn December 2017, we concluded our transformation program relating to our Americas and APMEA businesses, which primarily involved the exit and discontinuation of low-margin, non-core product lines, enhancing global sourcing capabilities and the reduction of the square footage of our Americas facilities. The transformation program was approved by our Board of Directors in 2015. Over the course of the program, we eliminated approximately $165 million of the combined Americas and APMEA net sales, primarily within our do-it-yourself (DIY) distribution channel. As part of the exit of non-core product lines, we entered into an agreement to sell an operating subsidiary in China that was dedicated exclusively to the manufacturing of products being discontinued. The sale was finalized in the second quarter of 2016, and we recognized a pre-tax gain of $8.7 million and received proceeds from the sale of $8.4 million. The program also involved the consolidation of manufacturing facilities and distribution center network optimization, reducing the square footage of our Americas facilities net operating footprint by approximately 30%. The footprint focus of the program was designed to improve the utilization of our remaining facilities, better leverage our cost structure, reduce working capital, and improve execution of customer delivery requirements.\nThe total pre-tax cost for our transformation program related to our Americas and APMEA businesses was $59.8 million, including restructuring costs of $18.1 million, goodwill and intangible asset impairments of $13.5 million and other transformation and deployment costs of approximately $28.3 million. The other transformation and deployment costs included consulting and project management fees, inventory write-offs, and other associated costs. The program originally included estimated pre-tax charges totaling approximately $65 million. In the third quarter of 2017, the total expected costs of the planned actions were reduced to approximately $60 million, primarily related to reduced expected facility exit costs and reduced other transformation and deployment costs. All costs associated with the Americas and APMEA transformation program were incurred as of December 31, 2017. Refer to Note 3 and Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nAcquisitions and Disposals\nOn November 2, 2016, we acquired 100% of the shares of PVI Riverside Holdings, Inc., the parent company of PVI. The aggregate purchase price, including the final working capital adjustment, was approximately $79.1 million. PVI is a leading manufacturer of commercial stainless steel water heating equipment, focused on the high capacity market in North America and is based in Fort Worth, Texas. PVI's water heater product offering complements AERCO's boiler products, allowing us to address customers' heating and hot water requirements.\nOn February 26, 2016, we acquired an additional 50% of the outstanding shares of Watts Korea for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $4 million. Prior to February 26, 2016, the Company held a 40% interest in Watts Korea, which operated as a joint venture. We acquired the remaining 10% ownership in the fourth quarter of 2016 and now own 100% of Watts Korea. Watts Korea strengthens our strategic vision to expand solutions sales into the Korean market. We accounted for the transaction as a step acquisition within a business combination. We recognized a $1.7 million pre-tax gain on the previously held 40% ownership interest in the first quarter of 2016.\nOn September 22, 2015, we signed an agreement to sell an operating subsidiary in China that was dedicated to the production of non-core products. The sale was finalized in the second quarter of 2016, and we received total proceeds of approximately $8.4 million from the sale as of the fourth quarter of 2016. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $8.7 million, which includes a non-cash accumulated currency translation adjustment of $7.3 million. The net after-tax gain was approximately $8.3 million.\nOn November 30, 2015, we acquired 80% of the outstanding shares of Apex Valves Limited ( Apex\u201d). Apex specializes in the design and manufacturing of control valves for low and high pressure hot water and filtration systems. Apex also produces an extensive range of float and reservoir valves for the agricultural industry. The aggregate purchase price was approximately $20.4 million and we recorded a long-term liability of $5.5 million as the estimate of the acquisition date fair value on the contractual call option to purchase the remaining 20% within three years of closing. Apex manufactures high-end valves for the New Zealand market that we believe could be introduced in the China market and other countries in South East Asia. We acquired an additional 10% ownership in the first quarter of 2017 for approximately $2.9 million and now own 90% of the outstanding shares of Apex. We maintain a current liability of approximately $2.9 million for the estimated fair value on the remaining 10% contractual call option, which is expected to be exercised in 2018.\nRecent Developments\nOn February 8, 2018, we declared a quarterly dividend of nineteen cents ($0.19) per share on each outstanding share of Class A common stock and Class B common stock payable on March 16, 2018 to stockholders of record on March 2, 2018.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nNet Sales.

The product rationalization mainly affected our DIY and OEM channels.\nOrganic net sales in the Americas increased $7.4 million mainly from growth in the wholesale channel, driven by valve, HVAC, and drainage products. This increase was partially offset by declines in the specialty channels, where we experienced weakness in our tankless water heater and condensing boiler products. There was also a decrease in the DIY channel due to the product rationalization discussed above.\nOrganic net sales in Europe increased $2.5 million primarily due to growth in the wholesale channel from increased sales of our drains products. This increase was also due to higher demand for our electronics products in Germany. These increases were partially offset by product rationalization and reduced demand for our HVAC products in Italy.\nOrganic net sales in APMEA decreased $2.9 million driven primarily by the impact of product rationalization. This decrease was offset partly by higher demand in China for our residential underfloor heating products and commercial valves products, as well as growth in South Korea from an expanded product offering.\nThe net increase in sales due to foreign exchange was primarily due to the appreciation of the euro and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar in 2017. We cannot predict whether foreign currencies will appreciate or depreciate against the U.S. dollar in future periods or whether future foreign exchange rate fluctuations will have a positive or negative impact on our net sales.\nThe decrease in total net sales due to divested products of $3.5 million relates to the discontinuation of product lines we divested by the end of the first quarter of 2016 in the Americas segment as part of our Americas transformation program.\nThe increase in net sales from acquisitions in the Americas and APMEA segments are related to the fourth quarter 2016 acquisition of PVI and the first quarter 2016 acquisition of Watts Korea, respectively.\nGross Profit. Gross profit and gross profit as a percent of net sales (gross margin) for 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\nTable 54: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n602.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n565.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n41.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n40.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in gross margin percentage is attributable to increased volume, manufacturing productivity, changes to our product mix, and incremental savings from our transformation and restructuring programs primarily within the Americas and Europe.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses increased $8.2 million, or 1.9%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase in SG&A expenses was attributable to the following:\nTable 55: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOrganic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(7.3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.7)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nForeign exchange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAcquisition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSG&A expenses increased primarily as a result of our 2016 acquisitions of PVI and Watts Korea, as well as increases in foreign exchange primarily from the appreciation of the euro and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar compared to 2016. Organically SG&A expenses decreased $7.3 million compared to 2016, primarily related to a decline in product liability costs of $9.4 million, lower transformation costs of $8.1 million as we completed our transformation program in 2017, and lower property tax and other tax charges of $1.1 million. The decline in product liability costs was primarily due to the resolution of the class action lawsuits related to certain legacy claims for undifferentiated products which we have exited, and the associated reduction in reported claims. The organic decrease was partially offset by $8.2 million for investments in strategic initiatives, which includes $2.5 million in research and development costs, and$4.2 million of higher distribution and freight costs. Total SG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 29.7% in 2017 compared to 30.3% in 2016.\nRestructuring. In 2017, we recorded a net charge of $6.8 million, primarily for the transformation of our Americas business, involuntary terminations and other costs incurred as part of our restructuring initiatives, as compared to a net charge of $4.7 million in 2016. For a more detailed description of our current restructuring plans, see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report Form 10-K.\nGoodwill and Other Long-Lived Asset Impairment Charges. In 2017, we recorded an impairment of $1.0 million, primarily related to a technology asset in the Americas operating segment. In 2016, we recorded impairment charges of $0.5 million, primarily related to an indefinite lived tradename in the Europe operating segment. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these impairments.\nGain on disposition. In the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $8.7 million related to the sale of a China subsidiary that was dedicated to the production of non-core products and part of the transformation of our Americas and APMEA businesses. The pre-tax gain included a non-cash accumulated currency translation adjustment of $7.3 million.\nOperating Income (Loss).

in the Americas, as well as savings from our restructuring initiatives in Europe. The increase in operating income was also driven by reduced transformation costs compared to 2016 in the Americas and APMEA as our transformation program was completed in 2017. Contributing to the increase in consolidated operating income was $2.9 million from the acquisition of PVI. Included in operating income in 2016 was an $8.7 million gain on a disposition of a China subsidiary.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense decreased $3.5 million, or 15.5%, in 2017 from 2016 as we repaid over $150 million in outstanding debt during 2017. Further, our weighted average interest rate decreased marginally year to year as we retired higher cost private placement debt in the middle of 2016 and replaced with lower cost revolver debt and we replaced certain U.S. based revolver debt with lower cost euro denominated debt in late 2016. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nOther expense (income), net. Other expense (income), net, decreased $5.5 million to a net expense balance of $1.1 million in 2017 as compared to a net other income balance of ($4.4) million in 2016. Included in other income in 2016 was a $1.7 million non-cash gain recognized on the acquisition of Watts Korea. The remaining decrease is primarily due to net foreign currency transaction losses in 2017.\nIncome Taxes. Our effective income tax rate changed to 48.9% in 2017, from 34.1% in 2016. The tax rate increased primarily due to the impact of the 2017 Tax Act, which was enacted on December 22, 2017, and has resulted in significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system. These changes include lowering the corporate tax rate from\n35% to 21% in 2018, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time deemed repatriation toll tax on cumulative undistributed foreign earnings.\nChanges in tax rates and tax laws are accounted for in the period of enactment and deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the enacted tax rate. Therefore, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a provisional charge of $25.1 million related to our current estimate of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act, including an estimated $23.3 million expense under the Toll Tax. The Toll Tax will be paid over an eight-year period, starting in 2018, and will not accrue interest.\nNet Income (Loss). Net income for 2017 was $73.1 million, or $2.12 per common share, compared to $84.2 million, or $2.44 per common share, for 2016. Results for 2017 include a charge of $25.1 million within income tax expense, or $0.73 per common share, related to the impact of the 2017 Tax Act, $1.9 million, or $0.06 per common share, for the Europe and Americas transformation costs; $4.7 million, or $0.14 per common share, for restructuring charges; $0.6 million, or $0.02 per common share for long-lived asset impairment charges, partially offset by $1.6 million or $0.05 per common share in tax benefits.\nResults for 2016 include after-tax benefits of $8.3 million, or $0.24 per common share, for a gain on disposition and $1.0 million, or $0.03 per common share, for a gain on acquisition of Watts Korea, offset by an after-tax charge of $8.8 million, or $0.26 per common share, for the Europe and Americas transformation deployment costs; $3.2 million, or $0.09 per common share, for restructuring charges; $1.3 million, or $0.04 per common share for purchase accounting adjustments related to our acquisitions in 2016; $1.2 million, or $0.03 per common share for acquisition costs in 2016; and $2.6 million, or $0.08 per common share for other items, primarily related to tax charges related to the transformation.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nNet Sales.

These increases were partially offset by declines in the OEM boiler market in Germany, sales declines in France, and by project delays in our drains business partly driven by the impact of economic and political uncertainty in the UK.\nOrganic net sales in the APMEA wholesale market increased as compared to 2015 primarily due to strong demand for our underfloor heating products for residential applications as well as for our water and plumbing products outside of China.\nThe net decrease in sales due to foreign exchange was primarily due to the depreciation of the euro, Chinese yuan and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar in 2016. We cannot predict whether foreign currencies will appreciate or depreciate against the U.S. dollar in future periods or whether future foreign exchange rate fluctuations will have a positive or negative impact on our net sales.\nThe decrease in total net sales due to divested products of $98.0 million was a result of the exit of our low margin, non-core products beginning after the first quarter 2015 in our Americas and APMEA segments. Divested sales included the exit of our non-core products through sale and through the discontinuation of product lines.\nThe increase in net sales from acquisitions in APMEA was related to the fourth quarter 2015 acquisition of Apex and the first quarter 2016 acquisition of Watts Korea. The increase in net sales from acquisitions in the Americas was related to the acquisition of PVI in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nGross Profit. Gross profit and gross profit as a percent of net sales (gross margin) for 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n565.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n553.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n40.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n37.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmericas' gross margin percentage increased compared to 2015 due primarily to a favorable product mix, including the 2015 exit of our low-margin, non-core product lines, as well as manufacturing efficiencies and commodity cost savings. Europe's gross margin percentage increased marginally due to manufacturing productivity, restructuring savings and commodity cost savings, compared to 2015. APMEA's gross margin percentage increased compared to 2015 primarily due to increased trade sales and product mix, offset by the decreased intercompany activity.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses decreased $67.2 million, or 13.7%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in SG&A expenses was attributable to the following:\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOrganic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(72.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(14.8)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nForeign exchange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0.4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAcquisitions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(67.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(13.7)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe organic decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily due to the 2015 settlement of certain long-term obligations, including our pension plan and supplemental employee retirement plan obligations of $64.7 million and a $6.0 million charge incurred in 2015 to settle legacy product liability claims. Product liability expense decreased $2.8 million in 2016 compared to 2015 due to a reduction in the frequency of reported claims. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in stock compensation expense of $2.5 million in 2016 compared to 2015 mainly due to a change in timing of our 2016 grants, which were granted earlier in 2016 than in 2015. SG&A expenses from acquisitions related to the Apex, Watts Korea, and PVI acquisitions. Total SG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 30.3% in 2016 compared to 33.5% in 2015.\nRestructuring. In 2016, we recorded a net charge of $4.7 million primarily for the transformation of our Americas and APMEA businesses and involuntary terminations and other costs incurred as part of our Europe restructuring plans, as compared to $21.4 million in 2015. For a more detailed description of our current restructuring plans, see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGoodwill and Other Long-Lived Asset Impairment Charges. In 2016, we recorded impairment charges of $0.5 million, primarily related to an indefinite lived tradename in the Europe reporting unit. In 2015, we recorded impairment charges of $130.5 million, primarily relating to a $129.7 million goodwill impairment charge in the Europe reporting unit. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these impairments.\nGain on disposition. In the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $8.7 million related to the sale of a China subsidiary that was dedicated to the production of non-core products and part of the transformation of our Americas and APMEA businesses. The pre-tax gain included a non-cash accumulated currency translation adjustment of $7.3 million.\nOperating Income (loss).

</tr>\n</table>\nOperating income in 2016 of $145.0 million increased by $235.1 million compared to 2015. This increase is primarily related to the $129.7 million goodwill impairment charge in the Europe reporting unit, the 2015 settlement charge of $64.7 million for certain long-term obligations, including our pension plan and supplemental employee retirement plan, $16.7 million less in restructuring costs recognized in 2016 compared to 2015, as well as the $6.0 million charge to settle legacy product liability claims in 2015. We also recognized a gain of $8.7 million in the second quarter of 2016 on the disposition of a subsidiary in China. The remaining $9.3 million increase was due to favorable sales mix, favorable sourcing, and productivity.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense decreased $1.7 million, or 7%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to the retirement in April 2016 of a $225 million higher interest bearing private placement note that was replaced by $230 million drawn on our line of credit. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nOther income, net. Other income, net, increased $2.0 million to an income balance of $4.4 million in 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to the $1.7 million non-cash gain recognized on the acquisition of Watts Korea in the first quarter of 2016. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details on the acquisition. The remaining increase is due to net foreign currency transaction gains in 2016 as a result of the depreciation of the euro and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar in 2016 compared to 2015.\nIncome Taxes. Our effective income tax rate changed to 34.1% in 2016, from (1.7%) in 2015. The significant change in the tax rate was due to the impact that the non-deductible and other income tax reserve items had on a loss before income taxes reported in 2015, primarily related to the goodwill impairment charge and the settlement of our pension plan and supplemental employee retirement plan obligations.\nNet Income (loss). Net income was $84.2 million, or $2.45 per common share, compared to a net loss of ($112.9) million, or ($3.24) per common share, for 2015. Results for 2016 include after-tax benefits for a gain on disposition of $8.3 million, or $0.24 per common share, and $1.0 million, or $0.03 per common share, for a gain on acquisition of Watts Korea, offset by an after-tax charge of $8.8 million, or $0.26 per common share, for the Europe and Americas transformation deployment costs; $3.2 million, or $0.09 per common share, for restructuring charges; $1.3 million, or $0.04 per common share for purchase accounting adjustments related to our acquisitions in 2016; $1.2 million, or $0.03 per common share for acquisition costs in 2016; and $2.6 million, or $0.08 per common share for other items, primarily related to tax charges related to the transformation.\nResults for 2015 include an after-tax charge of $126.8 million, or $3.63 per common share, for goodwill and other long-lived asset impairment charges; $44.6 million, or $1.28 per common share, for long-term obligation settlements including pension obligations; $13.9 million, or $0.40 per common share, for restructuring; $9.0 million, or $0.26 per common share, for the Europe and Americas transformation deployment costs; $3.7 million, or $0.11 per common share, for legal and other settlements; and $0.9 million, or $0.03 per common share, for acquisition related costs.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n2017 Cash Flows\nWe generated $155.9 million of net cash from operating activities in 2017 as compared to $138.1 million of net cash generated from operating activities in 2016. The increase was primarily related to higher net income after excluding the non-cash effect of the 2017 Tax Act and the impact of non-cash adjustments, partially offset by the timing of working capital fluctuations compared to 2016. We generated $126.9 million of free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure, which we reconcile below, defined as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures plus proceeds from sale of assets), compared to free cash flow of $102.2 million in 2016.\nWe used $27.3 million of net cash for investing activities in 2017 compared to $114.0 million in 2016. We used $88.1 million less cash in 2017 for acquisitions as 2016 included the acquisition of PVI and Watts Korea. We used $6.6 million less cash for purchases of capital equipment compared to 2016. The decrease in cash used for investing activities was partially offset by a $1.5 million purchase of additional intangible assets, and $6.8 million less cash generated from the sale of assets in 2017. We anticipate investing between $36 million to $40 million in capital equipment in 2018 to improve our manufacturing capabilities.\nWe used $205.3 million of net cash from financing activities in 2017 primarily due to payments of long-term debt of $178.0 million, dividend payments of $25.9 million, and payments to repurchase approximately 278,000 shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $18.2 million. This was partially offset by proceeds from an additional draw on our line of credit of $20.0 million during 2017.\nOn February 12, 2016, we terminated our prior Credit Agreement and entered into a new Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company who became borrowers under the Credit Agreement, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and Letter of Credit Issuer, and the other lenders referred to therein. The Credit Agreement provides for a $500 million, five-year, senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) with a sublimit of up to $100 million in letters of credit. The Credit Agreement also provided for a $300 million, five-year, term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility\u201d) available to us in a single draw. The Credit Agreement matures on February 12, 2021, subject to extension under certain circumstances and subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2017, we had $277.5 million of borrowings outstanding on the term loan and $147.0 million drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility; had $25.7 million of stand-by letters of credit outstanding and had $327.3 million of unused and available credit under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants related to the Credit Agreement.\nOn December 16, 2016, Watts International Holdings Limited ( Watts International\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Facility Agreement (the Facility Agreement\u201d) among Watts International, as original borrower and original guarantor, Watts Water Technologies EMEA B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ( Watts EMEA\u201d), as original guarantor, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as sole bookrunner and sole lead arranger ( JP Morgan Chase Bank\u201d), J.P. Morgan Europe Limited, as agent to the financial parties, and the other lenders referred to therein. The Facility Agreement provides for a \u20ac110 million, 364 day, term loan facility available to the Company in a single draw. On December 20, 2016, Watts International borrowed the full amount available for borrowing under the Facility Agreement. The loan made on December 20, 2016 bears interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) the Euro InterBank Offered Rate (EURIBOR), provided that if such rate is less than zero, then EURIBOR shall be deemed to be zero, plus (ii) a margin of 1.875%, provided that if no event of default is continuing and Watts International's consolidated leverage ratio is at a specified level, the margin shall decrease to 1.50%. Accrued interest on the loan is payable on the last day of each interest period. The first interest period is set at one month and may be changed subsequently to a period of one, two, or three months (or such other period agreed with all the lenders). Substantially all of the proceeds of the borrowings made on December 20, 2016 under the Facility Agreement were used to pay down $113 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of the third quarter of 2017, the Company had repaid in full the Facility Agreement.\nWe have historically financed our operating and capital needs primarily through cash flows generated by our operations. We expect to continue funding future operating requirements principally through our cash flows from operations, in addition to existing cash resources. We believe that our existing funds, when combined with cash generated from operations and our ability to access additional financing resources, if needed, are sufficient to satisfy our operating, working capital, strategic initiatives, capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future. In\naddition, we may choose to opportunistically return cash to shareholders and pursue other business initiatives, including acquisition activities. We may, from time to time, also seek additional funding through a combination of equity and debt financings should we identify a significant new opportunity.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we held $280.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. Of this amount, $259.3 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2017, we considered none of our earnings to be permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. Previously, earnings of foreign subsidiaries were only subject to U.S. income tax upon repatriation to the U.S. However, the 2017 Tax Act, requires us to pay a one-time deemed repatriation toll charge on cumulative undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not previously provided U.S. taxes. Cumulative earnings in the form of cash and cash equivalents, as defined in the 2017 Tax Act, will be taxed at a rate of 15.5% and all other earnings will be taxed at a rate of 8.0%. We estimate that our obligation associated with this one-time deemed repatriation toll charge to be $23.3 million, which will be paid in installments over eight years. We can repatriate cumulative undistributed foreign earnings back to the U.S. when needed and have recorded provisional charges of $14.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 related to future repatriation of earnings. Over the next twelve months we expect to repatriate approximately $125 million of cash back to the U.S. We are currently evaluating all potential uses for the cash in the U.S., with debt reduction expected to be a priority.\nCovenant compliance\nUnder the Credit Agreement, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios and other financial condition tests as of December 31, 2017. The financial ratios included a consolidated interest coverage ratio based on consolidated earnings before income taxes, interest expense, depreciation, and amortization (Consolidated EBITDA) to consolidated interest expense, as defined in the Credit Agreement. Our Credit Agreement defined Consolidated EBITDA to exclude unusual or non-recurring charges and gains. We were also required to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of consolidated funded debt to Consolidated EBITDA. Consolidated funded debt, as defined in the Credit Agreement, included all long and short-term debt, capital lease obligations and any trade letters of credit that are outstanding, less cash on the balance sheet that exceeded $50 million.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our actual financial ratios calculated in accordance with our Credit Agreement compared to the required levels under the Credit Agreement were as follows:\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nActual Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRequired Level\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMinimum level\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest Charge Coverage Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12.49 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.50 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMaximum level\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLeverage Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.12 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.25 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants related to the Credit Agreement.\nWe have one senior note agreement as further detailed in Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report Form 10-K. This senior note agreement requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of consolidated EBITDA plus consolidated rent expense during the period to consolidated fixed charges. Consolidated fixed charges are the sum of consolidated interest expense for the period and consolidated rent expense.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our actual fixed charge coverage ratio calculated in accordance with our senior note agreements compared to the required ratio therein was as follows:\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nActual Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRequired Level\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMinimum level\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFixed Charge Coverage Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.03 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.00 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to financial ratios, the Credit Agreement and senior note agreement contain affirmative and negative covenants that include limitations on disposition or sale of assets, prohibitions on assuming or incurring any liens on assets with limited exceptions and limitations on making investments other than those permitted by the agreements.\nWorking capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) as of December 31, 2017 was $456.2 million compared to $393.9 million as of December 31, 2016. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.4 to 1 as of December 31, 2017 compared to 1.9 to 1 as of December 31, 2016. The increase in working capital is primarily related to more cash generated from operations, as well as less cash used for purchases of capital equipment and repurchases of common stock in 2017.\n2016 Cash Flows\nIn 2016, we generated $138.1 million of cash from operating activities as compared to $109.4 million in 2015. Cash flows from operating activities in 2015 included a $49.2 million settlement of certain long-term obligations, including pension obligations. We generated approximately $102.2 million of free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure, which we reconcile below, defined as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures plus proceeds from sale of assets), compared to free cash flow of $81.8 million in 2015.\nIn 2016, we used $114.0 million of net cash for investing activities compared to $17.3 million in 2015. We used $67.6 million more cash in 2016 than 2015 relating to the acquisitions of PVI and Watts Korea. We also increased our purchases of capital equipment during 2016 by $8.3 million. In 2015, we received approximately $20.8 million more in cash proceeds from the sale of assets, primarily relating to the sale of non-core product lines in the Americas.\nIn 2016, we generated $27.7 million of net cash from financing activities as compared to $70.9 million of net cash used in 2015. The increase in cash generated is primarily due to net proceeds from long-term borrowings of $74.4 million and $17.8 million less in stock repurchases in 2016. We also received an additional $5.7 million in cash proceeds from share transactions under employee stock plans in 2016 compared to 2015.\n2015 Cash Flows\nIn 2015, we generated $109.4 million of cash from operating activities as compared to $135.2 million in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the $49.2 million settlement of certain long-term obligations, including the pension plan, offset by inventory reduction efforts and stronger accounts receivable collections. We generated approximately $81.8 million of free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure, which we reconcile below, defined as net cash provided by continuing operating activities minus capital expenditures plus proceeds from sale of assets).\nIn 2015, we used $17.3 million of net cash for investing activities, including $20.4 million for the purchase of Apex and $27.7 million of cash for capital equipment, offset by cash proceeds of approximately $33.1 million for the sale of certain assets relating to divested product lines in the Americas.\nIn 2015, we used $70.9 million of net cash from financing activities including $44.6 million used to repurchase approximately 813,000 shares of Class A common stock and $23.1 million used to pay dividends.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn accordance with the SEC's Regulation G and item 10(e) of Regulation S-K, the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures used by management. We believe that these measures provide for a more complete perspective of underlying business results and trends. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measure, but rather as supplemental information to more fully understand our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted.\nOrganic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth that excludes the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from period-over-period comparisons. A reconciliation to the most closely related U.S.GAAP measure, net sales, has been included in our discussion within Results of Operations\u201d above. Organic net sales should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to net sales. Management believes reporting organic sales growth provides useful information to investors, potential investors and others, by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods.\nAdjusted operating income, adjusted operating margins, adjusted net income, and adjusted earnings per share are non-GAAP measures that exclude certain expenses that relate primarily to our global restructuring programs, deployment\ncosts, acquisition related costs, purchase accounting adjustments, gains on acquisition and disposition, goodwill and other long-lived asset impairments, certain other costs and the related income tax impacts on these items and other tax adjustments, including the impact of the 2017 Tax Act. Management believes reporting these financial measures provides useful information to investors, potential investors and others, by facilitating easier comparisons of our performance with prior and future periods.\nA reconciliation of U.S. GAAP results to these adjusted non-GAAP measures is provided below:\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,456.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,398.4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating income -

Therefore it should not be considered an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities as an indication of our performance. The cash conversion rate of free cash flow to net income is also a measure of our performance in cash flow generation. We believe free cash flow to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating performance because it provides investors with a measure of our ability to generate cash, repay debt, pay dividends, repurchase stock and fund acquisitions.\nA reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow and calculation of our cash conversion rate is provided below:\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n155.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n138.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n109.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLess: additions to property, plant, and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(29.4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(36.0)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(27.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPlus: proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFree cash flow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n126.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n102.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n81.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income (loss)-as reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n73.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n84.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(112.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash conversion rate of free cash flow to net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n173.6\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n121.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNM\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFree cash flow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n126.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n102.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n81.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPlus: payments made on long-term obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n49.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFree cash flow-as adjusted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n126.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n102.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n131.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur free cash flow increased in 2017 when compared to the free cash flow for 2016 primarily due to an increase in cash flows provided by operations and lower capital investment spending in 2017, partially offset by the timing of working capital fluctuations compared to 2016.\nOur net debt to capitalization ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure used by management, decreased to 20.7% for 2017 from 29.8% in 2016. The decrease was driven by a decrease in net debt outstanding at December 31, 2017, primarily due to the full repayment of the Facility Agreement during the third quarter of 2017. Management believes the net debt to capitalization ratio is an appropriate supplemental measure because it helps investors understand our ability to meet our financing needs and serves as a basis to evaluate our financial structure. Our computation may not be comparable to other companies that may define their net debt to capitalization ratios differently.\nA reconciliation of long-term debt (including current portion) to net

Amounts outstanding were approximately $25.7 million as of December 31, 2017 and $25.6 million as of December 31, 2016. Our letters of credit are primarily associated with insurance coverage and, to a lesser extent, foreign purchases and generally expire within one year of issuance. These instruments may exist or expire without being drawn down; therefore they do not necessarily represent future cash flow obligations and are not included in the table above.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nExcept for operating lease commitments, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and Key Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. A critical accounting estimate is an assumption about highly uncertain matters and could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements if another, also reasonable, amount were used, or, a change in the estimate is reasonably likely from period to period. We base our assumptions on historical experience and on other estimates that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. There were no significant changes in our accounting policies or significant changes in our accounting estimates during 2017.\nWe periodically discuss the development, selection and disclosure of the estimates with our Audit Committee. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions.\nRevenue recognition\nWe recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: (1) we have entered into a binding agreement, (2) the product has shipped and title has passed, (3) the sales price to the customer is fixed or is determinable and\n(4) collectability is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue based upon a determination that all criteria for revenue recognition have been met, which, based on the majority of our shipping terms, is considered to have occurred upon shipment of the finished product. Some shipping terms require the goods to be received by the customer before title passes. In those instances, revenues are not recognized until the customer has received the goods. We record estimated reductions to revenue and a corresponding asset for customer returns and allowances and for customer programs. Provisions for returns and allowances are made at the time of sale, derived from historical trends and form a portion of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Customer programs, which are primarily annual volume incentive plans, allow customers to earn credit for attaining agreed upon purchase targets from us. We record estimated reductions to revenue, made at the time of sale, for customer programs based on estimated purchase targets.\nInventory valuation\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with costs determined primarily on a first-in first-out basis. We utilize both specific product identification and historical product demand as the basis for determining our excess or obsolete inventory reserve. We identify all inventories that exceed a range of one to three years in sales. This is determined by comparing the current inventory balance against unit sales for the trailing twelve months. New products added to inventory within the past twelve months are excluded from this analysis. A portion of our products contain recoverable materials, therefore the excess and obsolete reserve is established net of any recoverable amounts. Changes in market conditions, lower-than- expected customer demand or changes in technology or features could result in additional obsolete inventory that is not saleable and could require additional inventory reserve provisions.\nIn certain countries, additional inventory reserves are maintained for potential shrinkage experienced in the manufacturing process. The reserve is established based on the prior year's inventory losses adjusted for any change in the gross inventory balance.\nGoodwill and other intangibles\nWe have made numerous acquisitions over the years and have recognized a significant amount of goodwill. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using an income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, and when appropriate, guideline public company and guideline transaction market approaches.\nAccounting guidance allows us to review goodwill for impairment utilizing either qualitative or quantitative analyses. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then performing the quantitative impairment test is unnecessary.\nWe first identify those reporting units that we believe could pass a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. For each reporting unit identified, our qualitative analysis includes:\nTable 75: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nA review of the most recent fair value calculation to identify the extent of the cushion between fair value and carrying amount, to determine if a substantial cushion existed.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nA review of events and circumstances that have occurred since the most recent fair value calculation to determine if those events or circumstances would have affected our previous fair value assessment. Items identified and reviewed include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market changes, cost factor changes, events that affect the reporting unit, and financial performance against expectations and the reporting unit's performance relative to peers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe then compile this information and make our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we determine it is not more likely than not, then no further quantitative analysis is required.\nIn 2017, we had eight reporting units. One of these reporting units, Water Quality, had no goodwill. We performed a qualitative analysis for six of the remaining seven reporting units, which include Bl\u00fccher, Dormont, US Drains, Europe, Residential and Commercial, and APMEA. For one reporting unit, Heating and Hot Water Solutions ( HHWS\u201d), we performed a quantitative analysis.\nAs of our October 29, 2017 testing date, we had $547.5 million of goodwill on our balance sheet. As a result of our qualitative analyses, we determined that the fair values of the six reporting units noted above were more likely than not greater than the carrying amounts. We performed a quantitative impairment analysis for the HHWS reporting unit in connection with the annual strategic plan and due to underperformance to budget, primarily caused by continuing softness in the condensing boiler market, weakness in our tankless water heater products and competitive pricing pressure. We estimated the fair value of the reporting unit using a weighted calculation of the income approach and the market approach. Inherent in our development of the fair value of the reporting unit are the assumptions and estimates used in the income, and where appropriate, market approaches. The income approach calculates the present value of future cash flow projections based on assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results, business plans, expected growth rates, the appropriate revenue and EBITDA multiples, and discount rates. We also made certain assumptions about future economic conditions and market data. We developed our assumptions based on our historical results, including sales growth, operating profits, working capital levels and income tax rates. The market approach calculates the estimated fair value based on valuation multiples derived from stock prices and enterprise values of publicly traded companies that are comparable to the reporting unit and based on valuation multiples are derived from actual transactions for comparable public companies when appropriate.\nWe believe that the income approach is sensitive to the selected discount rate and the market approach is sensitive to valuation multiples used. We use third-party valuation specialists to help develop the appropriate discount rate and valuation multiples. We use standard valuation practices to arrive at a weighted average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d) based on the market and guideline public companies. The higher the discount rate, the lower the discounted cash flows. While we believe that our estimate of future cash flows and market approach valuations are reasonable, different assumptions could significantly affect our valuation and result in impairments in the future.\nThe expected cash flows are discounted to present value using a WACC. The key assumptions used to determine the appropriate WACC rates utilized in the income approach for the HHWS reporting unit were as follows:\nTable 77: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nA risk free rate based on the 20-year U.S. Treasury Bonds as of the assessment date.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nA market risk premium that is determined, in part, through published historical studies adjusted for the business risk index for the reporting unit. The business risk index is derived from comparable companies and measures the estimated stock price volatility.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nComparable company and market interest rate information used to the determine the cost of debt and the appropriate long-term capital structure in order to weight the cost of debt and the cost of equity into an overall WACC.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nA small stock premium based on the size of the reporting unit.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the HHWS reporting unit, the underlying analyses supporting our fair value assessment are related to our comparable companies' historical and projected results, current transaction values and our outlook of our business' long-term performance, which included key assumptions as to the appropriate revenue and EBITDA multiples, discount rate and long-term growth rate. In connection with the HHWS impairment assessment, we utilized a discount rate of 9% and growth rates beyond our planning periods ranging from 5% to 7% and a long-term terminal growth rate of 3%. Future increases in discount rates due to changing interest rates or a declining economic environment and different market multiples could impact our assumptions and the value of our reporting units. However, taking into consideration the various elements of the 2017 Tax Act would result in a net increase to the discounted cash flows generated by the reporting unit in our strategic plan, which would increase the fair value of the reporting unit.\nThe estimated fair value of the reporting unit of $397.0 million exceeded the carrying value of $373.8 million by approximately $23.2 million, or 6%, in 2017 and therefore, no impairment was recorded.\nIn 2015, we recognized a pre-tax impairment charge of $129.7 million in the Europe reporting unit. The remaining goodwill balance as of December 31, 2015 in this reporting unit was $46.4 million.\nIntangible assets such as trademarks and trade names are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition. Values assigned to intangible assets are determined by an independent valuation firm based on our estimates and judgments regarding expectations of the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. Accounting guidance allows us to perform a qualitative impairment assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets consistent with the goodwill guidance noted previously. For our 2017 impairment assessment, which occurred as of October 29, 2017, we performed quantitative assessments for all indefinite-lived intangible assets. The methodology we employed was the relief from royalty method, a subset of the income approach. During 2017, no impairment was recognized on our indefinite-lived intangible assets. In 2016, we recognized a non-cash pre-tax charge of approximately $0.4 million related to an indefinite lived tradename in our Europe reporting unit. In 2015, we recognized a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $0.6 million of certain of our indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nProduct liability\nBecause of retention requirements associated with our insurance policies, we are generally self-insured for potential product liability claims. We are subject to a variety of potential liabilities in connection with product liability cases and we maintain a high self-insured retention limit within our product liability and general liability coverage, which we believe to be generally in accordance with industry practices. For product liability cases in the U.S., management establishes its product liability accrual, which includes legal costs associated with accrued claims, by utilizing third-party actuarial valuations which incorporate historical trend factors and our specific claims experience derived from loss reports provided by third-party administrators. The product liability accrual is established after considering any applicable insurance coverage. Changes in the nature of product liability claims, legal costs, or the actual settlement amounts could affect the adequacy of the estimates and require changes to the accrual. Because the liability is an estimate, the ultimate liability may be more or less than reported.\nWe determine the trend factors for product liability based on consultation with outside actuaries. We maintain excess liability insurance to minimize our risks related to claims in excess of our primary insurance policies. Any material change in the aforementioned factors could have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nLegal contingencies\nWe are a defendant in numerous legal matters including those involving environmental issues and product liability as discussed in more detail in Part I, Item 1. Business-Product Liability, Environmental and Other Litigation Matters.\u201d As required by GAAP, we determine whether an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and the loss amount can be reasonably estimated. When it is possible to estimate reasonably possible loss or range of loss above the amount accrued, that estimate is aggregated and disclosed. Estimates of potential outcomes of these contingencies are often developed in consultation with outside counsel. While this assessment is based upon all available information, litigation is inherently uncertain and the actual liability to fully resolve litigation cannot be predicted with any assurance of accuracy. In the event of an unfavorable outcome in one or more legal matters, the ultimate liability may be in excess of amounts currently accrued, if any, and may be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular quarterly or annual period. However, based on information currently known to us, management believes that the ultimate outcome of all legal contingencies, as they are resolved over time, is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, though the outcome could be material to our operating results for any particular period depending, in part, upon the operating results for such period.\nIncome taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions, determining our provision for income taxes, and evaluating the impact of the 2017 Tax Act.\nWe estimate and use our expected annual effective income tax rates to accrue income taxes. Effective tax rates are determined based on budgeted earnings before taxes, including our best estimate of permanent items that will affect the effective rate for the year. Management periodically reviews these rates with outside tax advisors and changes are made if material variances from expectations are identified.\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nA valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We consider estimated future taxable income and future reversals of the deferred tax liabilities in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\nThe 2017 Tax Act was enacted on December 22, 2017 and introduces significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effective in 2018, the 2017 Tax Act reduces the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings and certain related-party payments, which are referred to as the global intangible low-taxed income tax and the base erosion tax, respectively. In addition, in 2017 we are subject to the Toll Tax, a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax. Accounting for the income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act requires significant judgments and estimates in the interpretation and calculations of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act.\nWe are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as determining the Toll Tax, remeasuring our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act, we have made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 118), which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. As we collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS or other standard-setting bodies, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts. Those adjustments may materially impact the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period or periods in which the adjustments are made. The accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act will be completed in 2018.\nNew Accounting Standards\nA discussion of recent accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "item_7_truncated": "Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.

Therefore it should not be considered an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities as an indication of our performance. The cash conversion rate of free cash flow to net income is also a measure of our performance in cash flow generation. We believe free cash flow to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating performance because it provides investors with a measure of our ability to generate cash, repay debt, pay dividends, repurchase stock and fund acquisitions.\nOur innovation strategy is focused on differentiated products that provide greater opportunity to distinguish ourselves in the market place.

we concluded our transformation program relating to our Americas and APMEA businesses, which primarily involved the exit and discontinuation of low-margin, non-core product lines, enhancing global sourcing capabilities and the reduction of the square footage of our Americas facilities. The transformation program was approved by our Board of Directors in 2015. Over the course of the program, we eliminated approximately $165 million of the combined Americas and APMEA net sales, primarily within our do-it-yourself (DIY) distribution channel. As part of the exit of non-core product lines, we entered into an agreement to sell an operating subsidiary in China that was dedicated exclusively to the manufacturing of products being discontinued. The sale was finalized in the second quarter of 2016, and we recognized a pre-tax gain of $8.7 million and received proceeds from the sale of $8.4 million. The program also involved the consolidation of manufacturing facilities and distribution center network optimization, reducing the square footage of our Americas facilities net operating footprint by approximately 30%. The footprint focus of the program was designed to improve the utilization of our remaining facilities, better leverage our cost structure, reduce working capital, and improve execution of customer delivery requirements.\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMore than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt obligations, including current maturities(a)(c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n499.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n22.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n135.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n342.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n36.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCapital lease obligations(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPension contributions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n21.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRedeemable financial instrument(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n2017 Tax Act Toll Tax payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n23.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n43.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n42.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n639.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n94.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n172.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n354.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n19.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 are presented in the following table:\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n22.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n139.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPlus: long-term debt, net of current portion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n474.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n511.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLess: cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(280.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(338.4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n216.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n312.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the HHWS reporting unit, the underlying analyses supporting our fair value assessment are related to our comparable companies' historical and projected results, current transaction values and our outlook of our business' long-term performance, which included key assumptions as to the appropriate revenue and EBITDA multiples, discount rate and long-term growth rate. In connection with the HHWS impairment assessment, we utilized a discount rate of 9% and growth rates beyond our planning periods ranging from 5% to 7% and a long-term terminal growth rate of 3%. Future increases in discount rates due to changing interest rates or a declining economic environment and different market multiples could impact our assumptions and the value of our reporting units.

Of this amount, $259.3 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2017, we considered none of our earnings to be permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. Previously, earnings of foreign subsidiaries were only subject to U.S. income tax upon repatriation to the U.S. However, the 2017 Tax Act, requires us to pay a one-time deemed repatriation toll charge on cumulative undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not previously provided U.S. taxes. Cumulative earnings in the form of cash and cash equivalents, as defined in the 2017 Tax Act, will be taxed at a rate of 15.5% and all other earnings will be taxed at a rate of 8.0%. We estimate that our obligation associated with this one-time deemed repatriation toll charge to be $23.3 million, which will be paid in installments over eight years. We can repatriate cumulative undistributed foreign earnings back to the U.S. when needed and have recorded provisional charges of $14.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 related to future repatriation of earnings. Over the next twelve months we expect to repatriate approximately $125 million of cash back to the U.S. We are currently evaluating all potential uses for the cash in the U.S., with debt reduction expected to be a priority.\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange as a %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange as a %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nof Consolidated Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nof Segment Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmericas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEurope\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAPMEA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmericas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEurope\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAPMEA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmericas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEurope\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAPMEA\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOrganic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.6\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n0.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n0.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n1.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n0.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n0.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n11.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nForeign exchange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(5.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.0)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(9.6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0.4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0.1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDivested\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(91.8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(98.0)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6.3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0.4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(9.4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(11.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAcquisitions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n24.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n28.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(77.6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(4.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n13.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(69.3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(5.3)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(0.3)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n0.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(4.7)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(7.9)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(1.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n24.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 Cash Flows\nUnder the Credit Agreement, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios and other financial condition tests as of December 31, 2017. The financial ratios included a consolidated interest coverage ratio based on consolidated earnings before income taxes, interest expense, depreciation, and amortization (Consolidated EBITDA) to consolidated interest expense, as defined in the Credit Agreement. Our Credit Agreement defined Consolidated EBITDA to exclude unusual or non-recurring charges and gains. We were also required to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of consolidated funded debt to Consolidated EBITDA. Consolidated funded debt, as defined in the Credit Agreement, included all long and short-term debt, capital lease obligations and any trade letters of credit that are outstanding, less cash on the balance sheet that exceeded $50 million.\nNet Sales.

Our net sales in each of these segments for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were as follows:\nChanges in tax rates and tax laws are accounted for in the period of enactment and deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the enacted tax rate. Therefore, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a charge totaling $25.1 million related to our current estimate of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act, including an estimated $23.3 million expense under the Toll Tax. The Toll Tax will be paid over an eight-year period, starting in 2018, and will not accrue interest. The provisions of the 2017 Tax Act allows us more flexibility in deploying our global cash resources as we continue to drive a balanced capital allocation strategy. We expect that the 2017 Tax Act will have a positive effect on our income tax rate in 2018.\nIn 2017, we successfully completed our transformation programs and realized the benefits of our product portfolio rationalization, footprint optimization, and global sourcing initiatives, while simultaneously reinvesting in the business. We continued to drive commercial and operational excellence. We completed the integration of PVI Industries, LLC ( PVI\u201d) to our portfolio during the year. We continued to streamline our product portfolio across the regions as we focus on our core product lines and rationalize certain low-margin, non-core products. Our financial performance in 2017 was solid, driven by growth in the Americas and Europe segments and realization of our productivity and transformation savings.\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n216.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n312.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal stockholders' equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n829.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n736.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCapitalization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,045.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,048.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet debt to capitalization ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n29.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSG&A expenses increased primarily as a result of our 2016 acquisitions of PVI and Watts Korea, as well as increases in foreign exchange primarily from the appreciation of the euro and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar compared to 2016. Organically SG&A expenses decreased $7.3 million compared to 2016, primarily related to a decline in product liability costs of $9.4 million, lower transformation costs of $8.1 million as we completed our transformation program in 2017, and lower property tax and other tax charges of $1.1 million. The decline in product liability costs was primarily due to the resolution of the class action lawsuits related to certain legacy claims for undifferentiated products which we have exited, and the associated reduction in reported claims. The organic decrease was partially offset by $8.2 million for investments in strategic initiatives, which includes $2.5 million in research and development costs, and$4.2 million of higher distribution and freight costs. Total SG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 29.7% in 2017 compared to 30.3% in 2016.\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange As a %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nof Prior Year Sales\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWholesale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOEMs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSpecialty\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDIY\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWholesale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOEMs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSpecialty\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDIY\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmericas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(1.3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n6.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(0.5)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n1.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEurope\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3.0)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(35.6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAPMEA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3.8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n39.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(36.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(1.3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(2.0)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nOur net debt to capitalization ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure used by management, decreased to 20.7% for 2017 from 29.8% in 2016. The decrease was driven by a decrease in net debt outstanding at December 31, 2017, primarily due to the full repayment of the Facility Agreement during the third quarter of 2017. Management believes the net debt to capitalization ratio is an appropriate supplemental measure because it helps investors understand our ability to meet our financing needs and serves as a basis to evaluate our financial structure. Our computation may not be comparable to other companies that may define their net debt to capitalization ratios differently.\nRestructuring. In 2017, we recorded a net charge of $6.8 million, primarily for the transformation of our Americas business, involuntary terminations and other costs incurred as part of our restructuring initiatives, as compared to a net charge of $4.7 million in 2016. For a more detailed description of our current restructuring plans, see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report Form 10-K.\nWe maintain letters of credit that guarantee our performance or payment to third parties in accordance with specified terms and conditions. Amounts outstanding were approximately $25.7 million as of December 31, 2017 and $25.6 million as of December 31, 2016. Our letters of credit are primarily associated with insurance coverage and, to a lesser extent, foreign purchases and generally expire within one year of issuance. These instruments may exist or expire without being drawn down; therefore they do not necessarily represent future cash flow obligations and are not included in the table above.\nResults of Operations\n\nThe estimated fair value of the reporting unit of $397.0 million exceeded the carrying value of $373.8 million by approximately $23.2 million, or 6%, in 2017 and therefore, no impairment was recorded.\nResults of Operations\nWe determine the trend factors for product liability based on consultation with outside actuaries. We maintain excess liability insurance to minimize our risks related to claims in excess of our primary insurance policies. Any material change in the aforementioned factors could have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nOur products are sold to wholesalers, OEMs, various specialty channels and DIY chains. The change in organic net sales by channel was attributable to the following:\nThe change in net sales was attributable to the following:\nOrganic net sales in APMEA decreased $2.9 million driven primarily by the impact of product rationalization. This decrease was offset partly by higher demand in China for our residential underfloor heating products and commercial valves products, as well as growth in South Korea from an expanded product offering.\nOur business is reported in three geographic segments: Americas, Europe, and APMEA. We distribute our products through four primary distribution channels: wholesale, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), specialty, and do-it-yourself (DIY). In September 2015, we divested a substantial portion of our DIY business in the Americas, which reduced the significance of DIY as a distribution channel for our products in 2017 and 2016.\nIntangible assets such as trademarks and trade names are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition. Values assigned to intangible assets are determined by an independent valuation firm based on our estimates and judgments regarding expectations of the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. Accounting guidance allows us to perform a qualitative impairment assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets consistent with the goodwill guidance noted previously. For our 2017 impairment assessment, which occurred as of October 29, 2017, we performed quantitative assessments for all indefinite-lived intangible assets. The methodology we employed was the relief from royalty method, a subset of the income approach. During 2017, no impairment was recognized on our indefinite-lived intangible assets. In 2016, we recognized a non-cash pre-tax charge of approximately $0.4 million related to an indefinite lived tradename in our Europe reporting unit. In 2015, we recognized a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $0.6 million of certain of our indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nAs of our October 29, 2017 testing date, we had $547.5 million of goodwill on our balance sheet. As a result of our qualitative analyses, we determined that the fair values of the six reporting units noted above were more likely than not greater than the carrying amounts. We performed a quantitative impairment analysis for the HHWS reporting unit in connection with the annual strategic plan and due to underperformance to budget, primarily caused by continuing softness in the condensing boiler market, weakness in our tankless water heater products and competitive pricing pressure. We estimated the fair value of the reporting unit using a weighted calculation of the income approach and the market approach. Inherent in our development of the fair value of the reporting unit are the assumptions and estimates used in the income, and where appropriate, market approaches. The income approach calculates the present value of future cash flow projections based on assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results, business plans, expected growth rates, the appropriate revenue and EBITDA multiples, and discount rates. We also made certain assumptions about future economic conditions and market data. We developed our assumptions based on our historical results, including sales growth, operating profits, working capital levels and income tax rates. The market approach calculates the estimated fair value based on valuation multiples derived from stock prices and enterprise values of publicly traded companies that are comparable to the reporting unit and based on valuation multiples are derived from actual transactions for comparable public companies when appropriate.\nLegal contingencies\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and Key Estimates\nProduct liability\nA reconciliation of capitalization is provided below:\n\nThe decrease in total net sales due to divested products of $3.5 million relates to the discontinuation of product lines we divested by the end of the first quarter of 2016 in the Americas segment as part of our Americas transformation program.\nOn November 2, 2016, we acquired 100% of the shares of PVI Riverside Holdings, Inc., the parent company of PVI. The aggregate purchase price, including the final working capital adjustment, was approximately $79.1 million. PVI is a leading manufacturer of commercial stainless steel water heating equipment, focused on the high capacity market in North America and is based in Fort Worth, Texas. PVI's water heater product offering complements AERCO's boiler products, allowing us to address customers' heating and hot water requirements.\nThe change in organic net sales as a percentage of consolidated net sales and of segment net sales in the Americas excludes divested sales for both periods presented.\nItem 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense decreased $3.5 million, or 15.5%, in 2017 from 2016 as we repaid over $150 million in outstanding debt during 2017. Further, our weighted average interest rate decreased marginally year to year as we retired higher cost private placement debt in the middle of 2016 and replaced with lower cost revolver debt and we replaced certain U.S. based revolver debt with lower cost euro denominated debt in late 2016. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nOrganic net sales in Europe increased slightly compared to 2015 mainly due to improved demand in certain key markets such as Italy, and new product introductions in our electronics platform. These increases were partially offset by declines in the OEM boiler market in Germany, sales declines in France, and by project delays in our drains business partly driven by the impact of economic and political uncertainty in the UK.\nIn 2016, we used $114.0 million of net cash for investing activities compared to $17.3 million in 2015. We used $67.6 million more cash in 2016 than 2015 relating to the acquisitions of PVI and Watts Korea. We also increased our purchases of capital equipment during 2016 by $8.3 million. In 2015, we received approximately $20.8 million more in cash proceeds from the sale of assets, primarily relating to the sale of non-core product lines in the Americas.\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\n 2) A review of events and circumstances that have occurred since the most recent fair value calculation to determine if those events or circumstances would have affected our previous fair value assessment. Items identified and reviewed include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market changes, cost factor changes, events that affect the reporting unit, and financial performance against expectations and the reporting unit's performance relative to peers. \nOur products are sold to wholesalers, OEMs, various specialty channels, and DIY chains. The change in organic net sales by channel was attributable to the following:\nNet Income (Loss). Net income for 2017 was $73.1 million, or $2.12 per common share, compared to $84.2 million, or $2.44 per common share, for 2016. Results for 2017 include a charge of $25.1 million within income tax expense, or $0.73 per common share, related to the impact of the 2017 Tax Act, $1.9 million, or $0.06 per common share, for the Europe and Americas transformation costs; $4.7 million, or $0.14 per common share, for restructuring charges; $0.6 million, or $0.02 per common share for long-lived asset impairment charges, partially offset by $1.6 million or $0.05 per common share in tax benefits.\nOn February 26, 2016, we acquired an additional 50% of the outstanding shares of Watts Korea for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $4 million. Prior to February 26, 2016, the Company held a 40% interest in Watts Korea, which operated as a joint venture. We acquired the remaining 10% ownership in the fourth quarter of 2016 and now own 100% of Watts Korea. Watts Korea strengthens our strategic vision to expand solutions sales into the Korean market. We accounted for the transaction as a step acquisition within a business combination. We recognized a $1.7 million pre-tax gain on the previously held 40% ownership interest in the first quarter of 2016.\nWe periodically discuss the development, selection and disclosure of the estimates with our Audit Committee. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses increased $8.2 million, or 1.9%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase in SG&A expenses was attributable to the following:\n \u00b7 A small stock premium based on the size of the reporting unit. \nOrganic net sales in the Americas increased $7.4 million mainly from growth in the wholesale channel, driven by valve, HVAC, and drainage products. This increase was partially offset by declines in the specialty channels, where we experienced weakness in our tankless water heater and condensing boiler products. There was also a decrease in the DIY channel due to the product rationalization discussed above.\nIncome Taxes. Our effective income tax rate changed to 48.9% in 2017, from 34.1% in 2016. The tax rate increased primarily due to the impact of the 2017 Tax Act, which was enacted on December 22, 2017, and has resulted in significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system. These changes include lowering the corporate tax rate from\nOther income, net. Other income, net, increased $2.0 million to an income balance of $4.4 million in 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to the $1.7 million non-cash gain recognized on the acquisition of Watts Korea in the first quarter of 2016. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details on the acquisition. The remaining increase is due to net foreign currency transaction gains in 2016 as a result of the depreciation of the euro and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar in 2016 compared to 2015.\nIn 2015, we recognized a pre-tax impairment charge of $129.7 million in the Europe reporting unit. The remaining goodwill balance as of December 31, 2015 in this reporting unit was $46.4 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nA reconciliation of U.S. GAAP results to these adjusted non-GAAP measures is provided below:\n \u00b7 HVAC & gas products-includes commercial high-efficiency boilers, water heaters and heating solutions, hydronic and electric heating systems for under-floor radiant applications, custom heat and hot water solutions, hydronic pump groups for boiler manufacturers and alternative energy control packages, and flexible stainless steel connectors for natural and liquid propane gas in commercial food service and residential applications. HVAC is an acronym for heating, ventilation and air conditioning. \nNet Income (loss). Net income was $84.2 million, or $2.45 per common share, compared to a net loss of ($112.9) million, or ($3.24) per common share, for 2015. Results for 2016 include after-tax benefits for a gain on disposition of $8.3 million, or $0.24 per common share, and $1.0 million, or $0.03 per common share, for a gain on acquisition of Watts Korea, offset by an after-tax charge of $8.8 million, or $0.26 per common share, for the Europe and Americas transformation deployment costs; $3.2 million, or $0.09 per common share, for restructuring charges; $1.3 million, or $0.04 per common share for purchase accounting adjustments related to our acquisitions in 2016; $1.2 million, or $0.03 per common share for acquisition costs in 2016; and $2.6 million, or $0.08 per common share for other items, primarily related to tax charges related to the transformation.\nA reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow and calculation of our cash conversion rate is provided below:\nRestructuring. In 2016, we recorded a net charge of $4.7 million primarily for the transformation of our Americas and APMEA businesses and involuntary terminations and other costs incurred as part of our Europe restructuring plans, as compared to $21.4 million in 2015. For a more detailed description of our current restructuring plans, see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. A critical accounting estimate is an assumption about highly uncertain matters and could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements if another, also reasonable, amount were used, or, a change in the estimate is reasonably likely from period to period. We base our assumptions on historical experience and on other estimates that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. There were no significant changes in our accounting policies or significant changes in our accounting estimates during 2017.\nOverview\nPrior to 2017, our Europe segment was formerly referred to as EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) and our APMEA segment was formerly referred to as Asia-Pacific. As of January 1, 2017, we began reporting the results of Watts Industries Middle East, an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary, within our APMEA segment to align with internal operating changes. These results had previously been reported within our former EMEA segment. This change does not affect our reportable segments but represents only a change in composition that better aligns with the structure of our internal organization. The 2016 and 2015 results by segment have been retrospectively revised for comparative purposes.\nIn accordance with the SEC's Regulation G and item 10(e) of Regulation S-K, the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures used by management. We believe that these measures provide for a more complete perspective of underlying business results and trends. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measure, but rather as supplemental information to more fully understand our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted.\nIncome Taxes. Our effective income tax rate changed to 34.1% in 2016, from (1.7%) in 2015. The significant change in the tax rate was due to the impact that the non-deductible and other income tax reserve items had on a loss before income taxes reported in 2015, primarily related to the goodwill impairment charge and the settlement of our pension plan and supplemental employee retirement plan obligations.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\n\nThe increase (decrease) in operating income (loss) is attributable to the following:\ncosts, acquisition related costs, purchase accounting adjustments, gains on acquisition and disposition, goodwill and other long-lived asset impairments, certain other costs and the related income tax impacts on these items and other tax adjustments, including the impact of the 2017 Tax Act. Management believes reporting these financial measures provides useful information to investors, potential investors and others, by facilitating easier comparisons of our performance with prior and future periods.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions, determining our provision for income taxes, and evaluating the impact of the 2017 Tax Act.\nAccounting guidance allows us to review goodwill for impairment utilizing either qualitative or quantitative analyses. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then performing the quantitative impairment test is unnecessary.\n (b) the majority relates to commodity and capital commitments at December 31, 2017. \n35% to 21% in 2018, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time deemed repatriation toll tax on cumulative undistributed foreign earnings.\nContractual Obligations\nThe organic decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily due to the 2015 settlement of certain long-term obligations, including our pension plan and supplemental employee retirement plan obligations of $64.7 million and a $6.0 million charge incurred in 2015 to settle legacy product liability claims. Product liability expense decreased $2.8 million in 2016 compared to 2015 due to a reduction in the frequency of reported claims. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in stock compensation expense of $2.5 million in 2016 compared to 2015 mainly due to a change in timing of our 2016 grants, which were granted earlier in 2016 than in 2015. SG&A expenses from acquisitions related to the Apex, Watts Korea, and PVI acquisitions. Total SG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 30.3% in 2016 compared to 33.5% in 2015.\n\nGross Profit. Gross profit and gross profit as a percent of net sales (gross margin) for 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nRecent Developments\nChanges in tax rates and tax laws are accounted for in the period of enactment and deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the enacted tax rate. Therefore, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a provisional charge of $25.1 million related to our current estimate of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act, including an estimated $23.3 million expense under the Toll Tax. The Toll Tax will be paid over an eight-year period, starting in 2018, and will not accrue interest.\nOrganic net sales in Europe increased $2.5 million primarily due to growth in the wholesale channel from increased sales of our drains products. This increase was also due to higher demand for our electronics products in Germany. These increases were partially offset by product rationalization and reduced demand for our HVAC products in Italy.\nIn 2015, we used $70.9 million of net cash from financing activities including $44.6 million used to repurchase approximately 813,000 shares of Class A common stock and $23.1 million used to pay dividends.\n\nIn 2017, we had eight reporting units. One of these reporting units, Water Quality, had no goodwill. We performed a qualitative analysis for six of the remaining seven reporting units, which include Bl\u00fccher, Dormont, US Drains, Europe, Residential and Commercial, and APMEA. For one reporting unit, Heating and Hot Water Solutions ( HHWS\u201d), we performed a quantitative analysis.\nThe change in organic net sales by channel in the Americas and APMEA excluded divested sales for both periods presented.\nThe increase in net sales from acquisitions in APMEA was related to the fourth quarter 2015 acquisition of Apex and the first quarter 2016 acquisition of Watts Korea. The increase in net sales from acquisitions in the Americas was related to the acquisition of PVI in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense decreased $1.7 million, or 7%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to the retirement in April 2016 of a $225 million higher interest bearing private placement note that was replaced by $230 million drawn on our line of credit. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nOn February 12, 2016, we terminated our prior Credit Agreement and entered into a new Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company who became borrowers under the Credit Agreement, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and Letter of Credit Issuer, and the other lenders referred to therein. The Credit Agreement provides for a $500 million, five-year, senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) with a sublimit of up to $100 million in letters of credit. The Credit Agreement also provided for a $300 million, five-year, term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility\u201d) available to us in a single draw. The Credit Agreement matures on February 12, 2021, subject to extension under certain circumstances and subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2017, we had $277.5 million of borrowings outstanding on the term loan and $147.0 million drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility; had $25.7 million of stand-by letters of credit outstanding and had $327.3 million of unused and available credit under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants related to the Credit Agreement.\nIn certain countries, additional inventory reserves are maintained for potential shrinkage experienced in the manufacturing process. The reserve is established based on the prior year's inventory losses adjusted for any change in the gross inventory balance.\nWe used $205.3 million of net cash from financing activities in 2017 primarily due to payments of long-term debt of $178.0 million, dividend payments of $25.9 million, and payments to repurchase approximately 278,000 shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $18.2 million. This was partially offset by proceeds from an additional draw on our line of credit of $20.0 million during 2017.\nOperating income in 2016 of $145.0 million increased by $235.1 million compared to 2015. This increase is primarily related to the $129.7 million goodwill impairment charge in the Europe reporting unit, the 2015 settlement charge of $64.7 million for certain long-term obligations, including our pension plan and supplemental employee retirement plan, $16.7 million less in restructuring costs recognized in 2016 compared to 2015, as well as the $6.0 million charge to settle legacy product liability claims in 2015. We also recognized a gain of $8.7 million in the second quarter of 2016 on the disposition of a subsidiary in China. The remaining $9.3 million increase was due to favorable sales mix, favorable sourcing, and productivity.\n 1) A review of the most recent fair value calculation to identify the extent of the cushion between fair value and carrying amount, to determine if a substantial cushion existed. \nThe change in operating income was attributable to the following:\nOrganic sales is a non-GAAP measure that excludes the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. Divested sales includes the exit of our non-core products through sale and through the discontinuation of product lines. Management believes reporting organic sales growth provides useful information to investors, potential investors and others, because it allows for a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. We reconcile the change in organic sales to our reported sales for each region within our results below.\nThe increase in gross margin percentage is attributable to increased volume, manufacturing productivity, changes to our product mix, and incremental savings from our transformation and restructuring programs primarily within the Americas and Europe.\nWorking capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) as of December 31, 2017 was $456.2 million compared to $393.9 million as of December 31, 2016. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.4 to 1 as of December 31, 2017 compared to 1.9 to 1 as of December 31, 2016. The increase in working capital is primarily related to more cash generated from operations, as well as less cash used for purchases of capital equipment and repurchases of common stock in 2017.\nWe are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as determining the Toll Tax, remeasuring our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act, we have made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 118), which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. As we collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS or other standard-setting bodies, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts. Those adjustments may materially impact the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period or periods in which the adjustments are made. The accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act will be completed in 2018.\nWe are a leading supplier of products and solutions that conserve water and manage the flow of fluids and energy into, through and out of buildings in the residential and commercial markets of the Americas, Europe and APMEA. For over 140 years, we have designed and produced valve systems that safeguard and regulate water systems, energy efficient heating and hydronic systems, drainage systems and water filtration technology that helps conserve water. We earn revenue and income almost exclusively from the sale of our products. Our principal product lines include:\nWe believe that the income approach is sensitive to the selected discount rate and the market approach is sensitive to valuation multiples used. We use third-party valuation specialists to help develop the appropriate discount rate and valuation multiples. We use standard valuation practices to arrive at a weighted average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d) based on the market and guideline public companies. The higher the discount rate, the lower the discounted cash flows. While we believe that our estimate of future cash flows and market approach valuations are reasonable, different assumptions could significantly affect our valuation and result in impairments in the future.\nOn December 16, 2016, Watts International Holdings Limited ( Watts International\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Facility Agreement (the Facility Agreement\u201d) among Watts International, as original borrower and original guarantor, Watts Water Technologies EMEA B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ( Watts EMEA\u201d), as original guarantor, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as sole bookrunner and sole lead arranger ( JP Morgan Chase Bank\u201d), J.P. Morgan Europe Limited, as agent to the financial parties, and the other lenders referred to therein. The Facility Agreement provides for a \u20ac110 million, 364 day, term loan facility available to the Company in a single draw. On December 20, 2016, Watts International borrowed the full amount available for borrowing under the Facility Agreement. The loan made on December 20, 2016 bears interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) the Euro InterBank Offered Rate (EURIBOR), provided that if such rate is less than zero, then EURIBOR shall be deemed to be zero, plus (ii) a margin of 1.875%, provided that if no event of default is continuing and Watts International's consolidated leverage ratio is at a specified level, the margin shall decrease to 1.50%. Accrued interest on the loan is payable on the last day of each interest period. The first interest period is set at one month and may be changed subsequently to a period of one, two, or three months (or such other period agreed with all the lenders). Substantially all of the proceeds of the borrowings made on December 20, 2016 under the Facility Agreement were used to pay down $113 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of the third quarter of 2017, the Company had repaid in full the Facility Agreement.\naddition, we may choose to opportunistically return cash to shareholders and pursue other business initiatives, including acquisition activities. We may, from time to time, also seek additional funding through a combination of equity and debt financings should we identify a significant new opportunity.\n\n \u00b7 A market risk premium that is determined, in part, through published historical studies adjusted for the business risk index for the reporting unit. The business risk index is derived from comparable companies and measures the estimated stock price volatility. \nOrganic net sales in the Americas increased $7.7 million compared to 2015 primarily due to growth in our wholesale markets and OEM channels, particularly relating to backflow, valve, and drainage products.\nGross Profit. Gross profit and gross profit as a percent of net sales (gross margin) for 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\nThe change in net sales was attributable to the following:\nOrganic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth that excludes the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from period-over-period comparisons. A reconciliation to the most closely related U.S.GAAP measure, net sales, has been included in our discussion within Results of Operations\u201d above. Organic net sales should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to net sales. Management believes reporting organic sales growth provides useful information to investors, potential investors and others, by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods.\nGoodwill and Other Long-Lived Asset Impairment Charges. In 2016, we recorded impairment charges of $0.5 million, primarily related to an indefinite lived tradename in the Europe reporting unit. In 2015, we recorded impairment charges of $130.5 million, primarily relating to a $129.7 million goodwill impairment charge in the Europe reporting unit. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these impairments.\nOperating Income (loss). Operating income (loss) by geographic segment for 2016 and 2015 was as follows:\n\nA discussion of recent accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe total pre-tax cost for our transformation program related to our Americas and APMEA businesses was $59.8 million, including restructuring costs of $18.1 million, goodwill and intangible asset impairments of $13.5 million and other transformation and deployment costs of approximately $28.3 million. The other transformation and deployment costs included consulting and project management fees, inventory write-offs, and other associated costs. The program originally included estimated pre-tax charges totaling approximately $65 million. In the third quarter of 2017, the total expected costs of the planned actions were reduced to approximately $60 million, primarily related to reduced expected facility exit costs and reduced other transformation and deployment costs. All costs associated with the Americas and APMEA transformation program were incurred as of December 31, 2017. Refer to Note 3 and Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n \u00b7 Water quality products-includes point-of-use and point-of-entry water filtration, conditioning and scale prevention systems for both commercial and residential applications. \ngoal is to be a solutions provider, not merely a components supplier. We continually look for strategic opportunities to invest in new products and markets or divest existing product lines where necessary in order to meet those objectives.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants related to the Credit Agreement.\n (a) as recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. \nA reconciliation of long-term debt (including current portion) to net debt and our net debt to capitalization ratio is provided below:\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe estimate and use our expected annual effective income tax rates to accrue income taxes. Effective tax rates are determined based on budgeted earnings before taxes, including our best estimate of permanent items that will affect the effective rate for the year. Management periodically reviews these rates with outside tax advisors and changes are made if material variances from expectations are identified.\n \u00b7 Comparable company and market interest rate information used to the determine the cost of debt and the appropriate long-term capital structure in order to weight the cost of debt and the cost of equity into an overall WACC. \nOn September 22, 2015, we signed an agreement to sell an operating subsidiary in China that was dedicated to the production of non-core products. The sale was finalized in the second quarter of 2016, and we received total proceeds of approximately $8.4 million from the sale as of the fourth quarter of 2016. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $8.7 million, which includes a non-cash accumulated currency translation adjustment of $7.3 million. The net after-tax gain was approximately $8.3 million.\nIncome taxes\nAs of December 31, 2017, our actual financial ratios calculated in accordance with our Credit Agreement compared to the required levels under the Credit Agreement were as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2017, our actual fixed charge coverage ratio calculated in accordance with our senior note agreements compared to the required ratio therein was as follows:\nWe have made numerous acquisitions over the years and have recognized a significant amount of goodwill. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using an income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, and when appropriate, guideline public company and guideline transaction market approaches.\nOur free cash flow increased in 2017 when compared to the free cash flow for 2016 primarily due to an increase in cash flows provided by operations and lower capital investment spending in 2017, partially offset by the timing of working capital fluctuations compared to 2016.\nThe net increase in sales due to foreign exchange was primarily due to the appreciation of the euro and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar in 2017. We cannot predict whether foreign currencies will appreciate or depreciate against the U.S. dollar in future periods or whether future foreign exchange rate fluctuations will have a positive or negative impact on our net sales.\nProducts representing a majority of our sales are subject to regulatory standards and code enforcement, which typically require that these products meet stringent performance criteria. Together with our commissioned manufacturers' representatives, we have consistently advocated for the development and enforcement of such plumbing codes. We are focused on maintaining stringent quality control and testing procedures at each of our manufacturing facilities in order to manufacture products in compliance with code requirements and take advantage of the resulting demand for compliant products. We believe that the product development, product testing capability and investment in plant and equipment needed to manufacture products in compliance with code requirements, represent a competitive advantage for us.\nGoodwill and other intangibles\nIn 2015, we used $17.3 million of net cash for investing activities, including $20.4 million for the purchase of Apex and $27.7 million of cash for capital equipment, offset by cash proceeds of approximately $33.1 million for the sale of certain assets relating to divested product lines in the Americas.\nOn February 8, 2018, we declared a quarterly dividend of nineteen cents ($0.19) per share on each outstanding share of Class A common stock and Class B common stock payable on March 16, 2018 to stockholders of record on March 2, 2018.\n \u00b7 Residential & commercial flow control products-includes products typically sold into plumbing and hot water applications such as backflow preventers, water pressure regulators, temperature and pressure relief valves, and thermostatic mixing valves. \nCovenant compliance\nIn 2016, we generated $138.1 million of cash from operating activities as compared to $109.4 million in 2015. Cash flows from operating activities in 2015 included a $49.2 million settlement of certain long-term obligations, including pension obligations. We generated approximately $102.2 million of free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure, which we reconcile below, defined as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures plus proceeds from sale of assets), compared to free cash flow of $81.8 million in 2015.\nWe first identify those reporting units that we believe could pass a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. For each reporting unit identified, our qualitative analysis includes:\n\n\n\nA valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We consider estimated future taxable income and future reversals of the deferred tax liabilities in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\nIn 2016, we generated $27.7 million of net cash from financing activities as compared to $70.9 million of net cash used in 2015. The increase in cash generated is primarily due to net proceeds from long-term borrowings of $74.4 million and $17.8 million less in stock repurchases in 2016. We also received an additional $5.7 million in cash proceeds from share transactions under employee stock plans in 2016 compared to 2015.\nWe recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: (1) we have entered into a binding agreement, (2) the product has shipped and title has passed, (3) the sales price to the customer is fixed or is determinable and\nOperating Income (Loss). Operating income (loss) by geographic segment for 2017 and 2016 was as follows:\n2015 Cash Flows\nIn 2015, we generated $109.4 million of cash from operating activities as compared to $135.2 million in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the $49.2 million settlement of certain long-term obligations, including the pension plan, offset by inventory reduction efforts and stronger accounts receivable collections. We generated approximately $81.8 million of free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure, which we reconcile below, defined as net cash provided by continuing operating activities minus capital expenditures plus proceeds from sale of assets).\n\n\nOverall, reported sales for 2017 increased 4.2%, or $58.3 million, primarily related to an increase in acquired sales of $47.0 million, or 3.3%, relating to the acquisitions of PVI and Watts Korea, an increase in organic sales of $7.0 million, or 0.5%, and an increase in sales due to foreign exchange of $7.8 million, or 0.7%.This increase was partially offset by a decrease in sales of $3.5 million related to product lines we divested by the first quarter of 2016 in the Americas segment as part of our Americas transformation program. Compared to 2016, reported sales as a percentage of segment sales in the Americas and Europe increased by 5.6% and 2.1%, respectively, while reported sales in APMEA declined by 2.6%. As a percentage of segment sales, organic sales in the Americas and Europe increased 0.8% and 0.6% respectively, while organic sales in APMEA declined by 4.6% compared to 2016. The increase in organic sales in the Americas was primarily driven by increased sales in our valve, HVAC, and drainage products, partially offset by declines in our tankless water heater and condensing boiler products. In Europe, the increase was primarily driven by our drains and electronics products, offset by a decline in our plumbing products due to the impact of product rationalization. The decline in APMEA sales primarily related to the impact of product rationalization, partially offset by increased demand for our underfloor heating products and commercial valves and growth in Korea. Operating income of $162.3 million increased by $17.3 million, or 11.9% compared to 2016. This increase is driven by incremental transformation and productivity savings, lower transformation costs, the acquisition of PVI, and higher sales volume.\nWe have one senior note agreement as further detailed in Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report Form 10-K. This senior note agreement requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of consolidated EBITDA plus consolidated rent expense during the period to consolidated fixed charges. Consolidated fixed charges are the sum of consolidated interest expense for the period and consolidated rent expense.\nExcept for operating lease commitments, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nGain on disposition. In the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $8.7 million related to the sale of a China subsidiary that was dedicated to the production of non-core products and part of the transformation of our Americas and APMEA businesses. The pre-tax gain included a non-cash accumulated currency translation adjustment of $7.3 million.\n\n\nWe are a defendant in numerous legal matters including those involving environmental issues and product liability as discussed in more detail in Part I, Item 1. Business-Product Liability, Environmental and Other Litigation Matters.\u201d As required by GAAP, we determine whether an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and the loss amount can be reasonably estimated. When it is possible to estimate reasonably possible loss or range of loss above the amount accrued, that estimate is aggregated and disclosed. Estimates of potential outcomes of these contingencies are often developed in consultation with outside counsel. While this assessment is based upon all available information, litigation is inherently uncertain and the actual liability to fully resolve litigation cannot be predicted with any assurance of accuracy. In the event of an unfavorable outcome in one or more legal matters, the ultimate liability may be in excess of amounts currently accrued, if any, and may be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular quarterly or annual period. However, based on information currently known to us, management believes that the ultimate outcome of all legal contingencies, as they are resolved over time, is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, though the outcome could be material to our operating results for any particular period depending, in part, upon the operating results for such period.\n \u00b7 Drainage & water re-use products-includes drainage products and engineered rain water harvesting solutions for commercial, industrial, marine and residential applications. \nWe believe that the factors relating to our future growth include continued product innovation that meets the needs of our customers and our end markets; our ability to make selective acquisitions, both in our core markets as well as in new complementary markets; regulatory requirements relating to the quality and conservation of water and the safe use of water; increased demand for clean water; continued enforcement of plumbing and building codes; and a healthy economic environment. We have completed 10 acquisitions in the last decade. Our acquisition strategy focuses on businesses that promote our key macro themes around safety & regulation, energy efficiency and water conservation. We target businesses that will provide us with one or more of the following: an entry into new markets and/or new geographies, improved channel access, unique and/or proprietary technologies, advanced production capabilities or complementary solution offerings.\n \u00b7 A risk free rate based on the 20-year U.S. Treasury Bonds as of the assessment date. \nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with costs determined primarily on a first-in first-out basis. We utilize both specific product identification and historical product demand as the basis for determining our excess or obsolete inventory reserve. We identify all inventories that exceed a range of one to three years in sales. This is determined by comparing the current inventory balance against unit sales for the trailing twelve months. New products added to inventory within the past twelve months are excluded from this analysis. A portion of our products contain recoverable materials, therefore the excess and obsolete reserve is established net of any recoverable amounts. Changes in market conditions, lower-than- expected customer demand or changes in technology or features could result in additional obsolete inventory that is not saleable and could require additional inventory reserve provisions.\nGoodwill and Other Long-Lived Asset Impairment Charges. In 2017, we recorded an impairment of $1.0 million, primarily related to a technology asset in the Americas operating segment. In 2016, we recorded impairment charges of $0.5 million, primarily related to an indefinite lived tradename in the Europe operating segment. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these impairments.\nThe increase in net sales from acquisitions in the Americas and APMEA segments are related to the fourth quarter 2016 acquisition of PVI and the first quarter 2016 acquisition of Watts Korea, respectively.\nOrganic net sales in the APMEA wholesale market increased as compared to 2015 primarily due to strong demand for our underfloor heating products for residential applications as well as for our water and plumbing products outside of China.\nNew Accounting Standards\nIn addition to financial ratios, the Credit Agreement and senior note agreement contain affirmative and negative covenants that include limitations on disposition or sale of assets, prohibitions on assuming or incurring any liens on assets with limited exceptions and limitations on making investments other than those permitted by the agreements.\nNet Sales. Our business is reported in three geographic segments: Americas, Europe and APMEA. Our net sales in each of these segments for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nThe net decrease in sales due to foreign exchange was primarily due to the depreciation of the euro, Chinese yuan and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar in 2016. We cannot predict whether foreign currencies will appreciate or depreciate against the U.S. dollar in future periods or whether future foreign exchange rate fluctuations will have a positive or negative impact on our net sales.\nThe 2017 Tax Act was enacted on December 22, 2017 and introduces significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effective in 2018, the 2017 Tax Act reduces the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings and certain related-party payments, which are referred to as the global intangible low-taxed income tax and the base erosion tax, respectively. In addition, in 2017 we are subject to the Toll Tax, a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax. Accounting for the income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act requires significant judgments and estimates in the interpretation and calculations of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act.\n2017 Cash Flows\nThe change in organic net sales as a percentage of consolidated net sales and of segment net sales in the Americas and APMEA excluded divested sales for both periods presented.\nBecause of retention requirements associated with our insurance policies, we are generally self-insured for potential product liability claims. We are subject to a variety of potential liabilities in connection with product liability cases and we maintain a high self-insured retention limit within our product liability and general liability coverage, which we believe to be generally in accordance with industry practices. For product liability cases in the U.S., management establishes its product liability accrual, which includes legal costs associated with accrued claims, by utilizing third-party actuarial valuations which incorporate historical trend factors and our specific claims experience derived from loss reports provided by third-party administrators. The product liability accrual is established after considering any applicable insurance coverage. Changes in the nature of product liability claims, legal costs, or the actual settlement amounts could affect the adequacy of the estimates and require changes to the accrual. Because the liability is an estimate, the ultimate liability may be more or less than reported.\n(4) collectability is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue based upon a determination that all criteria for revenue recognition have been met, which, based on the majority of our shipping terms, is considered to have occurred upon shipment of the finished product. Some shipping terms require the goods to be received by the customer before title passes. In those instances, revenues are not recognized until the customer has received the goods. We record estimated reductions to revenue and a corresponding asset for customer returns and allowances and for customer programs. Provisions for returns and allowances are made at the time of sale, derived from historical trends and form a portion of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Customer programs, which are primarily annual volume incentive plans, allow customers to earn credit for attaining agreed upon purchase targets from us. We record estimated reductions to revenue, made at the time of sale, for customer programs based on estimated purchase targets.\nThe decrease in total net sales due to divested products of $98.0 million was a result of the exit of our low margin, non-core products beginning after the first quarter 2015 in our Americas and APMEA segments. Divested sales included the exit of our non-core products through sale and through the discontinuation of product lines.", "item_7_text": "Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses decreased $67.2 million, or 13.7%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in SG&A expenses was attributable to the following:\nAmericas' gross margin percentage increased compared to 2015 due primarily to a favorable product mix, including the 2015 exit of our low-margin, non-core product lines, as well as manufacturing efficiencies and commodity cost savings. Europe's gross margin percentage increased marginally due to manufacturing productivity, restructuring savings and commodity cost savings, compared to 2015. APMEA's gross margin percentage increased compared to 2015 primarily due to increased trade sales and product mix, offset by the decreased intercompany activity.\n\nResults for 2015 include an after-tax charge of $126.8 million, or $3.63 per common share, for goodwill and other long-lived asset impairment charges; $44.6 million, or $1.28 per common share, for long-term obligation settlements including pension obligations; $13.9 million, or $0.40 per common share, for restructuring; $9.0 million, or $0.26 per common share, for the Europe and Americas transformation deployment costs; $3.7 million, or $0.11 per common share, for legal and other settlements; and $0.9 million, or $0.03 per common share, for acquisition related costs.\n\nThe organic sales increase of $7.0 million was partially muted by the $15.1 million impact of our ongoing product rationalization efforts across our regions, as we continue to focus on our core product lines. The product rationalization mainly affected our DIY and OEM channels.\nWe generated $155.9 million of net cash from operating activities in 2017 as compared to $138.1 million of net cash generated from operating activities in 2016. The increase was primarily related to higher net income after excluding the non-cash effect of the 2017 Tax Act and the impact of non-cash adjustments, partially offset by the timing of working capital fluctuations compared to 2016. We generated $126.9 million of free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure, which we reconcile below, defined as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures plus proceeds from sale of assets), compared to free cash flow of $102.2 million in 2016.\nResults for 2016 include after-tax benefits of $8.3 million, or $0.24 per common share, for a gain on disposition and $1.0 million, or $0.03 per common share, for a gain on acquisition of Watts Korea, offset by an after-tax charge of $8.8 million, or $0.26 per common share, for the Europe and Americas transformation deployment costs; $3.2 million, or $0.09 per common share, for restructuring charges; $1.3 million, or $0.04 per common share for purchase accounting adjustments related to our acquisitions in 2016; $1.2 million, or $0.03 per common share for acquisition costs in 2016; and $2.6 million, or $0.08 per common share for other items, primarily related to tax charges related to the transformation.\nThe expected cash flows are discounted to present value using a WACC. The key assumptions used to determine the appropriate WACC rates utilized in the income approach for the HHWS reporting unit were as follows:\nThe 2017 Tax Act has resulted in significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system and was enacted on December 22, 2017. These changes include a federal statutory rate reduction from 35% to 21% effective on January 1, 2018, the elimination or reduction of certain domestic deductions and credits, and limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation. The 2017 Tax Act transitions international taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system and includes base erosion prevention measures on non-U.S. earnings. The 2017 Tax Act also includes a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign subsidiaries' previously untaxed foreign earnings ( Toll Tax\u201d).\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\n\n (c) the payment in less than one year represents the second year of amortization of the term loan under the Credit Agreement. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details of our financing arrangements. \nInventory valuation\nAcquisitions and Disposals\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP measure that does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Therefore it should not be considered an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities as an indication of our performance. The cash conversion rate of free cash flow to net income is also a measure of our performance in cash flow generation. We believe free cash flow to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating performance because it provides investors with a measure of our ability to generate cash, repay debt, pay dividends, repurchase stock and fund acquisitions.\nOur innovation strategy is focused on differentiated products that provide greater opportunity to distinguish ourselves in the market place. Conversely, we want to migrate away from commoditized products where we cannot add value. Our\n\nAdjusted operating income, adjusted operating margins, adjusted net income, and adjusted earnings per share are non-GAAP measures that exclude certain expenses that relate primarily to our global restructuring programs, deployment\nWe used $27.3 million of net cash for investing activities in 2017 compared to $114.0 million in 2016. We used $88.1 million less cash in 2017 for acquisitions as 2016 included the acquisition of PVI and Watts Korea. We used $6.6 million less cash for purchases of capital equipment compared to 2016. The decrease in cash used for investing activities was partially offset by a $1.5 million purchase of additional intangible assets, and $6.8 million less cash generated from the sale of assets in 2017. We anticipate investing between $36 million to $40 million in capital equipment in 2018 to improve our manufacturing capabilities.\nRevenue recognition\nWe have historically financed our operating and capital needs primarily through cash flows generated by our operations. We expect to continue funding future operating requirements principally through our cash flows from operations, in addition to existing cash resources. We believe that our existing funds, when combined with cash generated from operations and our ability to access additional financing resources, if needed, are sufficient to satisfy our operating, working capital, strategic initiatives, capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future. In\nGain on disposition. In the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $8.7 million related to the sale of a China subsidiary that was dedicated to the production of non-core products and part of the transformation of our Americas and APMEA businesses. The pre-tax gain included a non-cash accumulated currency translation adjustment of $7.3 million.\nWe then compile this information and make our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we determine it is not more likely than not, then no further quantitative analysis is required.\nOn November 30, 2015, we acquired 80% of the outstanding shares of Apex Valves Limited ( Apex\u201d). Apex specializes in the design and manufacturing of control valves for low and high pressure hot water and filtration systems. Apex also produces an extensive range of float and reservoir valves for the agricultural industry. The aggregate purchase price was approximately $20.4 million and we recorded a long-term liability of $5.5 million as the estimate of the acquisition date fair value on the contractual call option to purchase the remaining 20% within three years of closing. Apex manufactures high-end valves for the New Zealand market that we believe could be introduced in the China market and other countries in South East Asia. We acquired an additional 10% ownership in the first quarter of 2017 for approximately $2.9 million and now own 90% of the outstanding shares of Apex. We maintain a current liability of approximately $2.9 million for the estimated fair value on the remaining 10% contractual call option, which is expected to be exercised in 2018.\nThe increase in consolidated operating income was primarily driven by increased volume and gross margin improvements in the Americas, as well as savings from our restructuring initiatives in Europe. The increase in operating income was also driven by reduced transformation costs compared to 2016 in the Americas and APMEA as our transformation program was completed in 2017. Contributing to the increase in consolidated operating income was $2.9 million from the acquisition of PVI. Included in operating income in 2016 was an $8.7 million gain on a disposition of a China subsidiary.\nIn December 2017, we concluded our transformation program relating to our Americas and APMEA businesses, which primarily involved the exit and discontinuation of low-margin, non-core product lines, enhancing global sourcing capabilities and the reduction of the square footage of our Americas facilities. The transformation program was approved by our Board of Directors in 2015. Over the course of the program, we eliminated approximately $165 million of the combined Americas and APMEA net sales, primarily within our do-it-yourself (DIY) distribution channel. As part of the exit of non-core product lines, we entered into an agreement to sell an operating subsidiary in China that was dedicated exclusively to the manufacturing of products being discontinued. The sale was finalized in the second quarter of 2016, and we recognized a pre-tax gain of $8.7 million and received proceeds from the sale of $8.4 million. The program also involved the consolidation of manufacturing facilities and distribution center network optimization, reducing the square footage of our Americas facilities net operating footprint by approximately 30%. The footprint focus of the program was designed to improve the utilization of our remaining facilities, better leverage our cost structure, reduce working capital, and improve execution of customer delivery requirements.\nOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 are presented in the following table:\nFor the HHWS reporting unit, the underlying analyses supporting our fair value assessment are related to our comparable companies' historical and projected results, current transaction values and our outlook of our business' long-term performance, which included key assumptions as to the appropriate revenue and EBITDA multiples, discount rate and long-term growth rate. In connection with the HHWS impairment assessment, we utilized a discount rate of 9% and growth rates beyond our planning periods ranging from 5% to 7% and a long-term terminal growth rate of 3%. Future increases in discount rates due to changing interest rates or a declining economic environment and different market multiples could impact our assumptions and the value of our reporting units. However, taking into consideration the various elements of the 2017 Tax Act would result in a net increase to the discounted cash flows generated by the reporting unit in our strategic plan, which would increase the fair value of the reporting unit.\nOther expense (income), net. Other expense (income), net, decreased $5.5 million to a net expense balance of $1.1 million in 2017 as compared to a net other income balance of ($4.4) million in 2016. Included in other income in 2016 was a $1.7 million non-cash gain recognized on the acquisition of Watts Korea. The remaining decrease is primarily due to net foreign currency transaction losses in 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we held $280.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. Of this amount, $259.3 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2017, we considered none of our earnings to be permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. Previously, earnings of foreign subsidiaries were only subject to U.S. income tax upon repatriation to the U.S. However, the 2017 Tax Act, requires us to pay a one-time deemed repatriation toll charge on cumulative undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not previously provided U.S. taxes. Cumulative earnings in the form of cash and cash equivalents, as defined in the 2017 Tax Act, will be taxed at a rate of 15.5% and all other earnings will be taxed at a rate of 8.0%. We estimate that our obligation associated with this one-time deemed repatriation toll charge to be $23.3 million, which will be paid in installments over eight years. We can repatriate cumulative undistributed foreign earnings back to the U.S. when needed and have recorded provisional charges of $14.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 related to future repatriation of earnings. Over the next twelve months we expect to repatriate approximately $125 million of cash back to the U.S. We are currently evaluating all potential uses for the cash in the U.S., with debt reduction expected to be a priority.\n2016 Cash Flows\nUnder the Credit Agreement, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios and other financial condition tests as of December 31, 2017. The financial ratios included a consolidated interest coverage ratio based on consolidated earnings before income taxes, interest expense, depreciation, and amortization (Consolidated EBITDA) to consolidated interest expense, as defined in the Credit Agreement. Our Credit Agreement defined Consolidated EBITDA to exclude unusual or non-recurring charges and gains. We were also required to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of consolidated funded debt to Consolidated EBITDA. Consolidated funded debt, as defined in the Credit Agreement, included all long and short-term debt, capital lease obligations and any trade letters of credit that are outstanding, less cash on the balance sheet that exceeded $50 million.\nNet Sales. Our business is reported in three geographic segments: Americas, Europe and APMEA. Our net sales in each of these segments for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were as follows:\nChanges in tax rates and tax laws are accounted for in the period of enactment and deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the enacted tax rate. Therefore, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a charge totaling $25.1 million related to our current estimate of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act, including an estimated $23.3 million expense under the Toll Tax. The Toll Tax will be paid over an eight-year period, starting in 2018, and will not accrue interest. The provisions of the 2017 Tax Act allows us more flexibility in deploying our global cash resources as we continue to drive a balanced capital allocation strategy. We expect that the 2017 Tax Act will have a positive effect on our income tax rate in 2018.\nIn 2017, we successfully completed our transformation programs and realized the benefits of our product portfolio rationalization, footprint optimization, and global sourcing initiatives, while simultaneously reinvesting in the business. We continued to drive commercial and operational excellence. We completed the integration of PVI Industries, LLC ( PVI\u201d) to our portfolio during the year. We continued to streamline our product portfolio across the regions as we focus on our core product lines and rationalize certain low-margin, non-core products. Our financial performance in 2017 was solid, driven by growth in the Americas and Europe segments and realization of our productivity and transformation savings.\nSG&A expenses increased primarily as a result of our 2016 acquisitions of PVI and Watts Korea, as well as increases in foreign exchange primarily from the appreciation of the euro and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar compared to 2016. Organically SG&A expenses decreased $7.3 million compared to 2016, primarily related to a decline in product liability costs of $9.4 million, lower transformation costs of $8.1 million as we completed our transformation program in 2017, and lower property tax and other tax charges of $1.1 million. The decline in product liability costs was primarily due to the resolution of the class action lawsuits related to certain legacy claims for undifferentiated products which we have exited, and the associated reduction in reported claims. The organic decrease was partially offset by $8.2 million for investments in strategic initiatives, which includes $2.5 million in research and development costs, and$4.2 million of higher distribution and freight costs. Total SG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 29.7% in 2017 compared to 30.3% in 2016.\n\nOur net debt to capitalization ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure used by management, decreased to 20.7% for 2017 from 29.8% in 2016. The decrease was driven by a decrease in net debt outstanding at December 31, 2017, primarily due to the full repayment of the Facility Agreement during the third quarter of 2017. Management believes the net debt to capitalization ratio is an appropriate supplemental measure because it helps investors understand our ability to meet our financing needs and serves as a basis to evaluate our financial structure. Our computation may not be comparable to other companies that may define their net debt to capitalization ratios differently.\nRestructuring. In 2017, we recorded a net charge of $6.8 million, primarily for the transformation of our Americas business, involuntary terminations and other costs incurred as part of our restructuring initiatives, as compared to a net charge of $4.7 million in 2016. For a more detailed description of our current restructuring plans, see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report Form 10-K.\nWe maintain letters of credit that guarantee our performance or payment to third parties in accordance with specified terms and conditions. Amounts outstanding were approximately $25.7 million as of December 31, 2017 and $25.6 million as of December 31, 2016. Our letters of credit are primarily associated with insurance coverage and, to a lesser extent, foreign purchases and generally expire within one year of issuance. These instruments may exist or expire without being drawn down; therefore they do not necessarily represent future cash flow obligations and are not included in the table above.\nResults of Operations\n\nThe estimated fair value of the reporting unit of $397.0 million exceeded the carrying value of $373.8 million by approximately $23.2 million, or 6%, in 2017 and therefore, no impairment was recorded.\nResults of Operations\nWe determine the trend factors for product liability based on consultation with outside actuaries. We maintain excess liability insurance to minimize our risks related to claims in excess of our primary insurance policies. Any material change in the aforementioned factors could have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nOur products are sold to wholesalers, OEMs, various specialty channels and DIY chains. The change in organic net sales by channel was attributable to the following:\nThe change in net sales was attributable to the following:\nOrganic net sales in APMEA decreased $2.9 million driven primarily by the impact of product rationalization. This decrease was offset partly by higher demand in China for our residential underfloor heating products and commercial valves products, as well as growth in South Korea from an expanded product offering.\nOur business is reported in three geographic segments: Americas, Europe, and APMEA. We distribute our products through four primary distribution channels: wholesale, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), specialty, and do-it-yourself (DIY). In September 2015, we divested a substantial portion of our DIY business in the Americas, which reduced the significance of DIY as a distribution channel for our products in 2017 and 2016.\nIntangible assets such as trademarks and trade names are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition. Values assigned to intangible assets are determined by an independent valuation firm based on our estimates and judgments regarding expectations of the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. Accounting guidance allows us to perform a qualitative impairment assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets consistent with the goodwill guidance noted previously. For our 2017 impairment assessment, which occurred as of October 29, 2017, we performed quantitative assessments for all indefinite-lived intangible assets. The methodology we employed was the relief from royalty method, a subset of the income approach. During 2017, no impairment was recognized on our indefinite-lived intangible assets. In 2016, we recognized a non-cash pre-tax charge of approximately $0.4 million related to an indefinite lived tradename in our Europe reporting unit. In 2015, we recognized a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $0.6 million of certain of our indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nAs of our October 29, 2017 testing date, we had $547.5 million of goodwill on our balance sheet. As a result of our qualitative analyses, we determined that the fair values of the six reporting units noted above were more likely than not greater than the carrying amounts. We performed a quantitative impairment analysis for the HHWS reporting unit in connection with the annual strategic plan and due to underperformance to budget, primarily caused by continuing softness in the condensing boiler market, weakness in our tankless water heater products and competitive pricing pressure. We estimated the fair value of the reporting unit using a weighted calculation of the income approach and the market approach. Inherent in our development of the fair value of the reporting unit are the assumptions and estimates used in the income, and where appropriate, market approaches. The income approach calculates the present value of future cash flow projections based on assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results, business plans, expected growth rates, the appropriate revenue and EBITDA multiples, and discount rates. We also made certain assumptions about future economic conditions and market data. We developed our assumptions based on our historical results, including sales growth, operating profits, working capital levels and income tax rates. The market approach calculates the estimated fair value based on valuation multiples derived from stock prices and enterprise values of publicly traded companies that are comparable to the reporting unit and based on valuation multiples are derived from actual transactions for comparable public companies when appropriate.\nLegal contingencies\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and Key Estimates\nProduct liability\nA reconciliation of capitalization is provided below:\n\nThe decrease in total net sales due to divested products of $3.5 million relates to the discontinuation of product lines we divested by the end of the first quarter of 2016 in the Americas segment as part of our Americas transformation program.\nOn November 2, 2016, we acquired 100% of the shares of PVI Riverside Holdings, Inc., the parent company of PVI. The aggregate purchase price, including the final working capital adjustment, was approximately $79.1 million. PVI is a leading manufacturer of commercial stainless steel water heating equipment, focused on the high capacity market in North America and is based in Fort Worth, Texas. PVI's water heater product offering complements AERCO's boiler products, allowing us to address customers' heating and hot water requirements.\nThe change in organic net sales as a percentage of consolidated net sales and of segment net sales in the Americas excludes divested sales for both periods presented.\nItem 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense decreased $3.5 million, or 15.5%, in 2017 from 2016 as we repaid over $150 million in outstanding debt during 2017. Further, our weighted average interest rate decreased marginally year to year as we retired higher cost private placement debt in the middle of 2016 and replaced with lower cost revolver debt and we replaced certain U.S. based revolver debt with lower cost euro denominated debt in late 2016. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nOrganic net sales in Europe increased slightly compared to 2015 mainly due to improved demand in certain key markets such as Italy, and new product introductions in our electronics platform. These increases were partially offset by declines in the OEM boiler market in Germany, sales declines in France, and by project delays in our drains business partly driven by the impact of economic and political uncertainty in the UK.\nIn 2016, we used $114.0 million of net cash for investing activities compared to $17.3 million in 2015. We used $67.6 million more cash in 2016 than 2015 relating to the acquisitions of PVI and Watts Korea. We also increased our purchases of capital equipment during 2016 by $8.3 million. In 2015, we received approximately $20.8 million more in cash proceeds from the sale of assets, primarily relating to the sale of non-core product lines in the Americas.\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\n 2) A review of events and circumstances that have occurred since the most recent fair value calculation to determine if those events or circumstances would have affected our previous fair value assessment. Items identified and reviewed include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market changes, cost factor changes, events that affect the reporting unit, and financial performance against expectations and the reporting unit's performance relative to peers. \nOur products are sold to wholesalers, OEMs, various specialty channels, and DIY chains. The change in organic net sales by channel was attributable to the following:\nNet Income (Loss). Net income for 2017 was $73.1 million, or $2.12 per common share, compared to $84.2 million, or $2.44 per common share, for 2016. Results for 2017 include a charge of $25.1 million within income tax expense, or $0.73 per common share, related to the impact of the 2017 Tax Act, $1.9 million, or $0.06 per common share, for the Europe and Americas transformation costs; $4.7 million, or $0.14 per common share, for restructuring charges; $0.6 million, or $0.02 per common share for long-lived asset impairment charges, partially offset by $1.6 million or $0.05 per common share in tax benefits.\nOn February 26, 2016, we acquired an additional 50% of the outstanding shares of Watts Korea for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $4 million. Prior to February 26, 2016, the Company held a 40% interest in Watts Korea, which operated as a joint venture. We acquired the remaining 10% ownership in the fourth quarter of 2016 and now own 100% of Watts Korea. Watts Korea strengthens our strategic vision to expand solutions sales into the Korean market. We accounted for the transaction as a step acquisition within a business combination. We recognized a $1.7 million pre-tax gain on the previously held 40% ownership interest in the first quarter of 2016.\nWe periodically discuss the development, selection and disclosure of the estimates with our Audit Committee. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses increased $8.2 million, or 1.9%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase in SG&A expenses was attributable to the following:\n \u00b7 A small stock premium based on the size of the reporting unit. \nOrganic net sales in the Americas increased $7.4 million mainly from growth in the wholesale channel, driven by valve, HVAC, and drainage products. This increase was partially offset by declines in the specialty channels, where we experienced weakness in our tankless water heater and condensing boiler products. There was also a decrease in the DIY channel due to the product rationalization discussed above.\nIncome Taxes. Our effective income tax rate changed to 48.9% in 2017, from 34.1% in 2016. The tax rate increased primarily due to the impact of the 2017 Tax Act, which was enacted on December 22, 2017, and has resulted in significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system. These changes include lowering the corporate tax rate from\nOther income, net. Other income, net, increased $2.0 million to an income balance of $4.4 million in 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to the $1.7 million non-cash gain recognized on the acquisition of Watts Korea in the first quarter of 2016. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details on the acquisition. The remaining increase is due to net foreign currency transaction gains in 2016 as a result of the depreciation of the euro and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar in 2016 compared to 2015.\nIn 2015, we recognized a pre-tax impairment charge of $129.7 million in the Europe reporting unit. The remaining goodwill balance as of December 31, 2015 in this reporting unit was $46.4 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nA reconciliation of U.S. GAAP results to these adjusted non-GAAP measures is provided below:\n \u00b7 HVAC & gas products-includes commercial high-efficiency boilers, water heaters and heating solutions, hydronic and electric heating systems for under-floor radiant applications, custom heat and hot water solutions, hydronic pump groups for boiler manufacturers and alternative energy control packages, and flexible stainless steel connectors for natural and liquid propane gas in commercial food service and residential applications. HVAC is an acronym for heating, ventilation and air conditioning. \nNet Income (loss). Net income was $84.2 million, or $2.45 per common share, compared to a net loss of ($112.9) million, or ($3.24) per common share, for 2015. Results for 2016 include after-tax benefits for a gain on disposition of $8.3 million, or $0.24 per common share, and $1.0 million, or $0.03 per common share, for a gain on acquisition of Watts Korea, offset by an after-tax charge of $8.8 million, or $0.26 per common share, for the Europe and Americas transformation deployment costs; $3.2 million, or $0.09 per common share, for restructuring charges; $1.3 million, or $0.04 per common share for purchase accounting adjustments related to our acquisitions in 2016; $1.2 million, or $0.03 per common share for acquisition costs in 2016; and $2.6 million, or $0.08 per common share for other items, primarily related to tax charges related to the transformation.\nA reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow and calculation of our cash conversion rate is provided below:\nRestructuring. In 2016, we recorded a net charge of $4.7 million primarily for the transformation of our Americas and APMEA businesses and involuntary terminations and other costs incurred as part of our Europe restructuring plans, as compared to $21.4 million in 2015. For a more detailed description of our current restructuring plans, see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. A critical accounting estimate is an assumption about highly uncertain matters and could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements if another, also reasonable, amount were used, or, a change in the estimate is reasonably likely from period to period. We base our assumptions on historical experience and on other estimates that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. There were no significant changes in our accounting policies or significant changes in our accounting estimates during 2017.\nOverview\nPrior to 2017, our Europe segment was formerly referred to as EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) and our APMEA segment was formerly referred to as Asia-Pacific. As of January 1, 2017, we began reporting the results of Watts Industries Middle East, an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary, within our APMEA segment to align with internal operating changes. These results had previously been reported within our former EMEA segment. This change does not affect our reportable segments but represents only a change in composition that better aligns with the structure of our internal organization. The 2016 and 2015 results by segment have been retrospectively revised for comparative purposes.\nIn accordance with the SEC's Regulation G and item 10(e) of Regulation S-K, the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures used by management. We believe that these measures provide for a more complete perspective of underlying business results and trends. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measure, but rather as supplemental information to more fully understand our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted.\nIncome Taxes. Our effective income tax rate changed to 34.1% in 2016, from (1.7%) in 2015. The significant change in the tax rate was due to the impact that the non-deductible and other income tax reserve items had on a loss before income taxes reported in 2015, primarily related to the goodwill impairment charge and the settlement of our pension plan and supplemental employee retirement plan obligations.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\n\nThe increase (decrease) in operating income (loss) is attributable to the following:\ncosts, acquisition related costs, purchase accounting adjustments, gains on acquisition and disposition, goodwill and other long-lived asset impairments, certain other costs and the related income tax impacts on these items and other tax adjustments, including the impact of the 2017 Tax Act. Management believes reporting these financial measures provides useful information to investors, potential investors and others, by facilitating easier comparisons of our performance with prior and future periods.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions, determining our provision for income taxes, and evaluating the impact of the 2017 Tax Act.\nAccounting guidance allows us to review goodwill for impairment utilizing either qualitative or quantitative analyses. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then performing the quantitative impairment test is unnecessary.\n (b) the majority relates to commodity and capital commitments at December 31, 2017. \n35% to 21% in 2018, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time deemed repatriation toll tax on cumulative undistributed foreign earnings.\nContractual Obligations\nThe organic decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily due to the 2015 settlement of certain long-term obligations, including our pension plan and supplemental employee retirement plan obligations of $64.7 million and a $6.0 million charge incurred in 2015 to settle legacy product liability claims. Product liability expense decreased $2.8 million in 2016 compared to 2015 due to a reduction in the frequency of reported claims. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in stock compensation expense of $2.5 million in 2016 compared to 2015 mainly due to a change in timing of our 2016 grants, which were granted earlier in 2016 than in 2015. SG&A expenses from acquisitions related to the Apex, Watts Korea, and PVI acquisitions. Total SG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 30.3% in 2016 compared to 33.5% in 2015.\n\nGross Profit. Gross profit and gross profit as a percent of net sales (gross margin) for 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nRecent Developments\nChanges in tax rates and tax laws are accounted for in the period of enactment and deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the enacted tax rate. Therefore, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a provisional charge of $25.1 million related to our current estimate of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act, including an estimated $23.3 million expense under the Toll Tax. The Toll Tax will be paid over an eight-year period, starting in 2018, and will not accrue interest.\nOrganic net sales in Europe increased $2.5 million primarily due to growth in the wholesale channel from increased sales of our drains products. This increase was also due to higher demand for our electronics products in Germany. These increases were partially offset by product rationalization and reduced demand for our HVAC products in Italy.\nIn 2015, we used $70.9 million of net cash from financing activities including $44.6 million used to repurchase approximately 813,000 shares of Class A common stock and $23.1 million used to pay dividends.\n\nIn 2017, we had eight reporting units. One of these reporting units, Water Quality, had no goodwill. We performed a qualitative analysis for six of the remaining seven reporting units, which include Bl\u00fccher, Dormont, US Drains, Europe, Residential and Commercial, and APMEA. For one reporting unit, Heating and Hot Water Solutions ( HHWS\u201d), we performed a quantitative analysis.\nThe change in organic net sales by channel in the Americas and APMEA excluded divested sales for both periods presented.\nThe increase in net sales from acquisitions in APMEA was related to the fourth quarter 2015 acquisition of Apex and the first quarter 2016 acquisition of Watts Korea. The increase in net sales from acquisitions in the Americas was related to the acquisition of PVI in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense decreased $1.7 million, or 7%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to the retirement in April 2016 of a $225 million higher interest bearing private placement note that was replaced by $230 million drawn on our line of credit. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nOn February 12, 2016, we terminated our prior Credit Agreement and entered into a new Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company who became borrowers under the Credit Agreement, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and Letter of Credit Issuer, and the other lenders referred to therein. The Credit Agreement provides for a $500 million, five-year, senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) with a sublimit of up to $100 million in letters of credit. The Credit Agreement also provided for a $300 million, five-year, term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility\u201d) available to us in a single draw. The Credit Agreement matures on February 12, 2021, subject to extension under certain circumstances and subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2017, we had $277.5 million of borrowings outstanding on the term loan and $147.0 million drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility; had $25.7 million of stand-by letters of credit outstanding and had $327.3 million of unused and available credit under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants related to the Credit Agreement.\nIn certain countries, additional inventory reserves are maintained for potential shrinkage experienced in the manufacturing process. The reserve is established based on the prior year's inventory losses adjusted for any change in the gross inventory balance.\nWe used $205.3 million of net cash from financing activities in 2017 primarily due to payments of long-term debt of $178.0 million, dividend payments of $25.9 million, and payments to repurchase approximately 278,000 shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $18.2 million. This was partially offset by proceeds from an additional draw on our line of credit of $20.0 million during 2017.\nOperating income in 2016 of $145.0 million increased by $235.1 million compared to 2015. This increase is primarily related to the $129.7 million goodwill impairment charge in the Europe reporting unit, the 2015 settlement charge of $64.7 million for certain long-term obligations, including our pension plan and supplemental employee retirement plan, $16.7 million less in restructuring costs recognized in 2016 compared to 2015, as well as the $6.0 million charge to settle legacy product liability claims in 2015. We also recognized a gain of $8.7 million in the second quarter of 2016 on the disposition of a subsidiary in China. The remaining $9.3 million increase was due to favorable sales mix, favorable sourcing, and productivity.\n 1) A review of the most recent fair value calculation to identify the extent of the cushion between fair value and carrying amount, to determine if a substantial cushion existed. \nThe change in operating income was attributable to the following:\nOrganic sales is a non-GAAP measure that excludes the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. Divested sales includes the exit of our non-core products through sale and through the discontinuation of product lines. Management believes reporting organic sales growth provides useful information to investors, potential investors and others, because it allows for a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. We reconcile the change in organic sales to our reported sales for each region within our results below.\nThe increase in gross margin percentage is attributable to increased volume, manufacturing productivity, changes to our product mix, and incremental savings from our transformation and restructuring programs primarily within the Americas and Europe.\nWorking capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) as of December 31, 2017 was $456.2 million compared to $393.9 million as of December 31, 2016. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.4 to 1 as of December 31, 2017 compared to 1.9 to 1 as of December 31, 2016. The increase in working capital is primarily related to more cash generated from operations, as well as less cash used for purchases of capital equipment and repurchases of common stock in 2017.\nWe are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as determining the Toll Tax, remeasuring our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act, we have made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 118), which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. As we collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS or other standard-setting bodies, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts. Those adjustments may materially impact the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period or periods in which the adjustments are made. The accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act will be completed in 2018.\nWe are a leading supplier of products and solutions that conserve water and manage the flow of fluids and energy into, through and out of buildings in the residential and commercial markets of the Americas, Europe and APMEA. For over 140 years, we have designed and produced valve systems that safeguard and regulate water systems, energy efficient heating and hydronic systems, drainage systems and water filtration technology that helps conserve water. We earn revenue and income almost exclusively from the sale of our products. Our principal product lines include:\nWe believe that the income approach is sensitive to the selected discount rate and the market approach is sensitive to valuation multiples used. We use third-party valuation specialists to help develop the appropriate discount rate and valuation multiples. We use standard valuation practices to arrive at a weighted average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d) based on the market and guideline public companies. The higher the discount rate, the lower the discounted cash flows. While we believe that our estimate of future cash flows and market approach valuations are reasonable, different assumptions could significantly affect our valuation and result in impairments in the future.\nOn December 16, 2016, Watts International Holdings Limited ( Watts International\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Facility Agreement (the Facility Agreement\u201d) among Watts International, as original borrower and original guarantor, Watts Water Technologies EMEA B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ( Watts EMEA\u201d), as original guarantor, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as sole bookrunner and sole lead arranger ( JP Morgan Chase Bank\u201d), J.P. Morgan Europe Limited, as agent to the financial parties, and the other lenders referred to therein. The Facility Agreement provides for a \u20ac110 million, 364 day, term loan facility available to the Company in a single draw. On December 20, 2016, Watts International borrowed the full amount available for borrowing under the Facility Agreement. The loan made on December 20, 2016 bears interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) the Euro InterBank Offered Rate (EURIBOR), provided that if such rate is less than zero, then EURIBOR shall be deemed to be zero, plus (ii) a margin of 1.875%, provided that if no event of default is continuing and Watts International's consolidated leverage ratio is at a specified level, the margin shall decrease to 1.50%. Accrued interest on the loan is payable on the last day of each interest period. The first interest period is set at one month and may be changed subsequently to a period of one, two, or three months (or such other period agreed with all the lenders). Substantially all of the proceeds of the borrowings made on December 20, 2016 under the Facility Agreement were used to pay down $113 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of the third quarter of 2017, the Company had repaid in full the Facility Agreement.\naddition, we may choose to opportunistically return cash to shareholders and pursue other business initiatives, including acquisition activities. We may, from time to time, also seek additional funding through a combination of equity and debt financings should we identify a significant new opportunity.\n\n \u00b7 A market risk premium that is determined, in part, through published historical studies adjusted for the business risk index for the reporting unit. The business risk index is derived from comparable companies and measures the estimated stock price volatility. \nOrganic net sales in the Americas increased $7.7 million compared to 2015 primarily due to growth in our wholesale markets and OEM channels, particularly relating to backflow, valve, and drainage products.\nGross Profit. Gross profit and gross profit as a percent of net sales (gross margin) for 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\nThe change in net sales was attributable to the following:\nOrganic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth that excludes the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from period-over-period comparisons. A reconciliation to the most closely related U.S.GAAP measure, net sales, has been included in our discussion within Results of Operations\u201d above. Organic net sales should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to net sales. Management believes reporting organic sales growth provides useful information to investors, potential investors and others, by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods.\nGoodwill and Other Long-Lived Asset Impairment Charges. In 2016, we recorded impairment charges of $0.5 million, primarily related to an indefinite lived tradename in the Europe reporting unit. In 2015, we recorded impairment charges of $130.5 million, primarily relating to a $129.7 million goodwill impairment charge in the Europe reporting unit. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these impairments.\nOperating Income (loss). Operating income (loss) by geographic segment for 2016 and 2015 was as follows:\n\nA discussion of recent accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe total pre-tax cost for our transformation program related to our Americas and APMEA businesses was $59.8 million, including restructuring costs of $18.1 million, goodwill and intangible asset impairments of $13.5 million and other transformation and deployment costs of approximately $28.3 million. The other transformation and deployment costs included consulting and project management fees, inventory write-offs, and other associated costs. The program originally included estimated pre-tax charges totaling approximately $65 million. In the third quarter of 2017, the total expected costs of the planned actions were reduced to approximately $60 million, primarily related to reduced expected facility exit costs and reduced other transformation and deployment costs. All costs associated with the Americas and APMEA transformation program were incurred as of December 31, 2017. Refer to Note 3 and Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n \u00b7 Water quality products-includes point-of-use and point-of-entry water filtration, conditioning and scale prevention systems for both commercial and residential applications. \ngoal is to be a solutions provider, not merely a components supplier. We continually look for strategic opportunities to invest in new products and markets or divest existing product lines where necessary in order to meet those objectives.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants related to the Credit Agreement.\n (a) as recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. \nA reconciliation of long-term debt (including current portion) to net debt and our net debt to capitalization ratio is provided below:\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe estimate and use our expected annual effective income tax rates to accrue income taxes. Effective tax rates are determined based on budgeted earnings before taxes, including our best estimate of permanent items that will affect the effective rate for the year. Management periodically reviews these rates with outside tax advisors and changes are made if material variances from expectations are identified.\n \u00b7 Comparable company and market interest rate information used to the determine the cost of debt and the appropriate long-term capital structure in order to weight the cost of debt and the cost of equity into an overall WACC. \nOn September 22, 2015, we signed an agreement to sell an operating subsidiary in China that was dedicated to the production of non-core products. The sale was finalized in the second quarter of 2016, and we received total proceeds of approximately $8.4 million from the sale as of the fourth quarter of 2016. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $8.7 million, which includes a non-cash accumulated currency translation adjustment of $7.3 million. The net after-tax gain was approximately $8.3 million.\nIncome taxes\nAs of December 31, 2017, our actual financial ratios calculated in accordance with our Credit Agreement compared to the required levels under the Credit Agreement were as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2017, our actual fixed charge coverage ratio calculated in accordance with our senior note agreements compared to the required ratio therein was as follows:\nWe have made numerous acquisitions over the years and have recognized a significant amount of goodwill. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using an income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, and when appropriate, guideline public company and guideline transaction market approaches.\nOur free cash flow increased in 2017 when compared to the free cash flow for 2016 primarily due to an increase in cash flows provided by operations and lower capital investment spending in 2017, partially offset by the timing of working capital fluctuations compared to 2016.\nThe net increase in sales due to foreign exchange was primarily due to the appreciation of the euro and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar in 2017. We cannot predict whether foreign currencies will appreciate or depreciate against the U.S. dollar in future periods or whether future foreign exchange rate fluctuations will have a positive or negative impact on our net sales.\nProducts representing a majority of our sales are subject to regulatory standards and code enforcement, which typically require that these products meet stringent performance criteria. Together with our commissioned manufacturers' representatives, we have consistently advocated for the development and enforcement of such plumbing codes. We are focused on maintaining stringent quality control and testing procedures at each of our manufacturing facilities in order to manufacture products in compliance with code requirements and take advantage of the resulting demand for compliant products. We believe that the product development, product testing capability and investment in plant and equipment needed to manufacture products in compliance with code requirements, represent a competitive advantage for us.\nGoodwill and other intangibles\nIn 2015, we used $17.3 million of net cash for investing activities, including $20.4 million for the purchase of Apex and $27.7 million of cash for capital equipment, offset by cash proceeds of approximately $33.1 million for the sale of certain assets relating to divested product lines in the Americas.\nOn February 8, 2018, we declared a quarterly dividend of nineteen cents ($0.19) per share on each outstanding share of Class A common stock and Class B common stock payable on March 16, 2018 to stockholders of record on March 2, 2018.\n \u00b7 Residential & commercial flow control products-includes products typically sold into plumbing and hot water applications such as backflow preventers, water pressure regulators, temperature and pressure relief valves, and thermostatic mixing valves. \nCovenant compliance\nIn 2016, we generated $138.1 million of cash from operating activities as compared to $109.4 million in 2015. Cash flows from operating activities in 2015 included a $49.2 million settlement of certain long-term obligations, including pension obligations. We generated approximately $102.2 million of free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure, which we reconcile below, defined as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures plus proceeds from sale of assets), compared to free cash flow of $81.8 million in 2015.\nWe first identify those reporting units that we believe could pass a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. For each reporting unit identified, our qualitative analysis includes:\n\n\n\nA valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We consider estimated future taxable income and future reversals of the deferred tax liabilities in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\nIn 2016, we generated $27.7 million of net cash from financing activities as compared to $70.9 million of net cash used in 2015. The increase in cash generated is primarily due to net proceeds from long-term borrowings of $74.4 million and $17.8 million less in stock repurchases in 2016. We also received an additional $5.7 million in cash proceeds from share transactions under employee stock plans in 2016 compared to 2015.\nWe recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: (1) we have entered into a binding agreement, (2) the product has shipped and title has passed, (3) the sales price to the customer is fixed or is determinable and\nOperating Income (Loss). Operating income (loss) by geographic segment for 2017 and 2016 was as follows:\n2015 Cash Flows\nIn 2015, we generated $109.4 million of cash from operating activities as compared to $135.2 million in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the $49.2 million settlement of certain long-term obligations, including the pension plan, offset by inventory reduction efforts and stronger accounts receivable collections. We generated approximately $81.8 million of free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure, which we reconcile below, defined as net cash provided by continuing operating activities minus capital expenditures plus proceeds from sale of assets).\n\n\nOverall, reported sales for 2017 increased 4.2%, or $58.3 million, primarily related to an increase in acquired sales of $47.0 million, or 3.3%, relating to the acquisitions of PVI and Watts Korea, an increase in organic sales of $7.0 million, or 0.5%, and an increase in sales due to foreign exchange of $7.8 million, or 0.7%.This increase was partially offset by a decrease in sales of $3.5 million related to product lines we divested by the first quarter of 2016 in the Americas segment as part of our Americas transformation program. Compared to 2016, reported sales as a percentage of segment sales in the Americas and Europe increased by 5.6% and 2.1%, respectively, while reported sales in APMEA declined by 2.6%. As a percentage of segment sales, organic sales in the Americas and Europe increased 0.8% and 0.6% respectively, while organic sales in APMEA declined by 4.6% compared to 2016. The increase in organic sales in the Americas was primarily driven by increased sales in our valve, HVAC, and drainage products, partially offset by declines in our tankless water heater and condensing boiler products. In Europe, the increase was primarily driven by our drains and electronics products, offset by a decline in our plumbing products due to the impact of product rationalization. The decline in APMEA sales primarily related to the impact of product rationalization, partially offset by increased demand for our underfloor heating products and commercial valves and growth in Korea. Operating income of $162.3 million increased by $17.3 million, or 11.9% compared to 2016. This increase is driven by incremental transformation and productivity savings, lower transformation costs, the acquisition of PVI, and higher sales volume.\nWe have one senior note agreement as further detailed in Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report Form 10-K. This senior note agreement requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of consolidated EBITDA plus consolidated rent expense during the period to consolidated fixed charges. Consolidated fixed charges are the sum of consolidated interest expense for the period and consolidated rent expense.\nExcept for operating lease commitments, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nGain on disposition. In the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $8.7 million related to the sale of a China subsidiary that was dedicated to the production of non-core products and part of the transformation of our Americas and APMEA businesses. The pre-tax gain included a non-cash accumulated currency translation adjustment of $7.3 million.\n\n\nWe are a defendant in numerous legal matters including those involving environmental issues and product liability as discussed in more detail in Part I, Item 1. Business-Product Liability, Environmental and Other Litigation Matters.\u201d As required by GAAP, we determine whether an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and the loss amount can be reasonably estimated. When it is possible to estimate reasonably possible loss or range of loss above the amount accrued, that estimate is aggregated and disclosed. Estimates of potential outcomes of these contingencies are often developed in consultation with outside counsel. While this assessment is based upon all available information, litigation is inherently uncertain and the actual liability to fully resolve litigation cannot be predicted with any assurance of accuracy. In the event of an unfavorable outcome in one or more legal matters, the ultimate liability may be in excess of amounts currently accrued, if any, and may be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular quarterly or annual period. However, based on information currently known to us, management believes that the ultimate outcome of all legal contingencies, as they are resolved over time, is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, though the outcome could be material to our operating results for any particular period depending, in part, upon the operating results for such period.\n \u00b7 Drainage & water re-use products-includes drainage products and engineered rain water harvesting solutions for commercial, industrial, marine and residential applications. \nWe believe that the factors relating to our future growth include continued product innovation that meets the needs of our customers and our end markets; our ability to make selective acquisitions, both in our core markets as well as in new complementary markets; regulatory requirements relating to the quality and conservation of water and the safe use of water; increased demand for clean water; continued enforcement of plumbing and building codes; and a healthy economic environment. We have completed 10 acquisitions in the last decade. Our acquisition strategy focuses on businesses that promote our key macro themes around safety & regulation, energy efficiency and water conservation. We target businesses that will provide us with one or more of the following: an entry into new markets and/or new geographies, improved channel access, unique and/or proprietary technologies, advanced production capabilities or complementary solution offerings.\n \u00b7 A risk free rate based on the 20-year U.S. Treasury Bonds as of the assessment date. \nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with costs determined primarily on a first-in first-out basis. We utilize both specific product identification and historical product demand as the basis for determining our excess or obsolete inventory reserve. We identify all inventories that exceed a range of one to three years in sales. This is determined by comparing the current inventory balance against unit sales for the trailing twelve months. New products added to inventory within the past twelve months are excluded from this analysis. A portion of our products contain recoverable materials, therefore the excess and obsolete reserve is established net of any recoverable amounts. Changes in market conditions, lower-than- expected customer demand or changes in technology or features could result in additional obsolete inventory that is not saleable and could require additional inventory reserve provisions.\nGoodwill and Other Long-Lived Asset Impairment Charges. In 2017, we recorded an impairment of $1.0 million, primarily related to a technology asset in the Americas operating segment. In 2016, we recorded impairment charges of $0.5 million, primarily related to an indefinite lived tradename in the Europe operating segment. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these impairments.\nThe increase in net sales from acquisitions in the Americas and APMEA segments are related to the fourth quarter 2016 acquisition of PVI and the first quarter 2016 acquisition of Watts Korea, respectively.\nOrganic net sales in the APMEA wholesale market increased as compared to 2015 primarily due to strong demand for our underfloor heating products for residential applications as well as for our water and plumbing products outside of China.\nNew Accounting Standards\nIn addition to financial ratios, the Credit Agreement and senior note agreement contain affirmative and negative covenants that include limitations on disposition or sale of assets, prohibitions on assuming or incurring any liens on assets with limited exceptions and limitations on making investments other than those permitted by the agreements.\nNet Sales. Our business is reported in three geographic segments: Americas, Europe and APMEA. Our net sales in each of these segments for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nThe net decrease in sales due to foreign exchange was primarily due to the depreciation of the euro, Chinese yuan and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar in 2016. We cannot predict whether foreign currencies will appreciate or depreciate against the U.S. dollar in future periods or whether future foreign exchange rate fluctuations will have a positive or negative impact on our net sales.\nThe 2017 Tax Act was enacted on December 22, 2017 and introduces significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effective in 2018, the 2017 Tax Act reduces the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings and certain related-party payments, which are referred to as the global intangible low-taxed income tax and the base erosion tax, respectively. In addition, in 2017 we are subject to the Toll Tax, a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax. Accounting for the income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act requires significant judgments and estimates in the interpretation and calculations of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act.\n2017 Cash Flows\nThe change in organic net sales as a percentage of consolidated net sales and of segment net sales in the Americas and APMEA excluded divested sales for both periods presented.\nBecause of retention requirements associated with our insurance policies, we are generally self-insured for potential product liability claims. We are subject to a variety of potential liabilities in connection with product liability cases and we maintain a high self-insured retention limit within our product liability and general liability coverage, which we believe to be generally in accordance with industry practices. For product liability cases in the U.S., management establishes its product liability accrual, which includes legal costs associated with accrued claims, by utilizing third-party actuarial valuations which incorporate historical trend factors and our specific claims experience derived from loss reports provided by third-party administrators. The product liability accrual is established after considering any applicable insurance coverage. Changes in the nature of product liability claims, legal costs, or the actual settlement amounts could affect the adequacy of the estimates and require changes to the accrual. Because the liability is an estimate, the ultimate liability may be more or less than reported.\n(4) collectability is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue based upon a determination that all criteria for revenue recognition have been met, which, based on the majority of our shipping terms, is considered to have occurred upon shipment of the finished product. Some shipping terms require the goods to be received by the customer before title passes. In those instances, revenues are not recognized until the customer has received the goods. We record estimated reductions to revenue and a corresponding asset for customer returns and allowances and for customer programs. Provisions for returns and allowances are made at the time of sale, derived from historical trends and form a portion of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Customer programs, which are primarily annual volume incentive plans, allow customers to earn credit for attaining agreed upon purchase targets from us. We record estimated reductions to revenue, made at the time of sale, for customer programs based on estimated purchase targets.\nThe decrease in total net sales due to divested products of $98.0 million was a result of the exit of our low margin, non-core products beginning after the first quarter 2015 in our Americas and APMEA segments. Divested sales included the exit of our non-core products through sale and through the discontinuation of product lines.", "item_7_tables": "Table 57: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>
