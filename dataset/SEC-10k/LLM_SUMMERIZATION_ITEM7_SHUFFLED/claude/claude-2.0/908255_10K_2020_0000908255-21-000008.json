Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nINTRODUCTION\nBorgWarner Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries (the Company\u201d) is a global product leader in clean and efficient technology solutions for combustion, hybrid and electric vehicles. Our products help improve vehicle performance, propulsion efficiency, stability and air quality. These products are manufactured and sold worldwide, primarily to original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs\u201d) of light vehicles (passenger cars, sport-utility vehicles ( SUVs\u201d), vans and light trucks). The Company's products are also sold to other OEMs of commercial vehicles (medium-duty trucks, heavy-duty trucks and buses) and off-highway vehicles (agricultural and construction machinery and marine applications). We also manufacture and sell our products to certain Tier One vehicle systems suppliers and into the aftermarket for light, commercial and off-highway vehicles. The Company operates manufacturing facilities serving customers in Europe, the Americas and Asia and is an original equipment supplier to nearly every major automotive OEM in the world.\nAcquisition of Delphi Technologies PLC\nOn October 1, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of 100% of the outstanding ordinary shares of Delphi Technologies PLC ( Delphi Technologies\u201d) from the shareholders of Delphi Technologies pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Agreement, dated January 28, 2020, as amended on May 6, 2020, by and between the Company and Delphi Technologies (the Transaction Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Agreement, the Company issued, in exchange for each Delphi Technologies share, 0.4307 of a share of common stock of the Company and cash in lieu of any fractional share. In the aggregate, the Company delivered consideration of approximately $2.4 billion, including approximately 37 million shares of common stock of the Company, valued at $1.5 billion, repayment of approximately $900 million of Delphi Technologies' debt and stock-based compensation of approximately $15 million. Upon closing, the Company also assumed approximately $800 million in senior notes as discussed below. The acquisition is expected to strengthen the Company's electronics and power electronics products, capabilities and scale, position the Company for greater growth as electrified propulsion systems gain momentum and enhance key combustion, commercial vehicle and aftermarket product offerings.\nOn October 5, 2020, the Company completed its offer to exchange approximately $800 million in aggregate principal amount of Delphi Technologies' outstanding 5.000% Senior Notes due 2025 (the DT Notes\u201d). Approximately $776 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding DT Notes, representing 97% of the $800 million total outstanding principal amount of the DT Notes, were validly exchanged and cancelled for new BorgWarner notes. Following such cancellation, approximately $24 million in aggregate principal amount of the DT Notes remain outstanding. Since the majority of the DT Notes were exchanged, the Company was able to eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants and events of default not related to payment on the $800 million in outstanding senior notes of the Company.\nFollowing the Delphi Technologies acquisition, to align with the manner in which the business is viewed and managed subsequent to the acquisition, the Company reorganized its management reporting structure. Previously, the Company reported its results under two reporting segments, Engine and Drivetrain, which are now referred to as Air Management and e-Propulsion & Drivetrain, respectively. The former Delphi Technologies Powertrain Products segment was integrated into the Air Management segment and the former Delphi Technologies Electronics & Electrification segment was integrated into the e-Propulsion & Drivetrain segment. The remaining Delphi Technologies segments comprise two additional reporting segments, which are referred to as Fuel Injection and Aftermarket.\nResults of operations for Delphi Technologies are included in the Company's financial information following the date of acquisition on October 1, 2020.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Update\nTo date, COVID-19 has surfaced in nearly all regions around the world and has resulted, at times, in travel restrictions, closing of borders and business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas. Many OEMs temporarily suspended certain manufacturing operations, particularly in North America and Europe, due to market conditions and matters associated with COVID-19. Furthermore, COVID-19 has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The continued spread of COVID-19 has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which adversely impact the access to capital and increase the cost of capital.\nIn response to the outbreak and business disruption, we, first and foremost, prioritized the health and safety of our employees. As a global manufacturer, we have responded to shelter-in-place and similar government orders in various locations around the world, including throughout the United States and Europe. Additionally, our employees must respond to self-isolation and quarantine orders based on circumstances in their local communities, which continues to impact our facilities. The reopening procedures related to COVID-19 led to a number of employee safety measures upon reopening to contain the spread, including domestic and international travel restrictions, work-from-home practices, extensive cleaning protocols, social distancing guidelines, requirement for employees to wear masks and various temporary closures of or reduced operations at our manufacturing and assembly facilities.\nIn April 2020, we implemented a range of actions aimed at temporarily reducing costs and preserving liquidity. These actions included, but were not limited to:\n\u2022a temporary 20% reduction in base salaries of our senior executive leadership team and annual retainers of our non-employee directors;\n\u2022up to 10% temporary base pay reductions for other salaried employees; and\n\u2022reductions in discretionary spending, such as outside professional services and travel.\nEffective September 1, 2020, all of the base pay and annual retainer reductions had been eliminated.\nWe continue to monitor the evolving situation and guidance from international and domestic authorities, including federal, state and local public health authorities and may take additional actions based on their recommendations. In these circumstances, there may be developments outside our control requiring us to adjust our operating plan. To date, COVID-19 has had a material adverse impact on our revenue and overall profitability, primarily in the quarter ended June 30, 2020. Significant reductions in automotive or truck production have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on the Company's sales to OEMs. While production levels increased in the third and fourth quarters and revenue and profitability improved, COVID-19 continues to impact our business globally, and it is possible\nCOVID-19 could result in adverse impacts in the future. We cannot reasonably estimate the full impacts COVID-19 could have on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had liquidity of $3,650 million, comprised of cash and cash equivalent balances of $1,650 million and an undrawn revolving credit facility of $2,000 million. We were in full compliance with our covenants under the revolving credit facility and had full access to our undrawn revolving credit facility. Debt maturities through the end of 2021 total $45 million. Given our strong liquidity position, we believe that the Company will have sufficient liquidity and will maintain compliance with all covenants throughout the next 12 months.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nA detailed comparison of the Company's 2018 operating results to its 2019 operating results can be found in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section in the Company's 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed February 13, 2020.\nThe following table presents a summary of our operating results:\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except per share data) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of net sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of net sales </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Air Management </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,678 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>e-Propulsion & Drivetrain </td> <td>3,989 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fuel Injection </td> <td>479 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aftermarket </td> <td>194 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inter-segment eliminations </td> <td>(175) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(61) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net sales </td> <td>10,165 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,168 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales </td> <td>8,255 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,067 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td>1,910 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses -

During the three months ended December 31, 2020, the Delphi Technologies acquisition increased revenues by $1,120 million. Excluding this revenue, total net sales declined by 11% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Excluding the impact of weaker foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, and the net impact of the Delphi Technologies acquisition, net sales decreased approximately 11%, primarily due to COVID-19 related production slowdowns and shutdowns during the first six months of 2020, partially offset by stronger sales in China.\nCost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 81.2% and 79.3% in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cost of sales associated with Delphi Technologies for the three months ended December 31, 2020 was approximately $900 million. Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Delphi Technologies, cost of sales decreased primarily due to lower sales. The Company's material cost of sales was approximately 57% and 55% of net sales in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 18.8% and 20.7% in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The reduction of gross margin in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company took numerous steps to eliminate costs; however, certain fixed costs could not be reduced on a temporary basis, which led to a higher cost of sales as a percentage of sales as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, the $27 million related to the fair value adjustment of inventories acquired had an unfavorable impact on gross margin and, to a lesser extent, certain lower margin business related to the acquisition of Delphi Technologies.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A\u201d) was $951 million and $873 million, or 9.4% and 8.6% of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. SG&A increased as a result of the three months of activity related to Delphi Technologies following the acquisition on October 1, 2020. The increase related to Delphi Technologies was partially offset by savings and actions taken during the year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nResearch and development ( R&D\u201d) costs, net of customer reimbursements, were $476 million, or 4.7% of net sales, in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $413 million, or 4.1% of net sales, in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of R&D costs, net of customer reimbursements, in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to the acquisition of Delphi Technologies, which increased R&D costs by $66 million during the three months ended December 31, 2020. We will continue to invest in a number of cross-business R&D programs, as well as a number of other key programs, all of which are necessary for short- and long-term growth. Our current long-term expectation for R&D spending is in the range of 5.0% to 5.5% of net sales.\nRestructuring expense was $203 million and $72 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, primarily related to employee benefit costs. The increase in 2020 was primarily due to increased costs related to the announced closure of two facilities in Europe affecting approximately 550 employees and contractually required severance and stock-based compensation associated with the Delphi Technologies acquisition.\nIn February 2020, the Company announced a cost restructuring plan to address existing structural costs. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $148 million of restructuring expense related to this plan. These actions are expected to result in a total of $300 million of restructuring costs through 2022. The resulting annual gross savings is expected to be $90 million to $100 million and will be utilized to sustain overall operating margin profile and cost competitiveness. Nearly all of the restructuring charges are expected to be cash expenditures.\nIn April 2019, the Company announced a cost restructuring plan including several actions to reduce existing structural costs. These actions were primarily completed during fourth quarter 2019 and resulted\nin approximately $50 million of restructuring expense. The resulting annual gross cost reduction is expected to be in the range of $40 million to $50 million by 2021.\nThe Company recorded approximately $54 million in restructuring during the three months ended December 31, 2020, related to legacy Delphi Technologies. In conjunction with the acquisition, there were contractually required severance and post-combination stock-based compensation cash payments to legacy Delphi Technologies executive officers and other employee termination benefits. Additionally, in 2019, legacy Delphi Technologies announced a restructuring plan to reshape and realign its global technical center footprint and reduce salaried and contract staff, with expected charges of up to $175 million. Certain of these actions are subject to consultation with employee works councils and other employee representatives. The majority of these actions are expected to be completed by the end of 2021. Nearly all of the restructuring charges are expected to be cash expenditures.\nOther operating expense (income), net - other represents items other than restructuring expense and was expense of $138 million and income of $147 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nIn this line item for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is merger, acquisition and divestiture expense of $96 million and $11 million, respectively. The increase in 2020 was primarily related to professional fees associated with the acquisition of Delphi Technologies completed on October 1, 2020.\nAs a result of an evaluation of the underlying technologies and management of the business subsequent to the acquisition of Delphi Technologies, the Company reduced the useful life of certain intangible assets during the fourth quarter of 2020 as they no longer provided future economic benefit. This resulted in accelerated amortization expense of $38 million recorded within this line item.\nIn addition, the year ended December 31, 2019 included a pre-tax gain of $177 million related to the derecognition of BorgWarner Morse TEC LLC ( Morse TEC\u201d), which was a consolidated wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company that held asbestos and certain other liabilities and was the policyholder of the related insurance assets. Also related to this matter, the Company recorded tax expense as a result of the reversal of the previously recorded deferred tax assets related to the asbestos liabilities of $173 million, resulting in an after-tax gain of $4 million. Refer to Note 21, Contingencies,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information.\nThis line item is primarily comprised of operating expense (income) items discussed within the subtitle Non-comparable items impacting the Company's earnings per diluted share and net earnings\u201d below.\nEquity in affiliates' earnings, net of tax was $18 million and $32 million in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. This line item is driven by the results of our unconsolidated joint ventures, NSK-Warner K.K., Turbo Energy Private Limited ( TEL\u201d) and Delphi-TVS Diesel Systems Ltd. The decrease in equity in affiliates' earnings in the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to lower industry volumes and cost pressures in a reduced market.\nUnrealized gain on equity securities was $382 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This line item reflects the net unrealized gain recognized during 2020 related to the Company's equity securities in Romeo Systems, Inc. (now known as Romeo Power, Inc.) which became a public company in December 2020. For further details, see Note 2, Acquisitions,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nInterest expense was $73 million and $55 million in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to the Company's issuance of $1.1 billion senior notes in June 2020 and the $800 million DT Notes acquired as part of the Delphi Technologies acquisition.\nProvision for income taxes the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 41.2% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with the rate of 37.1% for the year ended December 31, 2019. For further details, see Note 7, Income Taxes,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nThe effective tax rate was approximately 41% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Unfavorably impacting the effective tax rate in 2020 was income tax expense related to final U.S. Department of Treasury regulations issued in the third quarter of 2020, that impacted the net tax on remittance of foreign earnings and certain tax law changes in India effective in the first quarter of 2020. In addition, we recognized incremental valuation allowances of $53 million in 2020. Also unfavorably impacting the effective tax rate were certain restructuring expenses and merger and acquisition related transaction costs that were non-deductible for tax purposes. Excluding the impact of non-comparable items, the Company's annual effective tax rate associated with ongoing operations was 32% for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe effective tax rate was approximately 37% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The effective tax rate for 2019 included an increase in income tax expense of $173 million related to the derecognition of the Morse TEC asbestos-related deferred tax assets and $22 million due to the U.S. Department of the Treasury's issuance of the final regulations in the first quarter of 2019 related to the calculation of the one-time transition tax. The 2019 effective tax rate also included reductions of income tax expense of $19 million related to restructuring expense, $11 million for a global realignment plan, $8 million related to other one-time adjustments and $6 million related to pension settlement loss. Excluding the impact of non-comparable items, the Company's annual effective tax rate was 26% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNet earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest, net of tax of $67 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $16 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due to growth in sales in China, resulting in increased profit in joint ventures and the addition of noncontrolling interests from the Delphi Technologies acquisition.\nNon-comparable items impacting the Company's earnings per diluted share and net earnings\nThe Company's earnings per diluted share were $2.34 and $3.61 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The non-comparable items presented below are calculated after tax using the corresponding effective tax rate and the weighted average number of diluted shares for each of the years then ended. The Company believes the following table is useful in highlighting non-comparable items that impacted its earnings per diluted share:\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-comparable items: </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.86) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.26) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merger, acquisition and divestiture expense1\n</td> <td>(0.38) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.05) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intangible asset accelerated amortization2\n</td> <td>(0.14) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of inventory fair value adjustment3\n</td> <td>(0.10) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairment and loss on divestiture4\n</td> <td>(0.08) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.03) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain on insurance recovery for property damage5\n</td> <td>0.04 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unfavorable arbitration loss6\n</td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.07) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Officer stock awards modification </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.01) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on derecognition of subsidiary7\n</td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.02 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized gain on equity securities8\n</td> <td>1.36 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Delayed-draw term loan cancellation9\n</td> <td>(0.01) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension settlement loss10\n</td> <td>(0.02) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.10) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax adjustments11\n</td> <td>(0.23) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.02) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total impact of non-comparable items per share - diluted: </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.42) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.52) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1 </td> <td>During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded merger, acquisition and divestiture expense of $96 million primarily for professional fees associated with the Company's acquisition of Delphi Technologies completed on October 1, 2020.

ROIC is comprised of Segment Adjusted EBIT after deducting notional taxes compared to the projected average capital investment required. Segment Adjusted EBIT is comprised of earnings before interest, income taxes and noncontrolling interest ( EBIT\u201d) adjusted for restructuring, goodwill impairment charges, affiliates' earnings and other items not reflective of ongoing operating income or loss. Segment Adjusted EBIT excludes certain corporate costs which primarily represents headquarters' expenses not directly attributable to the individual segments. Corporate expenses not allocated to Segment Adjusted EBIT were $192 million and $206 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. An increase in corporate expenses related to the acquisition of Delphi Technologies in 2020 was more than offset by savings and actions taken during the year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including decreased compensation expense, resulting in a decrease compared to 2019.\nSegment Adjusted EBIT is the measure of segment income or loss used by the Company. The Company believes Segment Adjusted EBIT is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our reporting segments. The following table shows Segment Adjusted EBIT for the Company's reporting segments.\nSegment Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes and Noncontrolling Interest ( Segment Adjusted EBIT\u201d)\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>% margin </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% margin </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Air Management </td> <td>$ </td> <td>762 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>995 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>e-Propulsion & Drivetrain </td> <td>359 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>443 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fuel Injection </td> <td>39 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>n/a </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aftermarket </td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>n/a </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Adjusted EBIT </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,182 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,438 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Air Management segment's net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $536 million, or 8.6%, and Segment Adjusted EBIT decreased $233 million, or 23.4%, from the year ended December 31, 2019. The Delphi Technologies acquisition increased Air Management revenues by $312 million in 2020. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and of strengthening foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, net sales decreased 13.5% from the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in sales was due to COVID-19 related production slowdowns and shutdowns during the first six months of 2020, partially offset by growing demand for the Company's products. The Segment Adjusted EBIT margin was 13.4% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 16.0% in the year ended December 31, 2019. The Segment Adjusted EBIT margin decrease was primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of increased warranty costs.\nThe e-Propulsion & Drivetrain segment's net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $26 million, or 0.6%, and Segment Adjusted EBIT decreased $84 million, or 19.0%, from the year ended December 31, 2019. The Delphi Technologies acquisition increased e-Propulsion & Drivetrain revenues by $255 million in 2020. Excluding the net impact of the acquisition and of strengthening foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, net sales decreased 7.2% from the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in sales was due to COVID-19 related production slowdowns and shutdowns during the first six months of 2020, which was partially offset by growing demand for the Company's products and stronger\nsales in China. The Segment Adjusted EBIT margin was 9.0% in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 11.0% in the year ended December 31, 2019. The Segment Adjusted EBIT margin decrease was primarily due to the impact of lower net sales, higher research and development spending and to a lesser extent the impact of the Delphi Technologies acquisition, during the three months ended December 31, 2020.\nThe Fuel Injection segment's net sales and Segment Adjusted EBIT for the three months December 31, 2020 were $479 million and $39 million, respectively. The Segment Adjusted EBIT margin was 8.1% in the three months ended December 31, 2020. This is a new reporting segment following the acquisition of Delphi Technologies on October 1, 2020.\nThe Aftermarket segment's net sales and Segment Adjusted EBIT for the three months ended December 31, 2020 were $194 million and $22 million, respectively. The Segment Adjusted EBIT margin was 11.3% in the three months ended December 31, 2020. This is a new reporting segment following the acquisition of Delphi Technologies on October 1, 2020.\nOutlook\nOur overall outlook for 2021 is positive. The Company expects global industry production to increase year over year due to the negative effects of COVID-19 on 2020 production not recurring in 2021. The Company expects net new business-related sales growth, due to increased penetration of BorgWarner products around the world, to drive a sales increase in line with or greater than the year-over-year increase in industry production. As result, the Company expects increasing revenue in 2021, excluding the impact of foreign currencies and the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. The Company maintains a positive long-term outlook for its global business and is committed to new product development and strategic capital investments to enhance its product leadership strategy.\nThere are several trends that are driving the Company's long-term growth that we expect to continue, including adoption of product offerings for electrified vehicles, increasingly stringent global emissions standards that support demand for the Company's products driving vehicle efficiency and increased global penetration of all-wheel drive.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe Company maintains various liquidity sources including cash and cash equivalents and the unused portion of our multi-currency revolving credit agreement. At December 31, 2020, the Company had $1,650 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which $1,088 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our subsidiaries outside of the United States. Cash and cash equivalents held by these subsidiaries is used to fund foreign operational activities and future investments, including acquisitions.\nThe vast majority of cash and cash equivalents held outside the United States is available for repatriation. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred. As of January 1, 2018, funds repatriated from foreign subsidiaries are generally no longer taxable for U.S. federal tax purposes. In light of the treatment of foreign earnings under the Tax Act, the Company recorded a liability for the U.S. federal and applicable state income tax liabilities calculated under the provisions of the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. A deferred tax liability has been recorded for substantially all estimated legally distributable foreign earnings. The Company uses its U.S. liquidity primarily for various corporate purposes, including but not limited to debt service, share repurchases, dividend distributions, acquisitions and divestitures and other corporate expenses.\nOn March 13, 2020, the Company amended its multi-currency revolving credit facility, by increasing the size of the facility from $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion and by extending the maturity until March 13, 2025.\nThe multi-currency revolving credit agreement automatically increased to $2.0 billion upon the closing of the acquisition of Delphi Technologies on October 1, 2020. Additionally, the agreement allows the Company the ability to increase the facility by $1.0 billion with bank group approval. The credit agreement contains customary events of default and one key financial covenant, which is a debt-to-EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. The Company was in compliance with the financial covenant at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under this facility.\nThe Company's commercial paper program allows the Company to issue $2.0 billion of short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes under the limits of its multi-currency revolving credit facility. The commercial paper program automatically increased to $2.0 billion upon the closing of the acquisition of Delphi Technologies on October 1, 2020. Under this program, the Company may issue notes from time to time and use the proceeds for general corporate purposes. The Company had no outstanding borrowings under this program as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nThe total current combined borrowing capacity under the multi-currency revolving credit facility and commercial paper program cannot exceed $2.0 billion.\nIn addition to the credit facility, the Company's universal shelf registration provides the ability to issue various debt and equity instruments subject to market conditions.\nOn February 12, 2020, April 29, 2020, July 29, 2020 and November 11, 2020, the Company's Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.17 per share of common stock. These dividends were paid on March 16, 2020, June 15, 2020, September 15, 2020 and December 15, 2020, respectively.\nFrom a credit quality perspective, the Company had a credit rating of BBB+ from both Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings and Baa1 from Moody's as of December 31, 2019, with a stable outlook from all rating agencies. On January 28, 2020, the Company entered into the agreement to acquire Delphi Technologies. During 2020, due to the recent business disruptions from COVID-19 and uncertainties surrounding the Delphi Technologies acquisition, Standard & Poor's downgraded the Company's rating from BBB+ with a stable outlook to BBB with a negative outlook. Additionally, Moody's and Fitch adjusted their outlooks from stable to negative but have maintained the Company's credit ratings at Baa1 and BBB+, respectively. None of the Company's debt agreements require accelerated repayment in the event of a downgrade in credit ratings.\nCash Flows\nOperating Activities\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OPERATING </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earnings </td> <td>$ </td> <td>567 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>797 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments to reconcile net earnings to net cash flows from operations: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash charges (credits) to operations: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>568 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>439 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring expense, net of cash paid </td> <td>135 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense </td> <td>41 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairment and loss on divestiture </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension settlement loss </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized gain on equity securities </td> <td>(382) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred income tax provision </td> <td>123 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on insurance recovery received for property damages </td> <td>(9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax reform adjustments to provision for income taxes </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pre-tax gain on derecognition of subsidiary </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(177) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other non-cash adjustments </td> <td>(17) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earnings adjusted for non-cash charges to operations </td> <td>1,047 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,367 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retirement plan contributions </td> <td>(182) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(38) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derecognition of a subsidiary </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(172) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in assets and liabilities </td> <td>319 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(149) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,184 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,008 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1,184 million and $1,008 million in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to 2019 cash outflows related to the 2019 derecognition of Morse TEC, a former wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, that held asbestos and certain other liabilities, which included a contribution by the Company to Morse TEC of approximately $172 million. During 2020, there were lower net investments in working capital (excluding working capital acquired in the Delphi Technologies acquisition), partially offset by incremental retirement benefit plan contributions made in December 2020 to the the Delphi Technologies Pension Scheme in the United Kingdom, which is discussed further below.\nInvesting Activities\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>INVESTING </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures, including tooling outlays </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(441) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(481) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance proceeds received for damage to property, plant and equipment </td> <td>20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures for damage to property, plant and equipment </td> <td>(20) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payments for investments in equity securities </td> <td>(2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(53) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payments for businesses acquired, net of cash acquired </td> <td>(449) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from sale of businesses, net of cash divested </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from settlement of net investment hedges, net </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from asset disposals and other, net </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(866) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(489) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash used in investing activities was $866 million and $489 million in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Refer to Note 18, Retirement Benefit Plans,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for disclosures related to the Company's pension benefits.\nWe believe that the combination of cash from operations, cash balances, available credit facilities, and the universal shelf registration capacity will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for our current level of operations and our planned operations for the foreseeable future. We will continue to balance our needs for internal growth, external growth, debt reduction and cash conservation.\nPension and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits\nThe Company's policy is to fund its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with applicable government regulations and to make additional contributions when appropriate. At December 31, 2020, all legal funding requirements had been met. The Company contributed $174 million, $26 million and $26 million to its defined benefit pension plans in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. On October 1, 2020, as a result of the acquisition of Delphi Technologies, the Company assumed all of the retirement-related liabilities of Delphi Technologies, the most significant of which is the Delphi Technologies Pension Scheme (the Scheme\u201d) in the United Kingdom. On December 12, 2020, the Company entered into a Heads of Terms Agreement (the Agreement\u201d) with the Trustees of the Scheme related to the future funding of the Scheme. Under the Agreement, the Company eliminated the prior schedule of contributions between Delphi Technologies and the Scheme in exchange for a $137 million (\u00a3100 million) one-time contribution into the Scheme Plan by December 31, 2020, which was paid on December 15, 2020. The Agreement also contained other provisions regarding the implementation of a revised asset investment strategy as well as a funding progress test that will be performed every three years to determine if additional contributions need to be made into the Scheme by the Company. At this time, the Company anticipates that no additional contributions will be made into the Scheme until 2026 at the earliest.\nThe Company expects to contribute a total of $20 million to $30 million into its defined benefit pension plans during 2021. Of the $20 million to $30 million in projected 2021 contributions, $6 million are contractually obligated, while any remaining payments would be discretionary.\nThe funded status of all pension plans was a net unfunded position of $501 million and $212 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Of these amounts, $139 million and $107 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were related to plans in Germany, where there is no tax deduction allowed under the applicable regulations to fund the plans; hence, the common practice is to\nmake contributions as benefit payments become due. Additionally, $186 million of the net unfunded position at December 31, 2020 relates to the acquired Delphi Technologies Pension Scheme in the United Kingdom, which includes the $137 million contribution as discussed above.\nOther postretirement employee benefits primarily consist of postretirement health care benefits for certain employees and retirees of the Company's U.S. operations. The Company funds these benefits as retiree claims are incurred. Other postretirement employee benefits had an unfunded status of $65 million and $81 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe Company believes it will be able to fund the requirements of these plans through cash generated from operations or other available sources of financing for the foreseeable future.\nRefer to Note 18, Retirement Benefit Plans,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits.\nOTHER MATTERS\nContingencies\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is party to various commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints, including matters involving warranty claims, intellectual property claims, general liability and various other risks. It is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the Company will ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal matters or, if not, what the impact might be. The Company's environmental and product liability contingencies are discussed separately below. The Company's management does not expect that an adverse outcome in any of these commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows, although it could be material to the results of operations in a particular quarter.\nEnvironmental\nThe Company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties ( PRPs\u201d) at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ( Superfund\u201d) and equivalent state laws and, as such, may presently be liable for the cost of clean-up and other remedial activities at 26 such sites. Responsibility for clean-up and other remedial activities at a Superfund site is typically shared among PRPs based on an allocation formula.\nThe Company believes that none of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Generally, this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not material or the liability will be shared with other PRPs, although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter.\nRefer to Note 21, Contingencies,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for further details and information respecting the Company's environmental liability.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). In preparing these financial statements, management\nhas made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management makes estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, relating to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our most critical accounting policies are discussed below.\nBusiness combinations The Company allocates the cost of an acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess value of the cost of an acquired business over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. The valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results. The Company uses a variety of information sources to determine the value of acquired assets and liabilities including: third-party appraisers for the values and lives of property, identifiable intangibles and inventories; and actuaries for defined benefit retirement plans. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units as of the date of the related acquisition. If goodwill is assigned to more than one reporting unit, the Company utilizes a method that is consistent with the manner in which the amount of goodwill in a business combination is determined. Costs related to the acquisition of a business are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of acquired customer relationships using the multi-period excess earnings method. Value is estimated as the present value of the benefits anticipated from ownership of the asset, in excess of the returns required on the investment in contributory assets which are necessary to realize those benefits. The intangible asset's estimated earnings are determined as the residual earnings after quantifying estimated earnings from contributory assets. Assumptions used in these calculations are considered from a market participant perspective and include revenue growth rates, estimated earnings, contributory asset charges, customer attrition and discount rates.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of trade names and developed technology using the relief from royalty method, which calculates the cost savings associated with owning rather than licensing the assets. Assumed royalty rates are applied to projected revenue for the remaining useful lives of the assets to estimate the royalty savings. Assumptions in the determination of the fair value of the developed technology included revenue growth rates, royalty rates, obsolescence factors and discount rates. Assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of the trade name included the revenue growth rates, the royalty rate and discount rate.\nWhile the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions, fair value estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Any adjustments required after the measurement period are recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings.\nFuture changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our acquisition valuations and intangible asset and goodwill impairment testing, including discount rates or future operating results and related cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values in the future. An increase in discount rates, a reduction in projected cash flows or a combination of the two could lead to a reduction in the estimated fair values, which may result in impairment charges that could materially affect our financial statements in any given year.\nImpairment of long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets The Company reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets, whether held for use or disposal, including other amortizing intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review under ASC Topic\n360. In assessing long-lived assets for an impairment loss, assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. In assessing long-lived assets for impairment, management generally considers individual facilities the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent. A recoverability review is performed using the undiscounted cash flows if there is a triggering event. If the undiscounted cash flow test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment, management will perform a fair value analysis. Management determines fair value under ASC Topic 820 using the appropriate valuation technique of market, income or cost approach. If the carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.\nManagement believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable; however, changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect the valuations. Significant judgments and estimates used by management when evaluating long-lived assets for impairment include: (i) an assessment as to whether an adverse event or circumstance has triggered the need for an impairment review; (ii) undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset; and (iii) fair valuation of the asset. Events and conditions that could result in impairment in the value of our long-lived assets include changes in the industries in which we operate, particularly the impact of a downturn in the global economy, as well as competition and advances in technology, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, or other factors leading to reduction in expected long-term sales or profitability.\nGoodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets During the fourth quarter of each year, the Company qualitatively assesses its goodwill assigned to each of its reporting units. This qualitative assessment evaluates various events and circumstances, such as macro-economic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, relevant events and financial trends, that may impact a reporting unit's fair value. Using this qualitative assessment, the Company determines whether it is more-likely-than-not the reporting unit's fair value exceeds its carrying value. If it is determined that it is not more-likely-than-not the reporting unit's fair value exceeds the carrying value, or upon consideration of other factors, including recent acquisition, restructuring or divestiture activity or to refresh the fair values, the Company performs a quantitative, step one,\u201d goodwill impairment analysis. In addition, the Company may test goodwill in between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.\nSimilar to goodwill, the Company can elect to perform the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (primarily trade names) using a qualitative analysis, considering similar factors as outlined in the goodwill discussion in order to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the trade names is less than the respective carrying values. If the Company elects to perform or is required to perform a quantitative analysis, the test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date. The Company estimates the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief-from-royalty method, which it believes is an appropriate and widely used valuation technique for such assets. The fair value derived from the relief-from-royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trade names and not being required to pay a royalty for their use.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company performed an analysis on each reporting unit. Following the acquisition of Delphi Technologies and the resulting reorganization of the business, the Company elected to perform quantitative, step one,\u201d goodwill impairment analyses for certain reporting units to refresh their respective fair values. This requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates. The basis of this goodwill impairment analysis is the Company's annual budget and long-range plan ( LRP\u201d). The annual budget and LRP includes a five-year projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments. Because the projections are estimated over a significant future period of time, those estimates and assumptions are subject to uncertainty. Further, the market valuation\nmodels and other financial ratios used by the Company require certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to the Company's facts and circumstances.\nThe Company believes the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair value are reasonable. Different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value. The primary assumptions affecting the Company's 2020 goodwill quantitative, step one,\u201d impairment review are as follows:\n\u2022Discount rate: the Company used a 11.7% weighted average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d) as the discount rate for future cash flows. The WACC is intended to represent a rate of return that would be expected by a market participant.\n\u2022Operating income margin: the Company used historical and expected operating income margins, which may vary based on the projections of the reporting unit being evaluated.\n\u2022Revenue growth rate: the Company used a global automotive market industry growth rate forecast adjusted to estimate its own market participation for product lines.\nIn addition to the above primary assumptions, the Company notes the following risks to volume and operating income assumptions that could have an impact on the discounted cash flow models:\n\u2022The automotive industry is cyclical, and the Company's results of operations would be adversely affected by industry downturns.\n\u2022The Company is dependent on market segments that use our key products and would be affected by decreasing demand in those segments.\n\u2022The Company is subject to risks related to international operations.\nBased on the assumptions outlined above, the impairment testing conducted in the fourth quarter of 2020 indicated the Company's goodwill assigned to the respective reporting units was not impaired. Future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates from those used in acquisition-related valuations and goodwill impairment testing, including discount rates or future operating results and related cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values in the future. An increase in discount rates, a reduction in projected cash flows or a combination of the two could lead to a reduction in the estimated fair values, which may result in impairment charges that could materially affect our financial statements in any given year.\nRefer to Note 12, Goodwill And Other Intangibles,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding goodwill.\nProduct warranties The Company provides warranties on some, but not all, of its products. The warranty terms are typically from one to three years. Provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold. These estimates are established using historical information about the nature, frequency and average cost of warranty claim settlements as well as product manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from third parties. Management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims. Management believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate; however, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to the accrual:\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,165 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,168 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Warranty provision </td> <td>$ </td> <td>105 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>72 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Warranty provision as a percentage of net sales </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of a 25 basis-point change (as a percentage of net sales) in the assumed warranty trend on the Company's accrued warranty liability:\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>25 basis point decrease (income)/expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(25) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(25) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>25 basis point increase (income)/expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2020, the total accrued warranty liability was $253 million. The accrual is represented as $164 million in current liabilities and $89 million in non-current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nRefer to Note 13, Product Warranty,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding product warranties.\nPension and other postretirement defined benefits The Company provides postretirement defined benefits to a number of its current and former employees. Costs associated with postretirement defined benefits include pension and postretirement health care expenses for employees, retirees and surviving spouses and dependents.\nThe Company's defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 715. The determination of the Company's obligation and expense for its pension and other postretirement employee benefits, such as retiree health care, is dependent on certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. Certain assumptions, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rate, rates of increase in compensation and health care costs trends are described in Note 18, Retirement Benefit Plans,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. The effects of any modification to those assumptions are either recognized immediately or amortized over future periods in accordance with GAAP.\nIn accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from assumptions used are accumulated and generally amortized over future periods. The primary assumptions affecting the Company's accounting for employee benefits under ASC Topics 712 and 715 as of December 31, 2020 are as follows:\n\u2022Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets: The expected long-term rate of return is used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost. The required use of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year. Over time, however, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is designed to approximate actual earned long-term returns. The expected long-term rate of return for pension assets has been determined based on various inputs, including historical returns for the different asset classes held by the Company's trusts and its asset allocation, as well as inputs from internal and external sources regarding expected capital market return, inflation and other variables. The Company also considers the impact of active management of the plans' invested assets. In determining its pension expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company used long-term rates of return on plan assets ranging from 1.5% to 7.7% outside of the U.S. and 6.0% in the U.S.\nActual returns on U.S. pension assets were 9.3% and 18.0% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 6.0% for the same years ended.\nActual returns on U.K. pension assets were 4.0% and 9.5% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 4.0% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 5% for the year ended in 2019.\nActual returns on German pension assets were 4.3% and 21.0% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 6.0% for the same years ended.\n\u2022Discount rate: The discount rate is used to calculate pension and other postretirement employee benefit ( OPEB\u201d) obligations. In determining the discount rate, the Company utilizes a full-yield approach in the estimation of service and interest components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. The Company used discount rates ranging from 0.48% to 12.50% to determine its pension and other benefit obligations as of December 31, 2020, including weighted average discount rates of 2.31% in the U.S., 1.44% outside of the U.S. (including 1.39% in the U.K.) and 1.93% for U.S. other postretirement health care plans. The U.S. and U.K. discount rates reflect the fact that the U.S. and U.K. pension plans have been closed for new participants.\n\u2022Health care cost trend: For postretirement employee health care plan accounting, the Company reviews external data and Company-specific historical trends for health care cost to determine the health care cost trend rate assumptions. In determining the projected benefit obligation for postretirement employee health care plans as of December 31, 2020, the Company used health care cost trend rates of 6.50%, declining to an ultimate trend rate of 4.75% by the year 2025.\nWhile the Company believes that these assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the Company's pension and OPEB and its future expense.\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for Company sponsored U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans on its 2021 pre-tax pension expense:\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td>Impact on U.S. 2021 pre-tax pension (expense)/income </td> <td> </td> <td>Impact on Non-U.S. 2021 pre-tax pension (expense)/income </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>25 basis point decrease in discount rate </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>25 basis point increase in discount rate </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>25 basis point decrease in expected return on assets </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>25 basis point increase in expected return on assets </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in discount rate for Company sponsored U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans on its pension obligations:\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td>Impact on U.S. PBO </td> <td> </td> <td>Impact on Non-U.S. PBO </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>25 basis point decrease in discount rate </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>124 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>25 basis point increase in discount rate </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(115) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the Company's total 2021 U.S. OPEB expense is expected to be negligible, as any increase in interest expense will be offset by net actuarial gains.\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity to a 25 basis-point change in the assumed health care cost trend related to the Company's OPEB obligation and service and interest cost:\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>25 Basis Point </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td>Increase </td> <td> </td> <td>Decrease </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect on other postretirement employee benefit obligation </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect on total service and interest cost components </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRefer to Note 18, Retirement Benefit Plans,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding the Company's retirement benefit plans.\nRestructuring Restructuring costs may occur when the Company takes action to exit or significantly curtail a part of its operations or implements a reorganization that affects the nature and focus of operations. A restructuring charge can consist of severance costs associated with reductions to the workforce, costs to terminate an operating lease or contract, professional fees and other costs incurred related to the implementation of restructuring activities.\nThe Company generally records costs associated with voluntary separations at the time of employee acceptance. Costs for involuntary separation programs are recorded when management has approved the plan for separation, the employees are identified and aware of the benefits they are entitled to and it is unlikely that the plan will change significantly. When a plan of separation requires approval by or consultation with the relevant labor organization or government, the costs are recorded upon agreement. Costs associated with benefits that are contingent on the employee continuing to provide service are accrued over the required service period.\nIncome taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.\nAccounting for income taxes is complex, in part because the Company conducts business globally and therefore files income tax returns in numerous tax jurisdictions. Management judgment is required in determining the Company's worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities, including accruals for unrecognized tax benefits. In calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis, the Company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial performance of the operation recording the net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information. Since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to the Company's valuation allowance may be necessary.\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. at the federal and state level and numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions. The determination of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits includes the application of complex tax laws in a multitude of jurisdictions across the Company's global operations. Management judgment is required in determining the accruals for unrecognized tax benefits. In the ordinary course of the Company's business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is less than certain. Accruals for unrecognized tax benefits are established when, despite the belief that tax positions are supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold, which is a tax position that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. The Company has certain U.S. state income tax returns and certain non-U.S. income tax returns which are currently under various stages of audit by applicable tax authorities. At December 31, 2019, the Company has a liability for tax positions the Company estimates are not more-likely-than-not to be sustained based on the technical merits, which is included in other current and non-current liabilities. Nonetheless, the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year.\nThe Tax Act that was signed into law in December 2017 constitutes a major change to the U.S. tax system. The impact of the Tax Act on the Company is based on management's current interpretations of the Tax Act, recently issued regulations and related analysis. The Company's tax liability may be materially different based on regulatory developments. In future periods, our effective tax rate could be subject to additional uncertainty as a result of regulatory developments related to the Tax Act.\nRefer to Note 7, Income Taxes,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding income taxes.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1, Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding new applicable accounting pronouncements.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe Company's primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We are also affected by changes in the prices of commodities used or consumed in our manufacturing operations. Some of our commodity purchase price risk is covered by supply agreements with customers and suppliers. Other commodity purchase price risk is addressed by hedging strategies, which include forward contracts. The Company enters into derivative instruments only with high credit quality counterparties and diversifies its positions across such counterparties in order to reduce its exposure to credit losses. We do not engage in any derivative instruments for purposes other than hedging specific operating risks.\nWe have established policies and procedures to manage sensitivity to interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and commodity purchase price risk, which include monitoring the level of exposure to each market risk. For quantitative disclosures about market risk, refer to Note 17, Financial Instruments,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for information with respect to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity purchase price risk.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates. The Company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to optimize its interest costs. The Company selectively uses interest rate swaps to reduce market value risk associated with changes in interest rates (fair value hedges). At December 31, 2020, all of the Company's long-term debt had fixed interest rates.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nForeign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that the Company will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Currently, the Company's most significant currency exposures relate to the Brazil Real, Chinese Renminbi, Euro, Hungarian Forint, Japanese Yen, Korean Won, Mexican Peso and Swedish Krona. The Company mitigates its foreign currency exchange rate risk by establishing local production facilities and related supply chain participants in the markets it serves, by invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of the products and by funding some of its investments in foreign markets through local currency loans. The Company also monitors its foreign currency exposure in each country and implements strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments. In addition, the Company periodically enters into forward currency contracts, cross-currency swaps and foreign currency denominated debt designated as net investment hedges to reduce exposure to translation exchange rate risk. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded a deferred loss of $204 million and a deferred gain of $4 million, respectively, both before taxes, for net investment hedges within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nThe foreign currency translation adjustments during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are shown in the following table, which provides the percentage change in U.S. dollar against the respective currencies and the approximate impacts of these changes recorded within other comprehensive income (loss) for the respective periods.\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except for percentages) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Chinese renminbi </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>124 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Euro </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Korean won </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brazilian real </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(14) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Swedish krona </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(8) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except for percentages) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Euro </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(18) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Chinese renminbi </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(17) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Swedish krona </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(15) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommodity Price Risk\nCommodity price risk is the possibility that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in the cost of raw materials used in the production of our products. Commodity forward and option contracts are executed to offset our exposure to potential change in prices mainly for various non-ferrous metals and natural gas consumption used in the manufacturing of vehicle components. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had no material outstanding commodity swap contracts. The related fair value of these swaps was immaterial.\nDisclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThe matters discussed in this Item 7 include forward looking statements. See Forward Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "item_7_truncated": "The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. at the federal and state level and numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions.

The increase for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to 2019 cash outflows related to the 2019 derecognition of Morse TEC, a former wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, that held asbestos and certain other liabilities, which included a contribution by the Company to Morse TEC of approximately $172 million. During 2020, there were lower net investments in working capital (excluding working capital acquired in the Delphi Technologies acquisition), partially offset by incremental retirement benefit plan contributions made in December 2020 to the the Delphi Technologies Pension Scheme in the United Kingdom, which is discussed further below.\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except for percentages) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Euro </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(18) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Chinese renminbi </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(17) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Swedish krona </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(15) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to the credit facility, the Company's universal shelf registration provides the ability to issue various debt and equity instruments subject to market conditions.\n\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>INVESTING </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures, including tooling outlays </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(441) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(481) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance proceeds received for damage to property, plant and equipment </td> <td>20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures for damage to property, plant and equipment </td> <td>(20) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payments for investments in equity securities </td> <td>(2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(53) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payments for businesses acquired, net of cash acquired </td> <td>(449) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from sale of businesses, net of cash divested </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from settlement of net investment hedges, net </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from asset disposals and other, net </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(866) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(489) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________\nIn February 2020, the Company announced a cost restructuring plan to address existing structural costs. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $148 million of restructuring expense related to this plan. These actions are expected to result in a total of $300 million of restructuring costs through 2022. The resulting annual gross savings is expected to be $90 million to $100 million and will be utilized to sustain overall operating margin profile and cost competitiveness. Nearly all of the restructuring charges are expected to be cash expenditures.\nNet earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest, net of tax of $67 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $16 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due to growth in sales in China, resulting in increased profit in joint ventures and the addition of noncontrolling interests from the Delphi Technologies acquisition.\nThe Company's primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We are also affected by changes in the prices of commodities used or consumed in our manufacturing operations. Some of our commodity purchase price risk is covered by supply agreements with customers and suppliers.

The Company enters into derivative instruments only with high credit quality counterparties and diversifies its positions across such counterparties in order to reduce its exposure to credit losses. We do not engage in any derivative instruments for purposes other than hedging specific operating risks.\n\nThere are several trends that are driving the Company's long-term growth that we expect to continue, including adoption of product offerings for electrified vehicles, increasingly stringent global emissions standards that support demand for the Company's products driving vehicle efficiency and increased global penetration of all-wheel drive.\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-comparable items: </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.86) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.26) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merger, acquisition and divestiture expense1\n</td> <td>(0.38) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.05) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intangible asset accelerated amortization2\n</td> <td>(0.14) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of inventory fair value adjustment3\n</td> <td>(0.10) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairment and loss on divestiture4\n</td> <td>(0.08) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.03) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain on insurance recovery for property damage5\n</td> <td>0.04 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unfavorable arbitration loss6\n</td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.07) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Officer stock awards modification </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.01) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on derecognition of subsidiary7\n</td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.02 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized gain on equity securities8\n</td> <td>1.36 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Delayed-draw term loan cancellation9\n</td> <td>(0.01) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension settlement loss10\n</td> <td>(0.02) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.10) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax adjustments11\n</td> <td>(0.23) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.02) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total impact of non-comparable items per share -

Approximately $776 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding DT Notes, representing 97% of the $800 million total outstanding principal amount of the DT Notes, were validly exchanged and cancelled for new BorgWarner notes. Following such cancellation, approximately $24 million in aggregate principal amount of the DT Notes remain outstanding. Since the majority of the DT Notes were exchanged, the Company was able to eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants and events of default not related to payment on the $800 million in outstanding senior notes of the Company.\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except for percentages) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Chinese renminbi </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>124 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Euro </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Korean won </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brazilian real </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(14) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Swedish krona </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(8) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company estimates the fair value of acquired customer relationships using the multi-period excess earnings method. Value is estimated as the present value of the benefits anticipated from ownership of the asset, in excess of the returns required on the investment in contributory assets which are necessary to realize those benefits. The intangible asset's estimated earnings are determined as the residual earnings after quantifying estimated earnings from contributory assets. Assumptions used in these calculations are considered from a market participant perspective and include revenue growth rates, estimated earnings, contributory asset charges, customer attrition and discount rates.\nRefer to Note 18, Retirement Benefit Plans,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits.\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except per share data) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of net sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of net sales </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Air Management </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,678 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>e-Propulsion & Drivetrain </td> <td>3,989 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fuel Injection </td> <td>479 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aftermarket </td> <td>194 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inter-segment eliminations </td> <td>(175) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(61) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net sales </td> <td>10,165 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,168 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales </td> <td>8,255 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,067 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td>1,910 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses -

Excluding the impact of weaker foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, and the net impact of the Delphi Technologies acquisition, net sales decreased approximately 11%, primarily due to COVID-19 related production slowdowns and shutdowns during the first six months of 2020, partially offset by stronger sales in China.\n\u2022a temporary 20% reduction in base salaries of our senior executive leadership team and annual retainers of our non-employee directors;\nResults of operations for Delphi Technologies are included in the Company's financial information following the date of acquisition on October 1, 2020.\n(a)Other postretirement employee benefits, excluding pensions, include anticipated future payments to cover retiree medical and life insurance benefits. Amount contained in More than 5 years\u201d column includes estimated payments through 2030. Refer to Note 18, Retirement Benefit Plans,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for disclosures related to the Company's other postretirement employee benefits.\nThe Company believes the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair value are reasonable. Different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value. The primary assumptions affecting the Company's 2020 goodwill quantitative, step one,\u201d impairment review are as follows:\nCost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 81.2% and 79.3% in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cost of sales associated with Delphi Technologies for the three months ended December 31, 2020 was approximately $900 million. Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Delphi Technologies, cost of sales decreased primarily due to lower sales. The Company's material cost of sales was approximately 57% and 55% of net sales in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 18.8% and 20.7% in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The reduction of gross margin in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company took numerous steps to eliminate costs; however, certain fixed costs could not be reduced on a temporary basis, which led to a higher cost of sales as a percentage of sales as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, the $27 million related to the fair value adjustment of inventories acquired had an unfavorable impact on gross margin and, to a lesser extent, certain lower margin business related to the acquisition of Delphi Technologies.\n\n 1 During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded merger, acquisition and divestiture expense of $96 million primarily for professional fees associated with the Company's acquisition of Delphi Technologies completed on October 1, 2020. For December 31, 2019, the Company recorded $11 million of expenses, primarily professional fees, related to the Company's strategic acquisition and divestiture activities, including the transfer of Morse TEC, the anticipated acquisition of Delphi Technologies, and a 20% equity interest in Romeo Systems, Inc. (now known as Romeo Power, Inc.) and the divestiture activities for the non-core pipes and thermostat product lines. 2 During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded accelerated amortization of $38 million for certain intangible assets. Refer to Note 12, Goodwill And Other Intangibles,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information. 3 Represents the non-cash charges related to the amortization of the fair value adjustment of inventories acquired in connection with the acquisition of Delphi Technologies during the year ended December 31, 2020. Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information. 4 During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded asset impairments of $17 million, which was related to asset impairment charges of $9 million in the Air Management segment and $8 million in the e-Propulsion & Drivetrain segment, due to the write down of property, plant and equipment associated with the announced closures of two European facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded an additional loss on sale of $7 million to account for the cash proceeds and finalization of the purchase price adjustments related to the sale of the non-core pipes and thermostat product lines. Refer to Note 6, Other Operating Expense (Income), Net,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information. 5 During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a net gain of $9 million from insurance recovery proceeds which primarily represents the amount received for replacement cost in excess of carrying value for losses sustained for a tornado that damaged the Company's plant in Seneca, South Carolina. Refer to Note 6, Other Operating Expense (Income), Net,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information. 6 During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded $14 million of expenses related to the receipt of a final unfavorable arbitration decision associated with the resolution of a matter related to a previous acquisition. 7 During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a pre-tax gain on the derecognition of BorgWarner Morse TEC LLC ( Morse TEC\u201d) of $177 million and removed the asbestos obligations and related insurance assets from the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In addition, the Company recorded tax expense as a result of the reversal of the previously recorded deferred tax assets related to the asbestos liabilities of $173 million, resulting in an after-tax gain of $4 million. Refer to Note 21, Contingencies,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information. 8 Represents the net unrealized gain of $382 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the Company's equity securities in Romeo Power, Inc. which became a public company in December 2020. Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information. 9 Represents loan fees related to term loan cancellation during the year ended December 31, 2020. On April 29, 2020 the Company entered into a $750 million delayed-draw term loan which was subsequently cancelled on June 19, 2020 in accordance with its terms, following the Company's issuance of $1.1 billion in 2.650% senior notes due July 2027. 10 During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a non-cash pension settlement loss of $4 million related to a European plant closure. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a non-cash pension settlement loss of $27 million related to the accelerated recognition of unamortized losses. Refer to Note 18, Retirement Benefit Plans,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information. 11 The Company's provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020, includes reductions to tax expense of $5 million related to tax reserves and true-up adjustments offset by an increase in tax expense of $54 million for the finalization of the U.S. Department of the Treasury regulations issued in the third quarter of 2020, that impacted the net tax on remittance of foreign earnings. \nIn this line item for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is merger, acquisition and divestiture expense of $96 million and $11 million, respectively. The increase in 2020 was primarily related to professional fees associated with the acquisition of Delphi Technologies completed on October 1, 2020.\nActual returns on U.S. pension assets were 9.3% and 18.0% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 6.0% for the same years ended.\nCommodity price risk is the possibility that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in the cost of raw materials used in the production of our products. Commodity forward and option contracts are executed to offset our exposure to potential change in prices mainly for various non-ferrous metals and natural gas consumption used in the manufacturing of vehicle components. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had no material outstanding commodity swap contracts. The related fair value of these swaps was immaterial.\nEnvironmental\nIn response to the outbreak and business disruption, we, first and foremost, prioritized the health and safety of our employees. As a global manufacturer, we have responded to shelter-in-place and similar government orders in various locations around the world, including throughout the United States and Europe. Additionally, our employees must respond to self-isolation and quarantine orders based on circumstances in their local communities, which continues to impact our facilities. The reopening procedures related to COVID-19 led to a number of employee safety measures upon reopening to contain the spread, including domestic and international travel restrictions, work-from-home practices, extensive cleaning protocols, social distancing guidelines, requirement for employees to wear masks and various temporary closures of or reduced operations at our manufacturing and assembly facilities.\nIn addition, the year ended December 31, 2019 included a pre-tax gain of $177 million related to the derecognition of BorgWarner Morse TEC LLC ( Morse TEC\u201d), which was a consolidated wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company that held asbestos and certain other liabilities and was the policyholder of the related insurance assets. Also related to this matter, the Company recorded tax expense as a result of the reversal of the previously recorded deferred tax assets related to the asbestos liabilities of $173 million, resulting in an after-tax gain of $4 million. Refer to Note 21, Contingencies,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information.\nBusiness combinations The Company allocates the cost of an acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess value of the cost of an acquired business over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. The valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results. The Company uses a variety of information sources to determine the value of acquired assets and liabilities including: third-party appraisers for the values and lives of property, identifiable intangibles and inventories; and actuaries for defined benefit retirement plans. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units as of the date of the related acquisition. If goodwill is assigned to more than one reporting unit, the Company utilizes a method that is consistent with the manner in which the amount of goodwill in a business combination is determined. Costs related to the acquisition of a business are expensed as incurred.\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in discount rate for Company sponsored U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans on its pension obligations:\nIn addition to the above primary assumptions, the Company notes the following risks to volume and operating income assumptions that could have an impact on the discounted cash flow models:\n\u2022Discount rate: the Company used a 11.7% weighted average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d) as the discount rate for future cash flows. The WACC is intended to represent a rate of return that would be expected by a market participant.\nNon-comparable items impacting the Company's earnings per diluted share and net earnings\n\u2022The Company is dependent on market segments that use our key products and would be affected by decreasing demand in those segments.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $866 million and $489 million in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to cash outflows related to the 2020 acquisition of Delphi Technologies. Capital expenditures, including tooling outlays, were $40 million lower in 2020 primarily due to lower overall spending as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by capital expenditures in the Company's fourth quarter from the acquisition of Delphi Technologies.\nSegment Adjusted EBIT is the measure of segment income or loss used by the Company. The Company believes Segment Adjusted EBIT is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our reporting segments. The following table shows Segment Adjusted EBIT for the Company's reporting segments.\nWe continue to monitor the evolving situation and guidance from international and domestic authorities, including federal, state and local public health authorities and may take additional actions based on their recommendations. In these circumstances, there may be developments outside our control requiring us to adjust our operating plan. To date, COVID-19 has had a material adverse impact on our revenue and overall profitability, primarily in the quarter ended June 30, 2020. Significant reductions in automotive or truck production have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on the Company's sales to OEMs. While production levels increased in the third and fourth quarters and revenue and profitability improved, COVID-19 continues to impact our business globally, and it is possible\nIncome taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.\nThe Company allocates resources to each segment based upon the projected after-tax return on invested capital ( ROIC\u201d) of its business initiatives. ROIC is comprised of Segment Adjusted EBIT after deducting notional taxes compared to the projected average capital investment required. Segment Adjusted EBIT is comprised of earnings before interest, income taxes and noncontrolling interest ( EBIT\u201d) adjusted for restructuring, goodwill impairment charges, affiliates' earnings and other items not reflective of ongoing operating income or loss. Segment Adjusted EBIT excludes certain corporate costs which primarily represents headquarters' expenses not directly attributable to the individual segments. Corporate expenses not allocated to Segment Adjusted EBIT were $192 million and $206 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. An increase in corporate expenses related to the acquisition of Delphi Technologies in 2020 was more than offset by savings and actions taken during the year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including decreased compensation expense, resulting in a decrease compared to 2019.\nThe Aftermarket segment's net sales and Segment Adjusted EBIT for the three months ended December 31, 2020 were $194 million and $22 million, respectively. The Segment Adjusted EBIT margin was 11.3% in the three months ended December 31, 2020. This is a new reporting segment following the acquisition of Delphi Technologies on October 1, 2020.\nThe effective tax rate was approximately 41% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Unfavorably impacting the effective tax rate in 2020 was income tax expense related to final U.S. Department of Treasury regulations issued in the third quarter of 2020, that impacted the net tax on remittance of foreign earnings and certain tax law changes in India effective in the first quarter of 2020. In addition, we recognized incremental valuation allowances of $53 million in 2020. Also unfavorably impacting the effective tax rate were certain restructuring expenses and merger and acquisition related transaction costs that were non-deductible for tax purposes. Excluding the impact of non-comparable items, the Company's annual effective tax rate associated with ongoing operations was 32% for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nSimilar to goodwill, the Company can elect to perform the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (primarily trade names) using a qualitative analysis, considering similar factors as outlined in the goodwill discussion in order to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the trade names is less than the respective carrying values. If the Company elects to perform or is required to perform a quantitative analysis, the test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date. The Company estimates the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief-from-royalty method, which it believes is an appropriate and widely used valuation technique for such assets. The fair value derived from the relief-from-royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trade names and not being required to pay a royalty for their use.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties ( PRPs\u201d) at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ( Superfund\u201d) and equivalent state laws and, as such, may presently be liable for the cost of clean-up and other remedial activities at 26 such sites. Responsibility for clean-up and other remedial activities at a Superfund site is typically shared among PRPs based on an allocation formula.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nBorgWarner Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries (the Company\u201d) is a global product leader in clean and efficient technology solutions for combustion, hybrid and electric vehicles. Our products help improve vehicle performance, propulsion efficiency, stability and air quality. These products are manufactured and sold worldwide, primarily to original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs\u201d) of light vehicles (passenger cars, sport-utility vehicles ( SUVs\u201d), vans and light trucks). The Company's products are also sold to other OEMs of commercial vehicles (medium-duty trucks, heavy-duty trucks and buses) and off-highway vehicles (agricultural and construction machinery and marine applications). We also manufacture and sell our products to certain Tier One vehicle systems suppliers and into the aftermarket for light, commercial and off-highway vehicles. The Company operates manufacturing facilities serving customers in Europe, the Americas and Asia and is an original equipment supplier to nearly every major automotive OEM in the world.\nPension and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits\nmake contributions as benefit payments become due. Additionally, $186 million of the net unfunded position at December 31, 2020 relates to the acquired Delphi Technologies Pension Scheme in the United Kingdom, which includes the $137 million contribution as discussed above.\n\nDisclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThe sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the Company's total 2021 U.S. OPEB expense is expected to be negligible, as any increase in interest expense will be offset by net actuarial gains.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company performed an analysis on each reporting unit. Following the acquisition of Delphi Technologies and the resulting reorganization of the business, the Company elected to perform quantitative, step one,\u201d goodwill impairment analyses for certain reporting units to refresh their respective fair values. This requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates. The basis of this goodwill impairment analysis is the Company's annual budget and long-range plan ( LRP\u201d). The annual budget and LRP includes a five-year projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments. Because the projections are estimated over a significant future period of time, those estimates and assumptions are subject to uncertainty. Further, the market valuation\nOn March 13, 2020, the Company amended its multi-currency revolving credit facility, by increasing the size of the facility from $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion and by extending the maturity until March 13, 2025.\n\nCommodity Price Risk\nCash Flows\nRestructuring expense was $203 million and $72 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, primarily related to employee benefit costs. The increase in 2020 was primarily due to increased costs related to the announced closure of two facilities in Europe affecting approximately 550 employees and contractually required severance and stock-based compensation associated with the Delphi Technologies acquisition.\nThe vast majority of cash and cash equivalents held outside the United States is available for repatriation. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred. As of January 1, 2018, funds repatriated from foreign subsidiaries are generally no longer taxable for U.S. federal tax purposes. In light of the treatment of foreign earnings under the Tax Act, the Company recorded a liability for the U.S. federal and applicable state income tax liabilities calculated under the provisions of the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. A deferred tax liability has been recorded for substantially all estimated legally distributable foreign earnings. The Company uses its U.S. liquidity primarily for various corporate purposes, including but not limited to debt service, share repurchases, dividend distributions, acquisitions and divestitures and other corporate expenses.\n\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Update\nThe Company believes it will be able to fund the requirements of these plans through cash generated from operations or other available sources of financing for the foreseeable future.\nOn February 12, 2020, April 29, 2020, July 29, 2020 and November 11, 2020, the Company's Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.17 per share of common stock. These dividends were paid on March 16, 2020, June 15, 2020, September 15, 2020 and December 15, 2020, respectively.\nEffective September 1, 2020, all of the base pay and annual retainer reductions had been eliminated.\nThe Company's defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 715. The determination of the Company's obligation and expense for its pension and other postretirement employee benefits, such as retiree health care, is dependent on certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. Certain assumptions, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rate, rates of increase in compensation and health care costs trends are described in Note 18, Retirement Benefit Plans,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. The effects of any modification to those assumptions are either recognized immediately or amortized over future periods in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Air Management segment's net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $536 million, or 8.6%, and Segment Adjusted EBIT decreased $233 million, or 23.4%, from the year ended December 31, 2019. The Delphi Technologies acquisition increased Air Management revenues by $312 million in 2020. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and of strengthening foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, net sales decreased 13.5% from the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in sales was due to COVID-19 related production slowdowns and shutdowns during the first six months of 2020, partially offset by growing demand for the Company's products. The Segment Adjusted EBIT margin was 13.4% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 16.0% in the year ended December 31, 2019. The Segment Adjusted EBIT margin decrease was primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of increased warranty costs.\n\nhas made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management makes estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, relating to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our most critical accounting policies are discussed below.\nInterest Rate Risk\nRestructuring Restructuring costs may occur when the Company takes action to exit or significantly curtail a part of its operations or implements a reorganization that affects the nature and focus of operations. A restructuring charge can consist of severance costs associated with reductions to the workforce, costs to terminate an operating lease or contract, professional fees and other costs incurred related to the implementation of restructuring activities.\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFuture changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our acquisition valuations and intangible asset and goodwill impairment testing, including discount rates or future operating results and related cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values in the future. An increase in discount rates, a reduction in projected cash flows or a combination of the two could lead to a reduction in the estimated fair values, which may result in impairment charges that could materially affect our financial statements in any given year.\nSegment Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes and Noncontrolling Interest ( Segment Adjusted EBIT\u201d)\nIn April 2020, we implemented a range of actions aimed at temporarily reducing costs and preserving liquidity. These actions included, but were not limited to:\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of a 25 basis-point change (as a percentage of net sales) in the assumed warranty trend on the Company's accrued warranty liability:\nThe Company believes that none of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Generally, this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not material or the liability will be shared with other PRPs, although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter.\n\n\nIn accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from assumptions used are accumulated and generally amortized over future periods. The primary assumptions affecting the Company's accounting for employee benefits under ASC Topics 712 and 715 as of December 31, 2020 are as follows:\n\nThe Company's commercial paper program allows the Company to issue $2.0 billion of short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes under the limits of its multi-currency revolving credit facility. The commercial paper program automatically increased to $2.0 billion upon the closing of the acquisition of Delphi Technologies on October 1, 2020. Under this program, the Company may issue notes from time to time and use the proceeds for general corporate purposes. The Company had no outstanding borrowings under this program as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n________________\nTo date, COVID-19 has surfaced in nearly all regions around the world and has resulted, at times, in travel restrictions, closing of borders and business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas. Many OEMs temporarily suspended certain manufacturing operations, particularly in North America and Europe, due to market conditions and matters associated with COVID-19. Furthermore, COVID-19 has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The continued spread of COVID-19 has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which adversely impact the access to capital and increase the cost of capital.\nThe funded status of all pension plans was a net unfunded position of $501 million and $212 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Of these amounts, $139 million and $107 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were related to plans in Germany, where there is no tax deduction allowed under the applicable regulations to fund the plans; hence, the common practice is to\nThe Company maintains various liquidity sources including cash and cash equivalents and the unused portion of our multi-currency revolving credit agreement. At December 31, 2020, the Company had $1,650 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which $1,088 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our subsidiaries outside of the United States. Cash and cash equivalents held by these subsidiaries is used to fund foreign operational activities and future investments, including acquisitions.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nOutlook\nEquity in affiliates' earnings, net of tax was $18 million and $32 million in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. This line item is driven by the results of our unconsolidated joint ventures, NSK-Warner K.K., Turbo Energy Private Limited ( TEL\u201d) and Delphi-TVS Diesel Systems Ltd. The decrease in equity in affiliates' earnings in the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to lower industry volumes and cost pressures in a reduced market.\nRefer to Note 7, Income Taxes,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding income taxes.\nmodels and other financial ratios used by the Company require certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to the Company's facts and circumstances.\nThe multi-currency revolving credit agreement automatically increased to $2.0 billion upon the closing of the acquisition of Delphi Technologies on October 1, 2020. Additionally, the agreement allows the Company the ability to increase the facility by $1.0 billion with bank group approval. The credit agreement contains customary events of default and one key financial covenant, which is a debt-to-EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. The Company was in compliance with the financial covenant at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under this facility.\nAccounting for income taxes is complex, in part because the Company conducts business globally and therefore files income tax returns in numerous tax jurisdictions. Management judgment is required in determining the Company's worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities, including accruals for unrecognized tax benefits. In calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis, the Company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial performance of the operation recording the net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information. Since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to the Company's valuation allowance may be necessary.\nPension and other postretirement defined benefits The Company provides postretirement defined benefits to a number of its current and former employees. Costs associated with postretirement defined benefits include pension and postretirement health care expenses for employees, retirees and surviving spouses and dependents.\nBased on the assumptions outlined above, the impairment testing conducted in the fourth quarter of 2020 indicated the Company's goodwill assigned to the respective reporting units was not impaired. Future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates from those used in acquisition-related valuations and goodwill impairment testing, including discount rates or future operating results and related cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values in the future. An increase in discount rates, a reduction in projected cash flows or a combination of the two could lead to a reduction in the estimated fair values, which may result in impairment charges that could materially affect our financial statements in any given year.\nProvision for income taxes the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 41.2% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with the rate of 37.1% for the year ended December 31, 2019. For further details, see Note 7, Income Taxes,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is party to various commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints, including matters involving warranty claims, intellectual property claims, general liability and various other risks. It is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the Company will ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal matters or, if not, what the impact might be. The Company's environmental and product liability contingencies are discussed separately below. The Company's management does not expect that an adverse outcome in any of these commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows, although it could be material to the results of operations in a particular quarter.\nThis line item is primarily comprised of operating expense (income) items discussed within the subtitle Non-comparable items impacting the Company's earnings per diluted share and net earnings\u201d below.\nActual returns on German pension assets were 4.3% and 21.0% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 6.0% for the same years ended.\nActual returns on U.K. pension assets were 4.0% and 9.5% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 4.0% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 5% for the year ended in 2019.\nResults By Reporting Segment\nThe effective tax rate was approximately 37% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The effective tax rate for 2019 included an increase in income tax expense of $173 million related to the derecognition of the Morse TEC asbestos-related deferred tax assets and $22 million due to the U.S. Department of the Treasury's issuance of the final regulations in the first quarter of 2019 related to the calculation of the one-time transition tax. The 2019 effective tax rate also included reductions of income tax expense of $19 million related to restructuring expense, $11 million for a global realignment plan, $8 million related to other one-time adjustments and $6 million related to pension settlement loss. Excluding the impact of non-comparable items, the Company's annual effective tax rate was 26% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nWhile the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions, fair value estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Any adjustments required after the measurement period are recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings.\nAs a result of an evaluation of the underlying technologies and management of the business subsequent to the acquisition of Delphi Technologies, the Company reduced the useful life of certain intangible assets during the fourth quarter of 2020 as they no longer provided future economic benefit. This resulted in accelerated amortization expense of $38 million recorded within this line item.\nThe Company's business is comprised of four reporting segments: Air Management, e-Propulsion & Drivetrain, Fuel Injection and Aftermarket.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe Company recorded approximately $54 million in restructuring during the three months ended December 31, 2020, related to legacy Delphi Technologies. In conjunction with the acquisition, there were contractually required severance and post-combination stock-based compensation cash payments to legacy Delphi Technologies executive officers and other employee termination benefits. Additionally, in 2019, legacy Delphi Technologies announced a restructuring plan to reshape and realign its global technical center footprint and reduce salaried and contract staff, with expected charges of up to $175 million. Certain of these actions are subject to consultation with employee works councils and other employee representatives. The majority of these actions are expected to be completed by the end of 2021. Nearly all of the restructuring charges are expected to be cash expenditures.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n360. In assessing long-lived assets for an impairment loss, assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. In assessing long-lived assets for impairment, management generally considers individual facilities the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent. A recoverability review is performed using the undiscounted cash flows if there is a triggering event. If the undiscounted cash flow test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment, management will perform a fair value analysis. Management determines fair value under ASC Topic 820 using the appropriate valuation technique of market, income or cost approach. If the carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.\nFrom a credit quality perspective, the Company had a credit rating of BBB+ from both Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings and Baa1 from Moody's as of December 31, 2019, with a stable outlook from all rating agencies. On January 28, 2020, the Company entered into the agreement to acquire Delphi Technologies. During 2020, due to the recent business disruptions from COVID-19 and uncertainties surrounding the Delphi Technologies acquisition, Standard & Poor's downgraded the Company's rating from BBB+ with a stable outlook to BBB with a negative outlook. Additionally, Moody's and Fitch adjusted their outlooks from stable to negative but have maintained the Company's credit ratings at Baa1 and BBB+, respectively. None of the Company's debt agreements require accelerated repayment in the event of a downgrade in credit ratings.\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). In preparing these financial statements, management\nThe Company generally records costs associated with voluntary separations at the time of employee acceptance. Costs for involuntary separation programs are recorded when management has approved the plan for separation, the employees are identified and aware of the benefits they are entitled to and it is unlikely that the plan will change significantly. When a plan of separation requires approval by or consultation with the relevant labor organization or government, the costs are recorded upon agreement. Costs associated with benefits that are contingent on the employee continuing to provide service are accrued over the required service period.\nFollowing the Delphi Technologies acquisition, to align with the manner in which the business is viewed and managed subsequent to the acquisition, the Company reorganized its management reporting structure. Previously, the Company reported its results under two reporting segments, Engine and Drivetrain, which are now referred to as Air Management and e-Propulsion & Drivetrain, respectively. The former Delphi Technologies Powertrain Products segment was integrated into the Air Management segment and the former Delphi Technologies Electronics & Electrification segment was integrated into the e-Propulsion & Drivetrain segment. The remaining Delphi Technologies segments comprise two additional reporting segments, which are referred to as Fuel Injection and Aftermarket.\n\u2022Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets: The expected long-term rate of return is used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost. The required use of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year. Over time, however, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is designed to approximate actual earned long-term returns. The expected long-term rate of return for pension assets has been determined based on various inputs, including historical returns for the different asset classes held by the Company's trusts and its asset allocation, as well as inputs from internal and external sources regarding expected capital market return, inflation and other variables. The Company also considers the impact of active management of the plans' invested assets. In determining its pension expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company used long-term rates of return on plan assets ranging from 1.5% to 7.7% outside of the U.S. and 6.0% in the U.S.\n(b)Since the timing and amount of payments for funded defined benefit pension plans are usually not certain for future years such potential payments are not shown in this table. Amount contained in More than 5 years\u201d column is for unfunded plans and includes estimated payments through 2030. Refer to Note 18, Retirement Benefit Plans,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for disclosures related to the Company's pension benefits.\nRefer to Note 21, Contingencies,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for further details and information respecting the Company's environmental liability.\nThe Company expects to contribute a total of $20 million to $30 million into its defined benefit pension plans during 2021. Of the $20 million to $30 million in projected 2021 contributions, $6 million are contractually obligated, while any remaining payments would be discretionary.\nRefer to Note 1, Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding new applicable accounting pronouncements.\nThe Company's policy is to fund its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with applicable government regulations and to make additional contributions when appropriate. At December 31, 2020, all legal funding requirements had been met. The Company contributed $174 million, $26 million and $26 million to its defined benefit pension plans in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. On October 1, 2020, as a result of the acquisition of Delphi Technologies, the Company assumed all of the retirement-related liabilities of Delphi Technologies, the most significant of which is the Delphi Technologies Pension Scheme (the Scheme\u201d) in the United Kingdom. On December 12, 2020, the Company entered into a Heads of Terms Agreement (the Agreement\u201d) with the Trustees of the Scheme related to the future funding of the Scheme. Under the Agreement, the Company eliminated the prior schedule of contributions between Delphi Technologies and the Scheme in exchange for a $137 million (\u00a3100 million) one-time contribution into the Scheme Plan by December 31, 2020, which was paid on December 15, 2020. The Agreement also contained other provisions regarding the implementation of a revised asset investment strategy as well as a funding progress test that will be performed every three years to determine if additional contributions need to be made into the Scheme by the Company. At this time, the Company anticipates that no additional contributions will be made into the Scheme until 2026 at the earliest.\n\u2022The Company is subject to risks related to international operations.\nRefer to Note 12, Goodwill And Other Intangibles,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding goodwill.\nThe Tax Act that was signed into law in December 2017 constitutes a major change to the U.S. tax system. The impact of the Tax Act on the Company is based on management's current interpretations of the Tax Act, recently issued regulations and related analysis. The Company's tax liability may be materially different based on regulatory developments. In future periods, our effective tax rate could be subject to additional uncertainty as a result of regulatory developments related to the Tax Act.\nInterest expense was $73 million and $55 million in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to the Company's issuance of $1.1 billion senior notes in June 2020 and the $800 million DT Notes acquired as part of the Delphi Technologies acquisition.\nWe believe that the combination of cash from operations, cash balances, available credit facilities, and the universal shelf registration capacity will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for our current level of operations and our planned operations for the foreseeable future. We will continue to balance our needs for internal growth, external growth, debt reduction and cash conservation.\nThe following table presents a summary of our operating results:\nThe Company estimates the fair value of trade names and developed technology using the relief from royalty method, which calculates the cost savings associated with owning rather than licensing the assets. Assumed royalty rates are applied to projected revenue for the remaining useful lives of the assets to estimate the royalty savings. Assumptions in the determination of the fair value of the developed technology included revenue growth rates, royalty rates, obsolescence factors and discount rates. Assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of the trade name included the revenue growth rates, the royalty rate and discount rate.\nOther postretirement employee benefits primarily consist of postretirement health care benefits for certain employees and retirees of the Company's U.S. operations. The Company funds these benefits as retiree claims are incurred. Other postretirement employee benefits had an unfunded status of $65 million and $81 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nFinancing Activities\nSelling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A\u201d) was $951 million and $873 million, or 9.4% and 8.6% of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. SG&A increased as a result of the three months of activity related to Delphi Technologies following the acquisition on October 1, 2020. The increase related to Delphi Technologies was partially offset by savings and actions taken during the year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn October 1, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of 100% of the outstanding ordinary shares of Delphi Technologies PLC ( Delphi Technologies\u201d) from the shareholders of Delphi Technologies pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Agreement, dated January 28, 2020, as amended on May 6, 2020, by and between the Company and Delphi Technologies (the Transaction Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Agreement, the Company issued, in exchange for each Delphi Technologies share, 0.4307 of a share of common stock of the Company and cash in lieu of any fractional share. In the aggregate, the Company delivered consideration of approximately $2.4 billion, including approximately 37 million shares of common stock of the Company, valued at $1.5 billion, repayment of approximately $900 million of Delphi Technologies' debt and stock-based compensation of approximately $15 million. Upon closing, the Company also assumed approximately $800 million in senior notes as discussed below. The acquisition is expected to strengthen the Company's electronics and power electronics products, capabilities and scale, position the Company for greater growth as electrified propulsion systems gain momentum and enhance key combustion, commercial vehicle and aftermarket product offerings.\nAcquisition of Delphi Technologies PLC\nContractual Obligations\nOperating Activities\nIn April 2019, the Company announced a cost restructuring plan including several actions to reduce existing structural costs. These actions were primarily completed during fourth quarter 2019 and resulted\nThe matters discussed in this Item 7 include forward looking statements. See Forward Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n\u2022The automotive industry is cyclical, and the Company's results of operations would be adversely affected by industry downturns.\n\nForeign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that the Company will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Currently, the Company's most significant currency exposures relate to the Brazil Real, Chinese Renminbi, Euro, Hungarian Forint, Japanese Yen, Korean Won, Mexican Peso and Swedish Krona. The Company mitigates its foreign currency exchange rate risk by establishing local production facilities and related supply chain participants in the markets it serves, by invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of the products and by funding some of its investments in foreign markets through local currency loans. The Company also monitors its foreign currency exposure in each country and implements strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments. In addition, the Company periodically enters into forward currency contracts, cross-currency swaps and foreign currency denominated debt designated as net investment hedges to reduce exposure to translation exchange rate risk. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded a deferred loss of $204 million and a deferred gain of $4 million, respectively, both before taxes, for net investment hedges within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity to a 25 basis-point change in the assumed health care cost trend related to the Company's OPEB obligation and service and interest cost:\n\u2022Operating income margin: the Company used historical and expected operating income margins, which may vary based on the projections of the reporting unit being evaluated.\nInvesting Activities\nThe Fuel Injection segment's net sales and Segment Adjusted EBIT for the three months December 31, 2020 were $479 million and $39 million, respectively. The Segment Adjusted EBIT margin was 8.1% in the three months ended December 31, 2020. This is a new reporting segment following the acquisition of Delphi Technologies on October 1, 2020.\n\u2022Health care cost trend: For postretirement employee health care plan accounting, the Company reviews external data and Company-specific historical trends for health care cost to determine the health care cost trend rate assumptions. In determining the projected benefit obligation for postretirement employee health care plans as of December 31, 2020, the Company used health care cost trend rates of 6.50%, declining to an ultimate trend rate of 4.75% by the year 2025.\nA detailed comparison of the Company's 2018 operating results to its 2019 operating results can be found in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section in the Company's 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed February 13, 2020.\nCOVID-19 could result in adverse impacts in the future. We cannot reasonably estimate the full impacts COVID-19 could have on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future.\nWhile the Company believes that these assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the Company's pension and OPEB and its future expense.\nin approximately $50 million of restructuring expense. The resulting annual gross cost reduction is expected to be in the range of $40 million to $50 million by 2021.\nGoodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets During the fourth quarter of each year, the Company qualitatively assesses its goodwill assigned to each of its reporting units. This qualitative assessment evaluates various events and circumstances, such as macro-economic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, relevant events and financial trends, that may impact a reporting unit's fair value. Using this qualitative assessment, the Company determines whether it is more-likely-than-not the reporting unit's fair value exceeds its carrying value. If it is determined that it is not more-likely-than-not the reporting unit's fair value exceeds the carrying value, or upon consideration of other factors, including recent acquisition, restructuring or divestiture activity or to refresh the fair values, the Company performs a quantitative, step one,\u201d goodwill impairment analysis. In addition, the Company may test goodwill in between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.\nContingencies\nRefer to Note 13, Product Warranty,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding product warranties.\n\u2022reductions in discretionary spending, such as outside professional services and travel.\n\u2022up to 10% temporary base pay reductions for other salaried employees; and\nImpairment of long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets The Company reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets, whether held for use or disposal, including other amortizing intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review under ASC Topic\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $437 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 and net cash used in financing activities was $420 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily driven by the Company's issuance of $1.1 billion in 2.650% senior notes, partially offset by the repayment of the $250 million in 4.625% senior notes and higher share repurchases.\nOur overall outlook for 2021 is positive. The Company expects global industry production to increase year over year due to the negative effects of COVID-19 on 2020 production not recurring in 2021. The Company expects net new business-related sales growth, due to increased penetration of BorgWarner products around the world, to drive a sales increase in line with or greater than the year-over-year increase in industry production. As result, the Company expects increasing revenue in 2021, excluding the impact of foreign currencies and the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. The Company maintains a positive long-term outlook for its global business and is committed to new product development and strategic capital investments to enhance its product leadership strategy.\nThe foreign currency translation adjustments during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are shown in the following table, which provides the percentage change in U.S. dollar against the respective currencies and the approximate impacts of these changes recorded within other comprehensive income (loss) for the respective periods.\nProduct warranties The Company provides warranties on some, but not all, of its products. The warranty terms are typically from one to three years. Provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold. These estimates are established using historical information about the nature, frequency and average cost of warranty claim settlements as well as product manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from third parties. Management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims. Management believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate; however, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to the accrual:\nUnrealized gain on equity securities was $382 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This line item reflects the net unrealized gain recognized during 2020 related to the Company's equity securities in Romeo Systems, Inc. (now known as Romeo Power, Inc.) which became a public company in December 2020. For further details, see Note 2, Acquisitions,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.", "item_7_text": "The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. at the federal and state level and numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions. The determination of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits includes the application of complex tax laws in a multitude of jurisdictions across the Company's global operations. Management judgment is required in determining the accruals for unrecognized tax benefits. In the ordinary course of the Company's business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is less than certain. Accruals for unrecognized tax benefits are established when, despite the belief that tax positions are supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold, which is a tax position that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. The Company has certain U.S. state income tax returns and certain non-U.S. income tax returns which are currently under various stages of audit by applicable tax authorities. At December 31, 2019, the Company has a liability for tax positions the Company estimates are not more-likely-than-not to be sustained based on the technical merits, which is included in other current and non-current liabilities. Nonetheless, the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1,184 million and $1,008 million in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to 2019 cash outflows related to the 2019 derecognition of Morse TEC, a former wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, that held asbestos and certain other liabilities, which included a contribution by the Company to Morse TEC of approximately $172 million. During 2020, there were lower net investments in working capital (excluding working capital acquired in the Delphi Technologies acquisition), partially offset by incremental retirement benefit plan contributions made in December 2020 to the the Delphi Technologies Pension Scheme in the United Kingdom, which is discussed further below.\nIn addition to the credit facility, the Company's universal shelf registration provides the ability to issue various debt and equity instruments subject to market conditions.\n\n________________\nIn February 2020, the Company announced a cost restructuring plan to address existing structural costs. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $148 million of restructuring expense related to this plan. These actions are expected to result in a total of $300 million of restructuring costs through 2022. The resulting annual gross savings is expected to be $90 million to $100 million and will be utilized to sustain overall operating margin profile and cost competitiveness. Nearly all of the restructuring charges are expected to be cash expenditures.\nNet earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest, net of tax of $67 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $16 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due to growth in sales in China, resulting in increased profit in joint ventures and the addition of noncontrolling interests from the Delphi Technologies acquisition.\nThe Company's primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We are also affected by changes in the prices of commodities used or consumed in our manufacturing operations. Some of our commodity purchase price risk is covered by supply agreements with customers and suppliers. Other commodity purchase price risk is addressed by hedging strategies, which include forward contracts. The Company enters into derivative instruments only with high credit quality counterparties and diversifies its positions across such counterparties in order to reduce its exposure to credit losses. We do not engage in any derivative instruments for purposes other than hedging specific operating risks.\n\nThere are several trends that are driving the Company's long-term growth that we expect to continue, including adoption of product offerings for electrified vehicles, increasingly stringent global emissions standards that support demand for the Company's products driving vehicle efficiency and increased global penetration of all-wheel drive.\nOther operating expense (income), net - other represents items other than restructuring expense and was expense of $138 million and income of $147 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe Company's significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2020 are as follows:\nRefer to Note 18, Retirement Benefit Plans,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding the Company's retirement benefit plans.\nWe have established policies and procedures to manage sensitivity to interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and commodity purchase price risk, which include monitoring the level of exposure to each market risk. For quantitative disclosures about market risk, refer to Note 17, Financial Instruments,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for information with respect to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity purchase price risk.\nOn October 5, 2020, the Company completed its offer to exchange approximately $800 million in aggregate principal amount of Delphi Technologies' outstanding 5.000% Senior Notes due 2025 (the DT Notes\u201d). Approximately $776 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding DT Notes, representing 97% of the $800 million total outstanding principal amount of the DT Notes, were validly exchanged and cancelled for new BorgWarner notes. Following such cancellation, approximately $24 million in aggregate principal amount of the DT Notes remain outstanding. Since the majority of the DT Notes were exchanged, the Company was able to eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants and events of default not related to payment on the $800 million in outstanding senior notes of the Company.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of acquired customer relationships using the multi-period excess earnings method. Value is estimated as the present value of the benefits anticipated from ownership of the asset, in excess of the returns required on the investment in contributory assets which are necessary to realize those benefits. The intangible asset's estimated earnings are determined as the residual earnings after quantifying estimated earnings from contributory assets. Assumptions used in these calculations are considered from a market participant perspective and include revenue growth rates, estimated earnings, contributory asset charges, customer attrition and discount rates.\nRefer to Note 18, Retirement Benefit Plans,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits.\nThe total current combined borrowing capacity under the multi-currency revolving credit facility and commercial paper program cannot exceed $2.0 billion.\nResearch and development ( R&D\u201d) costs, net of customer reimbursements, were $476 million, or 4.7% of net sales, in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $413 million, or 4.1% of net sales, in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of R&D costs, net of customer reimbursements, in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to the acquisition of Delphi Technologies, which increased R&D costs by $66 million during the three months ended December 31, 2020. We will continue to invest in a number of cross-business R&D programs, as well as a number of other key programs, all of which are necessary for short- and long-term growth. Our current long-term expectation for R&D spending is in the range of 5.0% to 5.5% of net sales.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had liquidity of $3,650 million, comprised of cash and cash equivalent balances of $1,650 million and an undrawn revolving credit facility of $2,000 million. We were in full compliance with our covenants under the revolving credit facility and had full access to our undrawn revolving credit facility. Debt maturities through the end of 2021 total $45 million. Given our strong liquidity position, we believe that the Company will have sufficient liquidity and will maintain compliance with all covenants throughout the next 12 months.\nThe e-Propulsion & Drivetrain segment's net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $26 million, or 0.6%, and Segment Adjusted EBIT decreased $84 million, or 19.0%, from the year ended December 31, 2019. The Delphi Technologies acquisition increased e-Propulsion & Drivetrain revenues by $255 million in 2020. Excluding the net impact of the acquisition and of strengthening foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, net sales decreased 7.2% from the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in sales was due to COVID-19 related production slowdowns and shutdowns during the first six months of 2020, which was partially offset by growing demand for the Company's products and stronger\n\u2022Revenue growth rate: the Company used a global automotive market industry growth rate forecast adjusted to estimate its own market participation for product lines.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe Company's earnings per diluted share were $2.34 and $3.61 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The non-comparable items presented below are calculated after tax using the corresponding effective tax rate and the weighted average number of diluted shares for each of the years then ended. The Company believes the following table is useful in highlighting non-comparable items that impacted its earnings per diluted share:\nsales in China. The Segment Adjusted EBIT margin was 9.0% in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 11.0% in the year ended December 31, 2019. The Segment Adjusted EBIT margin decrease was primarily due to the impact of lower net sales, higher research and development spending and to a lesser extent the impact of the Delphi Technologies acquisition, during the three months ended December 31, 2020.\nAt December 31, 2020, the total accrued warranty liability was $253 million. The accrual is represented as $164 million in current liabilities and $89 million in non-current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\u2022Discount rate: The discount rate is used to calculate pension and other postretirement employee benefit ( OPEB\u201d) obligations. In determining the discount rate, the Company utilizes a full-yield approach in the estimation of service and interest components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. The Company used discount rates ranging from 0.48% to 12.50% to determine its pension and other benefit obligations as of December 31, 2020, including weighted average discount rates of 2.31% in the U.S., 1.44% outside of the U.S. (including 1.39% in the U.K.) and 1.93% for U.S. other postretirement health care plans. The U.S. and U.K. discount rates reflect the fact that the U.S. and U.K. pension plans have been closed for new participants.\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for Company sponsored U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans on its 2021 pre-tax pension expense:\nInterest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates. The Company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to optimize its interest costs. The Company selectively uses interest rate swaps to reduce market value risk associated with changes in interest rates (fair value hedges). At December 31, 2020, all of the Company's long-term debt had fixed interest rates.\nOTHER MATTERS\nManagement believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable; however, changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect the valuations. Significant judgments and estimates used by management when evaluating long-lived assets for impairment include: (i) an assessment as to whether an adverse event or circumstance has triggered the need for an impairment review; (ii) undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset; and (iii) fair valuation of the asset. Events and conditions that could result in impairment in the value of our long-lived assets include changes in the industries in which we operate, particularly the impact of a downturn in the global economy, as well as competition and advances in technology, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, or other factors leading to reduction in expected long-term sales or profitability.\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $10,165 million, approximately the same as net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the three months ended December 31, 2020, the Delphi Technologies acquisition increased revenues by $1,120 million. Excluding this revenue, total net sales declined by 11% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Excluding the impact of weaker foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, and the net impact of the Delphi Technologies acquisition, net sales decreased approximately 11%, primarily due to COVID-19 related production slowdowns and shutdowns during the first six months of 2020, partially offset by stronger sales in China.\n\u2022a temporary 20% reduction in base salaries of our senior executive leadership team and annual retainers of our non-employee directors;\nResults of operations for Delphi Technologies are included in the Company's financial information following the date of acquisition on October 1, 2020.\n(a)Other postretirement employee benefits, excluding pensions, include anticipated future payments to cover retiree medical and life insurance benefits. Amount contained in More than 5 years\u201d column includes estimated payments through 2030. Refer to Note 18, Retirement Benefit Plans,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for disclosures related to the Company's other postretirement employee benefits.\nThe Company believes the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair value are reasonable. Different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value. The primary assumptions affecting the Company's 2020 goodwill quantitative, step one,\u201d impairment review are as follows:\nCost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 81.2% and 79.3% in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cost of sales associated with Delphi Technologies for the three months ended December 31, 2020 was approximately $900 million. Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Delphi Technologies, cost of sales decreased primarily due to lower sales. The Company's material cost of sales was approximately 57% and 55% of net sales in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 18.8% and 20.7% in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The reduction of gross margin in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company took numerous steps to eliminate costs; however, certain fixed costs could not be reduced on a temporary basis, which led to a higher cost of sales as a percentage of sales as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, the $27 million related to the fair value adjustment of inventories acquired had an unfavorable impact on gross margin and, to a lesser extent, certain lower margin business related to the acquisition of Delphi Technologies.\n\n 1 During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded merger, acquisition and divestiture expense of $96 million primarily for professional fees associated with the Company's acquisition of Delphi Technologies completed on October 1, 2020. For December 31, 2019, the Company recorded $11 million of expenses, primarily professional fees, related to the Company's strategic acquisition and divestiture activities, including the transfer of Morse TEC, the anticipated acquisition of Delphi Technologies, and a 20% equity interest in Romeo Systems, Inc. (now known as Romeo Power, Inc.) and the divestiture activities for the non-core pipes and thermostat product lines. 2 During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded accelerated amortization of $38 million for certain intangible assets. Refer to Note 12, Goodwill And Other Intangibles,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information. 3 Represents the non-cash charges related to the amortization of the fair value adjustment of inventories acquired in connection with the acquisition of Delphi Technologies during the year ended December 31, 2020. Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information. 4 During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded asset impairments of $17 million, which was related to asset impairment charges of $9 million in the Air Management segment and $8 million in the e-Propulsion & Drivetrain segment, due to the write down of property, plant and equipment associated with the announced closures of two European facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded an additional loss on sale of $7 million to account for the cash proceeds and finalization of the purchase price adjustments related to the sale of the non-core pipes and thermostat product lines. Refer to Note 6, Other Operating Expense (Income), Net,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information. 5 During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a net gain of $9 million from insurance recovery proceeds which primarily represents the amount received for replacement cost in excess of carrying value for losses sustained for a tornado that damaged the Company's plant in Seneca, South Carolina. Refer to Note 6, Other Operating Expense (Income), Net,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information. 6 During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded $14 million of expenses related to the receipt of a final unfavorable arbitration decision associated with the resolution of a matter related to a previous acquisition. 7 During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a pre-tax gain on the derecognition of BorgWarner Morse TEC LLC ( Morse TEC\u201d) of $177 million and removed the asbestos obligations and related insurance assets from the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In addition, the Company recorded tax expense as a result of the reversal of the previously recorded deferred tax assets related to the asbestos liabilities of $173 million, resulting in an after-tax gain of $4 million. Refer to Note 21, Contingencies,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information. 8 Represents the net unrealized gain of $382 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the Company's equity securities in Romeo Power, Inc. which became a public company in December 2020. Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information. 9 Represents loan fees related to term loan cancellation during the year ended December 31, 2020. On April 29, 2020 the Company entered into a $750 million delayed-draw term loan which was subsequently cancelled on June 19, 2020 in accordance with its terms, following the Company's issuance of $1.1 billion in 2.650% senior notes due July 2027. 10 During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a non-cash pension settlement loss of $4 million related to a European plant closure. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a non-cash pension settlement loss of $27 million related to the accelerated recognition of unamortized losses. Refer to Note 18, Retirement Benefit Plans,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information. 11 The Company's provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020, includes reductions to tax expense of $5 million related to tax reserves and true-up adjustments offset by an increase in tax expense of $54 million for the finalization of the U.S. Department of the Treasury regulations issued in the third quarter of 2020, that impacted the net tax on remittance of foreign earnings. \nIn this line item for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is merger, acquisition and divestiture expense of $96 million and $11 million, respectively. The increase in 2020 was primarily related to professional fees associated with the acquisition of Delphi Technologies completed on October 1, 2020.\nActual returns on U.S. pension assets were 9.3% and 18.0% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 6.0% for the same years ended.\nCommodity price risk is the possibility that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in the cost of raw materials used in the production of our products. Commodity forward and option contracts are executed to offset our exposure to potential change in prices mainly for various non-ferrous metals and natural gas consumption used in the manufacturing of vehicle components. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had no material outstanding commodity swap contracts. The related fair value of these swaps was immaterial.\nEnvironmental\nIn response to the outbreak and business disruption, we, first and foremost, prioritized the health and safety of our employees. As a global manufacturer, we have responded to shelter-in-place and similar government orders in various locations around the world, including throughout the United States and Europe. Additionally, our employees must respond to self-isolation and quarantine orders based on circumstances in their local communities, which continues to impact our facilities. The reopening procedures related to COVID-19 led to a number of employee safety measures upon reopening to contain the spread, including domestic and international travel restrictions, work-from-home practices, extensive cleaning protocols, social distancing guidelines, requirement for employees to wear masks and various temporary closures of or reduced operations at our manufacturing and assembly facilities.\nIn addition, the year ended December 31, 2019 included a pre-tax gain of $177 million related to the derecognition of BorgWarner Morse TEC LLC ( Morse TEC\u201d), which was a consolidated wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company that held asbestos and certain other liabilities and was the policyholder of the related insurance assets. Also related to this matter, the Company recorded tax expense as a result of the reversal of the previously recorded deferred tax assets related to the asbestos liabilities of $173 million, resulting in an after-tax gain of $4 million. Refer to Note 21, Contingencies,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information.\nBusiness combinations The Company allocates the cost of an acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess value of the cost of an acquired business over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. The valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results. The Company uses a variety of information sources to determine the value of acquired assets and liabilities including: third-party appraisers for the values and lives of property, identifiable intangibles and inventories; and actuaries for defined benefit retirement plans. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units as of the date of the related acquisition. If goodwill is assigned to more than one reporting unit, the Company utilizes a method that is consistent with the manner in which the amount of goodwill in a business combination is determined. Costs related to the acquisition of a business are expensed as incurred.\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in discount rate for Company sponsored U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans on its pension obligations:\nIn addition to the above primary assumptions, the Company notes the following risks to volume and operating income assumptions that could have an impact on the discounted cash flow models:\n\u2022Discount rate: the Company used a 11.7% weighted average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d) as the discount rate for future cash flows. The WACC is intended to represent a rate of return that would be expected by a market participant.\nNon-comparable items impacting the Company's earnings per diluted share and net earnings\n\u2022The Company is dependent on market segments that use our key products and would be affected by decreasing demand in those segments.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $866 million and $489 million in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to cash outflows related to the 2020 acquisition of Delphi Technologies. Capital expenditures, including tooling outlays, were $40 million lower in 2020 primarily due to lower overall spending as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by capital expenditures in the Company's fourth quarter from the acquisition of Delphi Technologies.\nSegment Adjusted EBIT is the measure of segment income or loss used by the Company. The Company believes Segment Adjusted EBIT is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our reporting segments. The following table shows Segment Adjusted EBIT for the Company's reporting segments.\nWe continue to monitor the evolving situation and guidance from international and domestic authorities, including federal, state and local public health authorities and may take additional actions based on their recommendations. In these circumstances, there may be developments outside our control requiring us to adjust our operating plan. To date, COVID-19 has had a material adverse impact on our revenue and overall profitability, primarily in the quarter ended June 30, 2020. Significant reductions in automotive or truck production have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on the Company's sales to OEMs. While production levels increased in the third and fourth quarters and revenue and profitability improved, COVID-19 continues to impact our business globally, and it is possible\nIncome taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.\nThe Company allocates resources to each segment based upon the projected after-tax return on invested capital ( ROIC\u201d) of its business initiatives. ROIC is comprised of Segment Adjusted EBIT after deducting notional taxes compared to the projected average capital investment required. Segment Adjusted EBIT is comprised of earnings before interest, income taxes and noncontrolling interest ( EBIT\u201d) adjusted for restructuring, goodwill impairment charges, affiliates' earnings and other items not reflective of ongoing operating income or loss. Segment Adjusted EBIT excludes certain corporate costs which primarily represents headquarters' expenses not directly attributable to the individual segments. Corporate expenses not allocated to Segment Adjusted EBIT were $192 million and $206 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. An increase in corporate expenses related to the acquisition of Delphi Technologies in 2020 was more than offset by savings and actions taken during the year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including decreased compensation expense, resulting in a decrease compared to 2019.\nThe Aftermarket segment's net sales and Segment Adjusted EBIT for the three months ended December 31, 2020 were $194 million and $22 million, respectively. The Segment Adjusted EBIT margin was 11.3% in the three months ended December 31, 2020. This is a new reporting segment following the acquisition of Delphi Technologies on October 1, 2020.\nThe effective tax rate was approximately 41% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Unfavorably impacting the effective tax rate in 2020 was income tax expense related to final U.S. Department of Treasury regulations issued in the third quarter of 2020, that impacted the net tax on remittance of foreign earnings and certain tax law changes in India effective in the first quarter of 2020. In addition, we recognized incremental valuation allowances of $53 million in 2020. Also unfavorably impacting the effective tax rate were certain restructuring expenses and merger and acquisition related transaction costs that were non-deductible for tax purposes. Excluding the impact of non-comparable items, the Company's annual effective tax rate associated with ongoing operations was 32% for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nSimilar to goodwill, the Company can elect to perform the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (primarily trade names) using a qualitative analysis, considering similar factors as outlined in the goodwill discussion in order to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the trade names is less than the respective carrying values. If the Company elects to perform or is required to perform a quantitative analysis, the test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date. The Company estimates the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief-from-royalty method, which it believes is an appropriate and widely used valuation technique for such assets. The fair value derived from the relief-from-royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trade names and not being required to pay a royalty for their use.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties ( PRPs\u201d) at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ( Superfund\u201d) and equivalent state laws and, as such, may presently be liable for the cost of clean-up and other remedial activities at 26 such sites. Responsibility for clean-up and other remedial activities at a Superfund site is typically shared among PRPs based on an allocation formula.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nBorgWarner Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries (the Company\u201d) is a global product leader in clean and efficient technology solutions for combustion, hybrid and electric vehicles. Our products help improve vehicle performance, propulsion efficiency, stability and air quality. These products are manufactured and sold worldwide, primarily to original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs\u201d) of light vehicles (passenger cars, sport-utility vehicles ( SUVs\u201d), vans and light trucks). The Company's products are also sold to other OEMs of commercial vehicles (medium-duty trucks, heavy-duty trucks and buses) and off-highway vehicles (agricultural and construction machinery and marine applications). We also manufacture and sell our products to certain Tier One vehicle systems suppliers and into the aftermarket for light, commercial and off-highway vehicles. The Company operates manufacturing facilities serving customers in Europe, the Americas and Asia and is an original equipment supplier to nearly every major automotive OEM in the world.\nPension and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits\nmake contributions as benefit payments become due. Additionally, $186 million of the net unfunded position at December 31, 2020 relates to the acquired Delphi Technologies Pension Scheme in the United Kingdom, which includes the $137 million contribution as discussed above.\n\nDisclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThe sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the Company's total 2021 U.S. OPEB expense is expected to be negligible, as any increase in interest expense will be offset by net actuarial gains.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company performed an analysis on each reporting unit. Following the acquisition of Delphi Technologies and the resulting reorganization of the business, the Company elected to perform quantitative, step one,\u201d goodwill impairment analyses for certain reporting units to refresh their respective fair values. This requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates. The basis of this goodwill impairment analysis is the Company's annual budget and long-range plan ( LRP\u201d). The annual budget and LRP includes a five-year projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments. Because the projections are estimated over a significant future period of time, those estimates and assumptions are subject to uncertainty. Further, the market valuation\nOn March 13, 2020, the Company amended its multi-currency revolving credit facility, by increasing the size of the facility from $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion and by extending the maturity until March 13, 2025.\n\nCommodity Price Risk\nCash Flows\nRestructuring expense was $203 million and $72 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, primarily related to employee benefit costs. The increase in 2020 was primarily due to increased costs related to the announced closure of two facilities in Europe affecting approximately 550 employees and contractually required severance and stock-based compensation associated with the Delphi Technologies acquisition.\nThe vast majority of cash and cash equivalents held outside the United States is available for repatriation. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred. As of January 1, 2018, funds repatriated from foreign subsidiaries are generally no longer taxable for U.S. federal tax purposes. In light of the treatment of foreign earnings under the Tax Act, the Company recorded a liability for the U.S. federal and applicable state income tax liabilities calculated under the provisions of the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. A deferred tax liability has been recorded for substantially all estimated legally distributable foreign earnings. The Company uses its U.S. liquidity primarily for various corporate purposes, including but not limited to debt service, share repurchases, dividend distributions, acquisitions and divestitures and other corporate expenses.\n\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Update\nThe Company believes it will be able to fund the requirements of these plans through cash generated from operations or other available sources of financing for the foreseeable future.\nOn February 12, 2020, April 29, 2020, July 29, 2020 and November 11, 2020, the Company's Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.17 per share of common stock. These dividends were paid on March 16, 2020, June 15, 2020, September 15, 2020 and December 15, 2020, respectively.\nEffective September 1, 2020, all of the base pay and annual retainer reductions had been eliminated.\nThe Company's defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 715. The determination of the Company's obligation and expense for its pension and other postretirement employee benefits, such as retiree health care, is dependent on certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. Certain assumptions, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rate, rates of increase in compensation and health care costs trends are described in Note 18, Retirement Benefit Plans,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. The effects of any modification to those assumptions are either recognized immediately or amortized over future periods in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Air Management segment's net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $536 million, or 8.6%, and Segment Adjusted EBIT decreased $233 million, or 23.4%, from the year ended December 31, 2019. The Delphi Technologies acquisition increased Air Management revenues by $312 million in 2020. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and of strengthening foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, net sales decreased 13.5% from the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in sales was due to COVID-19 related production slowdowns and shutdowns during the first six months of 2020, partially offset by growing demand for the Company's products. The Segment Adjusted EBIT margin was 13.4% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 16.0% in the year ended December 31, 2019. The Segment Adjusted EBIT margin decrease was primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of increased warranty costs.\n\nhas made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management makes estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, relating to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our most critical accounting policies are discussed below.\nInterest Rate Risk\nRestructuring Restructuring costs may occur when the Company takes action to exit or significantly curtail a part of its operations or implements a reorganization that affects the nature and focus of operations. A restructuring charge can consist of severance costs associated with reductions to the workforce, costs to terminate an operating lease or contract, professional fees and other costs incurred related to the implementation of restructuring activities.\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFuture changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our acquisition valuations and intangible asset and goodwill impairment testing, including discount rates or future operating results and related cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values in the future. An increase in discount rates, a reduction in projected cash flows or a combination of the two could lead to a reduction in the estimated fair values, which may result in impairment charges that could materially affect our financial statements in any given year.\nSegment Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes and Noncontrolling Interest ( Segment Adjusted EBIT\u201d)\nIn April 2020, we implemented a range of actions aimed at temporarily reducing costs and preserving liquidity. These actions included, but were not limited to:\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of a 25 basis-point change (as a percentage of net sales) in the assumed warranty trend on the Company's accrued warranty liability:\nThe Company believes that none of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Generally, this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not material or the liability will be shared with other PRPs, although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter.\n\n\nIn accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from assumptions used are accumulated and generally amortized over future periods. The primary assumptions affecting the Company's accounting for employee benefits under ASC Topics 712 and 715 as of December 31, 2020 are as follows:\n\nThe Company's commercial paper program allows the Company to issue $2.0 billion of short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes under the limits of its multi-currency revolving credit facility. The commercial paper program automatically increased to $2.0 billion upon the closing of the acquisition of Delphi Technologies on October 1, 2020. Under this program, the Company may issue notes from time to time and use the proceeds for general corporate purposes. The Company had no outstanding borrowings under this program as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n________________\nTo date, COVID-19 has surfaced in nearly all regions around the world and has resulted, at times, in travel restrictions, closing of borders and business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas. Many OEMs temporarily suspended certain manufacturing operations, particularly in North America and Europe, due to market conditions and matters associated with COVID-19. Furthermore, COVID-19 has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The continued spread of COVID-19 has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which adversely impact the access to capital and increase the cost of capital.\nThe funded status of all pension plans was a net unfunded position of $501 million and $212 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Of these amounts, $139 million and $107 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were related to plans in Germany, where there is no tax deduction allowed under the applicable regulations to fund the plans; hence, the common practice is to\nThe Company maintains various liquidity sources including cash and cash equivalents and the unused portion of our multi-currency revolving credit agreement. At December 31, 2020, the Company had $1,650 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which $1,088 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our subsidiaries outside of the United States. Cash and cash equivalents held by these subsidiaries is used to fund foreign operational activities and future investments, including acquisitions.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nOutlook\nEquity in affiliates' earnings, net of tax was $18 million and $32 million in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. This line item is driven by the results of our unconsolidated joint ventures, NSK-Warner K.K., Turbo Energy Private Limited ( TEL\u201d) and Delphi-TVS Diesel Systems Ltd. The decrease in equity in affiliates' earnings in the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to lower industry volumes and cost pressures in a reduced market.\nRefer to Note 7, Income Taxes,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding income taxes.\nmodels and other financial ratios used by the Company require certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to the Company's facts and circumstances.\nThe multi-currency revolving credit agreement automatically increased to $2.0 billion upon the closing of the acquisition of Delphi Technologies on October 1, 2020. Additionally, the agreement allows the Company the ability to increase the facility by $1.0 billion with bank group approval. The credit agreement contains customary events of default and one key financial covenant, which is a debt-to-EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. The Company was in compliance with the financial covenant at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under this facility.\nAccounting for income taxes is complex, in part because the Company conducts business globally and therefore files income tax returns in numerous tax jurisdictions. Management judgment is required in determining the Company's worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities, including accruals for unrecognized tax benefits. In calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis, the Company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial performance of the operation recording the net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information. Since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to the Company's valuation allowance may be necessary.\nPension and other postretirement defined benefits The Company provides postretirement defined benefits to a number of its current and former employees. Costs associated with postretirement defined benefits include pension and postretirement health care expenses for employees, retirees and surviving spouses and dependents.\nBased on the assumptions outlined above, the impairment testing conducted in the fourth quarter of 2020 indicated the Company's goodwill assigned to the respective reporting units was not impaired. Future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates from those used in acquisition-related valuations and goodwill impairment testing, including discount rates or future operating results and related cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values in the future. An increase in discount rates, a reduction in projected cash flows or a combination of the two could lead to a reduction in the estimated fair values, which may result in impairment charges that could materially affect our financial statements in any given year.\nProvision for income taxes the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 41.2% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with the rate of 37.1% for the year ended December 31, 2019. For further details, see Note 7, Income Taxes,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is party to various commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints, including matters involving warranty claims, intellectual property claims, general liability and various other risks. It is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the Company will ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal matters or, if not, what the impact might be. The Company's environmental and product liability contingencies are discussed separately below. The Company's management does not expect that an adverse outcome in any of these commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows, although it could be material to the results of operations in a particular quarter.\nThis line item is primarily comprised of operating expense (income) items discussed within the subtitle Non-comparable items impacting the Company's earnings per diluted share and net earnings\u201d below.\nActual returns on German pension assets were 4.3% and 21.0% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 6.0% for the same years ended.\nActual returns on U.K. pension assets were 4.0% and 9.5% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 4.0% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 5% for the year ended in 2019.\nResults By Reporting Segment\nThe effective tax rate was approximately 37% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The effective tax rate for 2019 included an increase in income tax expense of $173 million related to the derecognition of the Morse TEC asbestos-related deferred tax assets and $22 million due to the U.S. Department of the Treasury's issuance of the final regulations in the first quarter of 2019 related to the calculation of the one-time transition tax. The 2019 effective tax rate also included reductions of income tax expense of $19 million related to restructuring expense, $11 million for a global realignment plan, $8 million related to other one-time adjustments and $6 million related to pension settlement loss. Excluding the impact of non-comparable items, the Company's annual effective tax rate was 26% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nWhile the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions, fair value estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Any adjustments required after the measurement period are recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings.\nAs a result of an evaluation of the underlying technologies and management of the business subsequent to the acquisition of Delphi Technologies, the Company reduced the useful life of certain intangible assets during the fourth quarter of 2020 as they no longer provided future economic benefit. This resulted in accelerated amortization expense of $38 million recorded within this line item.\nThe Company's business is comprised of four reporting segments: Air Management, e-Propulsion & Drivetrain, Fuel Injection and Aftermarket.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe Company recorded approximately $54 million in restructuring during the three months ended December 31, 2020, related to legacy Delphi Technologies. In conjunction with the acquisition, there were contractually required severance and post-combination stock-based compensation cash payments to legacy Delphi Technologies executive officers and other employee termination benefits. Additionally, in 2019, legacy Delphi Technologies announced a restructuring plan to reshape and realign its global technical center footprint and reduce salaried and contract staff, with expected charges of up to $175 million. Certain of these actions are subject to consultation with employee works councils and other employee representatives. The majority of these actions are expected to be completed by the end of 2021. Nearly all of the restructuring charges are expected to be cash expenditures.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n360. In assessing long-lived assets for an impairment loss, assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. In assessing long-lived assets for impairment, management generally considers individual facilities the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent. A recoverability review is performed using the undiscounted cash flows if there is a triggering event. If the undiscounted cash flow test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment, management will perform a fair value analysis. Management determines fair value under ASC Topic 820 using the appropriate valuation technique of market, income or cost approach. If the carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.\nFrom a credit quality perspective, the Company had a credit rating of BBB+ from both Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings and Baa1 from Moody's as of December 31, 2019, with a stable outlook from all rating agencies. On January 28, 2020, the Company entered into the agreement to acquire Delphi Technologies. During 2020, due to the recent business disruptions from COVID-19 and uncertainties surrounding the Delphi Technologies acquisition, Standard & Poor's downgraded the Company's rating from BBB+ with a stable outlook to BBB with a negative outlook. Additionally, Moody's and Fitch adjusted their outlooks from stable to negative but have maintained the Company's credit ratings at Baa1 and BBB+, respectively. None of the Company's debt agreements require accelerated repayment in the event of a downgrade in credit ratings.\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). In preparing these financial statements, management\nThe Company generally records costs associated with voluntary separations at the time of employee acceptance. Costs for involuntary separation programs are recorded when management has approved the plan for separation, the employees are identified and aware of the benefits they are entitled to and it is unlikely that the plan will change significantly. When a plan of separation requires approval by or consultation with the relevant labor organization or government, the costs are recorded upon agreement. Costs associated with benefits that are contingent on the employee continuing to provide service are accrued over the required service period.\nFollowing the Delphi Technologies acquisition, to align with the manner in which the business is viewed and managed subsequent to the acquisition, the Company reorganized its management reporting structure. Previously, the Company reported its results under two reporting segments, Engine and Drivetrain, which are now referred to as Air Management and e-Propulsion & Drivetrain, respectively. The former Delphi Technologies Powertrain Products segment was integrated into the Air Management segment and the former Delphi Technologies Electronics & Electrification segment was integrated into the e-Propulsion & Drivetrain segment. The remaining Delphi Technologies segments comprise two additional reporting segments, which are referred to as Fuel Injection and Aftermarket.\n\u2022Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets: The expected long-term rate of return is used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost. The required use of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year. Over time, however, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is designed to approximate actual earned long-term returns. The expected long-term rate of return for pension assets has been determined based on various inputs, including historical returns for the different asset classes held by the Company's trusts and its asset allocation, as well as inputs from internal and external sources regarding expected capital market return, inflation and other variables. The Company also considers the impact of active management of the plans' invested assets. In determining its pension expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company used long-term rates of return on plan assets ranging from 1.5% to 7.7% outside of the U.S. and 6.0% in the U.S.\n(b)Since the timing and amount of payments for funded defined benefit pension plans are usually not certain for future years such potential payments are not shown in this table. Amount contained in More than 5 years\u201d column is for unfunded plans and includes estimated payments through 2030. Refer to Note 18, Retirement Benefit Plans,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for disclosures related to the Company's pension benefits.\nRefer to Note 21, Contingencies,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for further details and information respecting the Company's environmental liability.\nThe Company expects to contribute a total of $20 million to $30 million into its defined benefit pension plans during 2021. Of the $20 million to $30 million in projected 2021 contributions, $6 million are contractually obligated, while any remaining payments would be discretionary.\nRefer to Note 1, Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding new applicable accounting pronouncements.\nThe Company's policy is to fund its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with applicable government regulations and to make additional contributions when appropriate. At December 31, 2020, all legal funding requirements had been met. The Company contributed $174 million, $26 million and $26 million to its defined benefit pension plans in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. On October 1, 2020, as a result of the acquisition of Delphi Technologies, the Company assumed all of the retirement-related liabilities of Delphi Technologies, the most significant of which is the Delphi Technologies Pension Scheme (the Scheme\u201d) in the United Kingdom. On December 12, 2020, the Company entered into a Heads of Terms Agreement (the Agreement\u201d) with the Trustees of the Scheme related to the future funding of the Scheme. Under the Agreement, the Company eliminated the prior schedule of contributions between Delphi Technologies and the Scheme in exchange for a $137 million (\u00a3100 million) one-time contribution into the Scheme Plan by December 31, 2020, which was paid on December 15, 2020. The Agreement also contained other provisions regarding the implementation of a revised asset investment strategy as well as a funding progress test that will be performed every three years to determine if additional contributions need to be made into the Scheme by the Company. At this time, the Company anticipates that no additional contributions will be made into the Scheme until 2026 at the earliest.\n\u2022The Company is subject to risks related to international operations.\nRefer to Note 12, Goodwill And Other Intangibles,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding goodwill.\nThe Tax Act that was signed into law in December 2017 constitutes a major change to the U.S. tax system. The impact of the Tax Act on the Company is based on management's current interpretations of the Tax Act, recently issued regulations and related analysis. The Company's tax liability may be materially different based on regulatory developments. In future periods, our effective tax rate could be subject to additional uncertainty as a result of regulatory developments related to the Tax Act.\nInterest expense was $73 million and $55 million in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to the Company's issuance of $1.1 billion senior notes in June 2020 and the $800 million DT Notes acquired as part of the Delphi Technologies acquisition.\nWe believe that the combination of cash from operations, cash balances, available credit facilities, and the universal shelf registration capacity will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for our current level of operations and our planned operations for the foreseeable future. We will continue to balance our needs for internal growth, external growth, debt reduction and cash conservation.\nThe following table presents a summary of our operating results:\nThe Company estimates the fair value of trade names and developed technology using the relief from royalty method, which calculates the cost savings associated with owning rather than licensing the assets. Assumed royalty rates are applied to projected revenue for the remaining useful lives of the assets to estimate the royalty savings. Assumptions in the determination of the fair value of the developed technology included revenue growth rates, royalty rates, obsolescence factors and discount rates. Assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of the trade name included the revenue growth rates, the royalty rate and discount rate.\nOther postretirement employee benefits primarily consist of postretirement health care benefits for certain employees and retirees of the Company's U.S. operations. The Company funds these benefits as retiree claims are incurred. Other postretirement employee benefits had an unfunded status of $65 million and $81 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nFinancing Activities\nSelling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A\u201d) was $951 million and $873 million, or 9.4% and 8.6% of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. SG&A increased as a result of the three months of activity related to Delphi Technologies following the acquisition on October 1, 2020. The increase related to Delphi Technologies was partially offset by savings and actions taken during the year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn October 1, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of 100% of the outstanding ordinary shares of Delphi Technologies PLC ( Delphi Technologies\u201d) from the shareholders of Delphi Technologies pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Agreement, dated January 28, 2020, as amended on May 6, 2020, by and between the Company and Delphi Technologies (the Transaction Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Agreement, the Company issued, in exchange for each Delphi Technologies share, 0.4307 of a share of common stock of the Company and cash in lieu of any fractional share. In the aggregate, the Company delivered consideration of approximately $2.4 billion, including approximately 37 million shares of common stock of the Company, valued at $1.5 billion, repayment of approximately $900 million of Delphi Technologies' debt and stock-based compensation of approximately $15 million. Upon closing, the Company also assumed approximately $800 million in senior notes as discussed below. The acquisition is expected to strengthen the Company's electronics and power electronics products, capabilities and scale, position the Company for greater growth as electrified propulsion systems gain momentum and enhance key combustion, commercial vehicle and aftermarket product offerings.\nAcquisition of Delphi Technologies PLC\nContractual Obligations\nOperating Activities\nIn April 2019, the Company announced a cost restructuring plan including several actions to reduce existing structural costs. These actions were primarily completed during fourth quarter 2019 and resulted\nThe matters discussed in this Item 7 include forward looking statements. See Forward Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n\u2022The automotive industry is cyclical, and the Company's results of operations would be adversely affected by industry downturns.\n\nForeign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that the Company will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Currently, the Company's most significant currency exposures relate to the Brazil Real, Chinese Renminbi, Euro, Hungarian Forint, Japanese Yen, Korean Won, Mexican Peso and Swedish Krona. The Company mitigates its foreign currency exchange rate risk by establishing local production facilities and related supply chain participants in the markets it serves, by invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of the products and by funding some of its investments in foreign markets through local currency loans. The Company also monitors its foreign currency exposure in each country and implements strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments. In addition, the Company periodically enters into forward currency contracts, cross-currency swaps and foreign currency denominated debt designated as net investment hedges to reduce exposure to translation exchange rate risk. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded a deferred loss of $204 million and a deferred gain of $4 million, respectively, both before taxes, for net investment hedges within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity to a 25 basis-point change in the assumed health care cost trend related to the Company's OPEB obligation and service and interest cost:\n\u2022Operating income margin: the Company used historical and expected operating income margins, which may vary based on the projections of the reporting unit being evaluated.\nInvesting Activities\nThe Fuel Injection segment's net sales and Segment Adjusted EBIT for the three months December 31, 2020 were $479 million and $39 million, respectively. The Segment Adjusted EBIT margin was 8.1% in the three months ended December 31, 2020. This is a new reporting segment following the acquisition of Delphi Technologies on October 1, 2020.\n\u2022Health care cost trend: For postretirement employee health care plan accounting, the Company reviews external data and Company-specific historical trends for health care cost to determine the health care cost trend rate assumptions. In determining the projected benefit obligation for postretirement employee health care plans as of December 31, 2020, the Company used health care cost trend rates of 6.50%, declining to an ultimate trend rate of 4.75% by the year 2025.\nA detailed comparison of the Company's 2018 operating results to its 2019 operating results can be found in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section in the Company's 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed February 13, 2020.\nCOVID-19 could result in adverse impacts in the future. We cannot reasonably estimate the full impacts COVID-19 could have on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future.\nWhile the Company believes that these assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the Company's pension and OPEB and its future expense.\nin approximately $50 million of restructuring expense. The resulting annual gross cost reduction is expected to be in the range of $40 million to $50 million by 2021.\nGoodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets During the fourth quarter of each year, the Company qualitatively assesses its goodwill assigned to each of its reporting units. This qualitative assessment evaluates various events and circumstances, such as macro-economic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, relevant events and financial trends, that may impact a reporting unit's fair value. Using this qualitative assessment, the Company determines whether it is more-likely-than-not the reporting unit's fair value exceeds its carrying value. If it is determined that it is not more-likely-than-not the reporting unit's fair value exceeds the carrying value, or upon consideration of other factors, including recent acquisition, restructuring or divestiture activity or to refresh the fair values, the Company performs a quantitative, step one,\u201d goodwill impairment analysis. In addition, the Company may test goodwill in between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.\nContingencies\nRefer to Note 13, Product Warranty,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding product warranties.\n\u2022reductions in discretionary spending, such as outside professional services and travel.\n\u2022up to 10% temporary base pay reductions for other salaried employees; and\nImpairment of long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets The Company reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets, whether held for use or disposal, including other amortizing intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review under ASC Topic\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $437 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 and net cash used in financing activities was $420 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily driven by the Company's issuance of $1.1 billion in 2.650% senior notes, partially offset by the repayment of the $250 million in 4.625% senior notes and higher share repurchases.\nOur overall outlook for 2021 is positive. The Company expects global industry production to increase year over year due to the negative effects of COVID-19 on 2020 production not recurring in 2021. The Company expects net new business-related sales growth, due to increased penetration of BorgWarner products around the world, to drive a sales increase in line with or greater than the year-over-year increase in industry production. As result, the Company expects increasing revenue in 2021, excluding the impact of foreign currencies and the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. The Company maintains a positive long-term outlook for its global business and is committed to new product development and strategic capital investments to enhance its product leadership strategy.\nThe foreign currency translation adjustments during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are shown in the following table, which provides the percentage change in U.S. dollar against the respective currencies and the approximate impacts of these changes recorded within other comprehensive income (loss) for the respective periods.\nProduct warranties The Company provides warranties on some, but not all, of its products. The warranty terms are typically from one to three years. Provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold. These estimates are established using historical information about the nature, frequency and average cost of warranty claim settlements as well as product manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from third parties. Management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims. Management believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate; however, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to the accrual:\nUnrealized gain on equity securities was $382 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This line item reflects the net unrealized gain recognized during 2020 related to the Company's equity securities in Romeo Systems, Inc. (now known as Romeo Power, Inc.) which became a public company in December 2020.

the MD&A report:\n\n- BorgWarner is a global auto parts supplier that provides products like turbochargers, transmissions, and electrical vehicle components. \n\n- Net sales in 2020 were $10.2 billion, flat compared to 2019. The acquisition of Delphi Technologies added $1.1 billion in Q4 2020 sales, offsetting declines earlier in the year due to COVID-19 shutdowns.\n\n- Net earnings attributable to BorgWarner in 2020 were $500 million or $2.34 per diluted share, compared to $746 million or $3.61 per diluted share in 2019. Earnings were impacted by non-comparable items like restructuring costs, acquisition expenses, and other one-time charges.\n\n- Operating cash flow was $1.2 billion in 2020 versus $1.0 billion in 2019, as lower working capital investments helped offset higher pension contributions. \n\n- The company has four reporting segments: Air Management, e-Propulsion & Drivetrain, Fuel Injection, and Aftermarket. Air Management and e-Propulsion & Drivetrain saw lower sales and profits in 2020 due to COVID-19.\n\n- BorgWarner completed the acquisition of Delphi Technologies in October 2020 for approximately $2.4 billion. This expands their electronics and power electronics capabilities.\n\n- The company expects industry production and BorgWarner sales to increase in 2021 as COVID-19 impacts decline. They maintain a positive long-term outlook based on growth in electrified propulsion systems."}
