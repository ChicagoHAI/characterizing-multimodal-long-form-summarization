MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, and other financial information, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.\nChange in Fiscal Year\nIn June 2014, we elected to change our fiscal year-end from April 30th to December 31st. The change in fiscal year became effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2015 and ending December 31, 2015. As a result of this change, financial results for fiscal year 2015 are compared to the unaudited financial results for calendar year 2014, and the financial results for transition period 2014 are compared to the unaudited financial results for eight months 2013. When financial results for fiscal year 2014 are compared to financial results for fiscal year 2013, the results are presented on the basis of our previous fiscal year-end on a twelve month basis.\nCompany Overview\nFounded in 1975 with a single truck, Casella Waste Systems, Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries and certain partially owned entities over which it has a controlling financial interest, is a regional, vertically-integrated solid waste services company. We provide resource management expertise and services to residential, commercial, municipal and industrial customers, primarily in the areas of solid waste collection and disposal, transfer, recycling and organics services. We provide integrated solid waste services in six states: Vermont, New Hampshire, New York, Massachusetts, Maine and Pennsylvania, with our headquarters located in Rutland, Vermont. We manage our solid waste operations on a geographic basis through two regional operating segments, the Eastern and Western regions, each of which provides a full range of solid waste services, and our larger-scale recycling and commodity brokerage operations through our Recycling segment. Organics services, ancillary operations, industrial services, discontinued operations, and earnings from equity method investees, as applicable, are included in our Other segment.\nAs of January 29, 2016, we owned and/or operated 34 solid waste collection operations, 44 transfer stations, 18 recycling facilities, nine Subtitle D landfills, four landfill gas-to-energy facilities and one landfill permitted to accept C&D materials.\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nAcquisitions\nWe have a dedicated business development team that identifies acquisition candidates, categorizes the opportunity by strategic fit and perceived level of financial accretion, establishes contact with the appropriate representative of the acquisition candidate and gathers further information on the acquisition candidate.\nWe have made in the past, and we may make in the future, acquisitions in order to acquire or develop additional disposal capacity. These acquisitions may include \u201ctuck-in\u201d acquisitions within our existing markets, assets that are adjacent to or outside of our existing markets, or larger, more strategic acquisitions. In addition, from time to time, we may acquire businesses that are complementary to our core business strategy. We face considerable competition for acquisition targets, particularly the larger and more meaningful targets, due to among other things, our limited access to and weighted average cost of capital, but we believe that our strong relationships and reputation in New England and the upstate New York area help to offset these factors.\nThere were no acquisitions in fiscal year 2015.\nDuring transition period 2014, we acquired one solid waste hauling operation in each of the Eastern and Western regions for total consideration of $0.4 million, including $0.3 million in cash and $0.1 million in holdbacks to the sellers.\nWe acquired various businesses during fiscal year 2014, including several solid waste hauling operations, a transfer station, a MRF and an industrial service management business (included in the Other segment) for total consideration of $10.1 million, including $7.9 million in cash, $1.7 million in contingent consideration and holdbacks to the sellers and $0.5 million of other non-cash considerations. We recovered $0.2 million of the purchase price holdback amount we had previously paid and were relieved of any potential contingent consideration obligation associated with the acquisition of an industrial service management business earlier in fiscal year 2014. As a result, we recorded a $1.1 million gain on settlement of acquisition related contingent consideration in fiscal year 2014.\nWe acquired various solid waste hauling operations during fiscal year 2013, including the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of BBI in the Eastern region, for total consideration of $27.9 million in cash and approximately 0.6 million shares of our Class A common stock, valued at an aggregate of $2.7 million. We recorded an additional $5.1 million to goodwill for the increased deferred tax liability related to the BBI acquisition based on the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amount recognized for income tax purposes. See Note 14, Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. The acquisition of BBI, a provider of solid waste collection, transfer and liquid waste services in New Hampshire and Maine, provided us the opportunity to internalize additional waste and recyclables and to consolidate operations, routes and transportation within the Eastern region.\nDivestitures\nFrom time to time, we may sell or divest certain investments or other components of our business. These divestitures may be undertaken for a number of reasons, including: to generate proceeds to pay down debt; as a result of a determination that the specified asset will provide inadequate returns to us or that the asset no longer serves a strategic purpose in connection with our business; or as a result of a determination that the asset may be more valuable to a third-party. We will continue to look to divest certain activities and investments that no longer enhance or complement our core business if the right opportunity presents itself.\nSale of Business. In fiscal year 2015, we divested a business, which included the sale of certain assets associated with various waste collection routes in the Western region, for total consideration of $0.9 million, resulting in a gain of $0.6 million.\nCARES and Related Transaction. We executed a purchase and sale agreement in fiscal year 2015 pursuant to which we and Altela agreed to sell certain assets of the CARES water treatment facility to a third-party. We sold these assets of CARES for purchase consideration of $3.5 million, resulting in a gain of $2.9 million in fiscal year 2015, 49% of which was attributable to Altela, the noncontrolling interest holder. As of December 31, 2015, we continued to pursue the dissolution of CARES in accordance with the CARES agreement.\nIn connection with this transaction, we also sold certain of our equipment and real estate to the same unrelated third-party for total consideration of $1.1 million, resulting in a gain of $0.9 million in fiscal year 2015.\nThere were no divestitures in transition period 2014.\nGreenFiber. In fiscal year 2014, we and LP executed a purchase and sale agreement with a limited liability company formed by Tenex Capital Partners, L.P., pursuant to which we and LP agreed to sell our membership interests in GreenFiber for total cash consideration of $18.0 million plus an expected working capital true-up less any indebtedness and other unpaid transaction costs of GreenFiber as of the closing date. The transaction was completed for $19.2 million in gross cash proceeds, including a $1.2 million working capital adjustment. After netting indebtedness of GreenFiber and transaction costs, our 50% of the net cash proceeds amounted to $3.4 million. After considering the $0.6 million impact of our unrealized losses relating to derivative instruments in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our investment in GreenFiber, we recorded a gain on sale of equity method investment of $0.6 million in fiscal year 2014. We had previously accounted for our 50% membership interest in GreenFiber using the equity method of accounting.\nMaine Energy. In fiscal year 2013, we executed a purchase and sale agreement with the City of Biddeford, Maine, pursuant to which we agreed to sell the real property of Maine Energy to the City of Biddeford. We agreed to sell Maine Energy for an undiscounted purchase consideration of $6.7 million, which is being paid to us in installments over twenty-one years. Later in fiscal year 2013, we closed the transaction, ceased operations of the Maine Energy facility, and initiated the decommissioning, demolition and site remediation process in accordance with the provisions of the agreement. In fiscal year 2015, we completed the demolition process and site remediation under the auspices and in accordance with work plans approved by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection and the EPA. Based on the total incurred costs to fulfill our obligation under the agreement, we reversed a reserve of $1.1 million of excess costs to complete the divestiture in fiscal year 2015.\nBioFuels. In fiscal year 2013, we initiated a plan to dispose of BioFuels and as a result, the assets associated with BioFuels were classified as held-for-sale and the results of operations were recorded as income from discontinued operations. Assets of the disposal group previously classified as held-for-sale, and subsequently included in discontinued operations, included certain inventory along with plant and equipment. In fiscal year 2014, we executed a purchase and sale agreement with ReEnergy Lewiston LLC (\u201cReEnergy\u201d), pursuant to which we agreed to sell certain assets of BioFuels, which was located in our Eastern region, to ReEnergy. We agreed to sell the BioFuels assets for undiscounted purchase consideration of $2.0 million, which was to be paid to us in equal quarterly installments over five years commencing November 1, 2013, subject to the terms of the purchase and sale agreement. The related note receivable was paid in full by ReEnergy in transition period 2014. We recognized a $0.4 million loss on disposal of discontinued operations in fiscal year 2014 associated with the disposition. As a part of the divestiture, we agreed to complete certain site improvements at Biofuels, which were completed in transition period 2014. As a result, we recorded a $0.6 million gain in transition period 2014 associated with reversing the excess remaining reserves not needed to complete the site improvements.\nResults of Operations\nThe

Revenues\nWe manage our solid waste operations, which include a full range of solid waste services, on a geographic basis through two regional operating segments, which we designate as the Eastern and Western regions. Revenues in our Eastern and Western regions consist primarily of fees charged to customers for solid waste collection and disposal, landfill, landfill gas-to-energy, transfer and recycling services. We derive a substantial portion of our collection revenues from commercial, industrial and municipal services that are generally performed under service agreements or pursuant to contracts with municipalities. The majority of our residential collection services are performed on a subscription basis with individual households. Landfill and transfer customers are charged a tipping fee on a per ton basis for disposing of their solid waste at our disposal facilities and transfer stations. We also generate and sell electricity at certain of our landfill facilities. In addition, revenues from our Recycling segment consist of revenues derived from municipalities and customers in the form of processing fees, tipping fees and commodity sales. Organics services, ancillary operations, major account and industrial services, discontinued operations, and earnings from equity method investees, as applicable, are included in our Other segment. Our revenues are shown net of inter-company eliminations.\nThe table below shows revenue attributable to services provided (in millions) for the following periods:\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td> </td>

In fiscal year 2015, we divested a business, which included the sale of certain assets associated with various waste collection routes in the Western region, for total consideration of $0.9 million, resulting in a gain of $0.6 million.\nMaine Energy. In fiscal year 2013, we executed a purchase and sale agreement with the City of Biddeford, Maine, pursuant to which we agreed to sell the real property of Maine Energy to the City of Biddeford. We agreed to sell Maine Energy for an undiscounted purchase consideration of $6.7 million, which is being paid to us in installments over twenty-one years. Later in fiscal year 2013, we closed the transaction, ceased operations of the Maine Energy facility, and initiated the decommissioning, demolition and site remediation process in accordance with the provisions of the agreement. In fiscal year 2015, we completed the demolition process and site remediation under the auspices and in accordance with work plans approved by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection and the EPA. Based on the total incurred costs to fulfill our obligation under the agreement, we reversed a reserve of $1.1 million of excess costs to complete the divestiture in fiscal year 2015.\nCARES and Related Transaction. CARES is a joint venture that owned and operated a water and leachate treatment facility for the natural gas drilling industry in Pennsylvania. Our joint venture partner in CARES is Altela. As of December 31, 2015, our ownership interest in CARES is 51%. In accordance with the FASB ASC 810-10-15, we consolidate the assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interest and results of operations of CARES into our consolidated financial statements due to our controlling financial interest in the joint venture.\nIn fiscal year 2014, we determined that assets of the CARES water treatment facility were no longer operational or were not operating within product performance parameters. As a result, we initiated a plan to abandon and shut down the operations of CARES. It was determined that the carrying value of the assets of CARES was no longer recoverable and, as a result, the carrying value of the asset group was assessed for impairment and impaired. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $7.5 million in each of fiscal year 2014 and calendar year 2014 to the asset group of CARES in the Western region.\nWe executed a purchase and sale agreement in fiscal year 2015 pursuant to which we and Altela agreed to sell certain assets of the CARES water treatment facility to a third-party. We sold these assets of CARES for purchase consideration of $3.5 million, resulting in a gain of $2.9 million in fiscal year 2015, 49% of which was attributable to Altela, the noncontrolling interest holder. As of December 31, 2015, we continued to pursue the dissolution of CARES in accordance with the CARES agreement.\nIn connection with this transaction, we also sold certain of our equipment and real estate to the same third-party for total consideration of $1.1 million, resulting in a gain of $0.9 million in fiscal year 2015.\nBioFuels. As a part of the disposition of BioFuels, we agreed to complete certain site improvements that were completed in transition period 2014. As a result, we recorded a $0.6 million gain in each of transition period 2014 and calendar year 2014 associated with reversing the excess remaining reserves not needed to complete the site improvements.\nContract Settlement Charge\nIn fiscal year 2015, we recorded a contract settlement charge of $1.9 million associated with the Expera Old Town, LLC v. Casella Waste Systems, Inc. legal matter. See Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further disclosure.\nDevelopment Project Charge\nIn each of fiscal year 2014 and calendar year 2014, we recorded a charge of $1.4 million for deferred costs associated with a gas pipeline development project no longer deemed viable.\nEnvironmental Remediation Charge\nIn each of transition period 2014 and calendar year 2014, we recorded an environmental remediation charge of $1.0 million associated with remediation performed at our Southbridge landfill in the Eastern region. We had previously recorded an environmental remediation charge of $0.4 million in eight month period 2013 and fiscal year 2014 associated with remediating this site.\nSeverance and Reorganization Costs\nIn calendar year 2014, eight month period 2013 and fiscal year 2014, we recorded charges of $0.4 million, $0.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively, for severance costs associated with various planned reorganization efforts including the divestiture of Maine Energy.\nIn fiscal 2013, we recorded a charge of $3.7 million for severance costs associated primarily with the realignment of our operations in order to streamline functions and improve our cost structure, the closure of Maine Energy and a reorganization of senior management. Through the realignment of our operations we improved certain aspects of the sales function to facilitate customer service and retention, pricing growth and support of strategic growth initiatives; align transportation, route management and maintenance functions at the local level; and reduce corporate overhead and staff to match organizational needs and reduce costs.\nExpense from Divestiture, Acquisition and Financing Costs\nThe $0.1 million expense from divestiture, acquisition and financing costs recorded in each of eight month period 2013 and fiscal year 2014 is primarily associated with legal costs related to the acquisition of the remaining 50% membership interest of Tompkins.\nThe $1.4 million expense from divestiture, acquisition and financing costs recorded in fiscal year 2013 is associated with the following fiscal year 2013 events: a $0.3 million write-off of costs associated with the full refinancing of our 11.0% senior second lien notes (\u201cSecond Lien Notes\u201d) in fiscal year 2013, $0.6 million of legal costs associated with the Maine Energy divestiture transaction, and $0.5 million of costs associated with the BBI acquisition.\nGain on Settlement of Acquisition Related Contingent Consideration\nIn each of fiscal year 2014 and calendar year 2014, we recovered a portion of the purchase price holdback amount we had previously paid and were relieved of any potential contingent consideration obligation associated with the acquisition of an industrial service management business earlier in fiscal year 2014. As a result, we recorded a $1.1 million gain on settlement of acquisition related contingent consideration in each of fiscal year 2014 and calendar year 2014.\nOther Expenses\nInterest Expense, net\nInterest Expense, net - Fiscal Year 2015 compared to Unaudited Calendar Year 2014\nOur interest expense, net increased $2.0 million in fiscal year 2015 as compared to calendar year 2014 due to higher average debt balances combined with changes to our capitalization structure associated with various tax exempt debt borrowings, the issuance of additional 2019 Notes and the refinancing of our Senior Credit Facility. In fiscal year 2015, we also experienced interest savings when we repurchased and permanently retired $14.7 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes, our most expensive debt, at a weighted average repurchase price of $101.0.\nInterest Expense, net - Transition Period 2014 compared to Unaudited Eight Month Period 2013\nOur interest expense, net increased $0.2 million in transition period 2014 as compared to eight month period 2013 as interest expense associated with higher average debt balances in transition period 2014 was partially offset by interest savings associated with a reduction to our outstanding letters of credit.\nInterest Expense, net - Fiscal Year 2014 compared to Fiscal Year 2013\nOur interest expense, net decreased $3.5 million in fiscal year 2014 when compared to fiscal year 2013. The decrease in interest expense, net during fiscal year 2014 can primarily be attributed to lower interest rates associated with the refinancing in October and November 2012 of $180.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Second Lien Notes. Interest savings were partially offset by an increase in interest expense associated with higher average debt balances in fiscal year 2014, associated primarily with borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility to help fund operations and meet cash flow needs.\nLoss from Equity Method Investment and Gain on Sale of Equity Method Investment\nIn December 2013, we sold our 50% membership interest in GreenFiber and purchased the remaining 50% membership interest of Tompkins, both of which were previously accounted for using the equity method of accounting.\nAs a result of the sale of our 50% membership interest in GreenFiber, we recorded a gain on sale of equity method investment of $0.8 million in eight month period 2013, which included a $0.2 million working capital adjustment to the purchase price that was finalized upon closing of the transaction in January 2014. We had initially recorded a gain on sale of equity method investment of $0.6 million in fiscal year 2014 as a result of the sale.\nWe no longer account for our investment in Tompkins using the equity method of accounting and began including the accounts of Tompkins in our consolidated financial statements.\nPrior to these transactions, we recorded income from equity method investments of $0.1 million in calendar year 2014 and losses from our equity method investments of $1.0 million, $0.9 million and $4.4 million in eight month period 2013, fiscal year 2014 and fiscal year 2013.\nImpairment of Investments\nAs of December 31, 2015, we owned 5.3% of the outstanding common stock of Recycle Rewards, Inc. (\u201cRecycle Rewards\u201d), a company that markets an incentive based recycling service. In both fiscal year 2015 and transition period 2014, it was determined based on the operating performance of Recycle Rewards that our cost method investment in Recycle Rewards was potentially impaired. As a result, we performed a valuation analysis in fiscal year 2015, and had a valuation analysis performed by a third-party valuation specialist in transition period 2014, both of which used an income approach based on discounted cash flows to determine an equity value for Recycle Rewards in order to properly value our cost method investment in Recycle Rewards. Based on these analyses, it was determined in each case that the fair value of our cost method investment in Recycle Rewards was less than the carrying amount and, therefore, we recorded other-than-temporary investment impairment charges of $1.1 million in fiscal year 2015 and $2.3 million in each of calendar year 2014 and transition period 2014. As of December 31, 2015, the carrying amount of our cost method investment in Recycle Rewards is $1.1 million.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we owned 9.8% of the outstanding equity value of GreenerU, Inc. (\u201cGreenerU\u201d), a services company focused on providing energy efficiency, sustainability and renewable energy solutions to colleges and universities. In fiscal year 2015, it was determined based on the operating performance and recent third-party interest in GreenerU that our cost method investment in GreenerU was potentially impaired. A valuation analysis was performed by a third-party valuation specialist using a market approach based on an option pricing methodology to determine an equity value and fair market value per share for GreenerU. Based on this analysis, it was determined that the fair value of our cost method investment in GreenerU was less than the carrying amount and, therefore, we recorded an other-than-temporary investment impairment charge of $0.7 million in fiscal year 2015. As of December 31, 2015, the carrying amount of our cost method investment in GreenerU is $0.3 million.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we owned 17.0% and 16.2% of the outstanding common stock of AGreen Energy LLC (\u201cAGreen\u201d) and BGreen Energy LLC (\u201cBGreen\u201d), respectively. In fiscal year 2015, AGreen and BGreen, both of which we account for as cost method investments, entered into agreements that resulted in the contribution and sale of certain assets and liabilities of AGreen and BGreen to a limited liability company in exchange for partial ownership interests in a parent of that limited liability company. As a result of the transactions, we performed an analysis to determine whether an other-than-temporary impairment in the carrying value of our cost method investments had occurred. Based on the analysis performed, which measured the fair value of our cost method investments using an in-exchange valuation premise under the market approach that utilized the estimated purchase consideration received, we recorded an other-than-temporary investment impairment charge of $0.3 million in fiscal year 2015.\nLoss on Derivative Instruments\nIn the fiscal year ended April 30, 2012, we entered into two forward starting interest rate derivative agreements that were initially being used to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the forecasted financing transaction to redeem our Second Lien Notes. The total notional amount of these agreements was $150.0 million and required us to receive interest based on changes in LIBOR and pay interest at a rate of approximately 1.40%. During fiscal year 2013, we dedesignated both of the $75.0 million forward starting interest rate derivative agreements and discontinued hedge accounting in accordance with FASB ASC 815-30 because the interest payments associated with the forecasted financing transaction were no longer deemed probable. We recognized a $3.6 million loss, reclassified\nfrom accumulated other comprehensive loss, as loss on derivative instruments in fiscal year 2013 and recognize the change in fair value of the interest rate swaps along with any cash settlements through earnings as gain or loss on derivative instruments. The agreements were both scheduled to mature on March 15, 2016. However, in February 2015 we settled one of the forward starting interest rate derivative agreements for $0.8 million.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment\nSenior Subordinated Notes. In fiscal year 2015, we repurchased and permanently retired $14.7 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes at a weighted average repurchase price of $101.0 in order to maximize interest savings by paying down our most expensive debt. As a result of the repurchases, we recorded a charge of $0.5 million in fiscal year 2015 as a loss on debt extinguishment primarily related to the non-cash write off of deferred financing costs and unamortized original issue discount in proportion with the settlement amount.\nSenior Credit Facility. In fiscal year 2015, we recorded a charge of $0.5 million as a loss on debt extinguishment related to the write-off of deferred financing costs in connection with changes to the borrowing capacity from the Senior Credit Facility to the ABL Facility. The remaining unamortized deferred financing costs of the Senior Credit Facility, along with fees paid to the creditor and third-party costs incurred for the ABL Facility, are to be amortized over the term of the ABL Facility.\nSecond Lien Notes. In fiscal year 2013, we recorded a charge of $15.6 million as a loss on debt extinguishment related to the full refinancing of our Second Lien Notes. The loss on debt extinguishment consisted of a $2.8 million non-cash write off of deferred financing costs, a $2.1 million non-cash write off of the unamortized original issue discount and a $10.7 million charge associated with the early tender premium and tender fees associated with the redemption of the Second Lien Notes.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nOur provision for income taxes from continuing operations for fiscal year 2015 increased $0.1 million to $1.4 million from $1.3 million in calendar year 2014. The provision (benefit) for income taxes decreased $0.5 million in transition period 2014 to $0.7 million from $1.2 million in eight month period 2013, and increased $4.3 million in fiscal year 2014 to $1.8 million from ($2.5) million in fiscal year 2013. The provisions for income taxes for fiscal year 2015 and calendar year 2014 include deferred tax provisions of $0.8 and $1.2 million, respectively, and transition period 2014 and eight month period 2013 include deferred tax provisions of $0.6 million and $1.0 million, respectively. The change in the provisions for income taxes and the total deferred tax provisions in these periods are primarily related to the deferred tax liability for indefinite lived assets. Since we cannot determine when the deferred tax liability related to indefinite lived assets will reverse, this amount cannot be used as a future source of taxable income against which to benefit deferred tax assets. The change in the provisions (benefits) for income taxes for fiscal year 2014 and fiscal year 2013 is primarily related to a ($5.1) million deferred tax benefit in fiscal year 2013 due to a reduction of the valuation allowance in connection with the recording of deferred tax liabilities related to the BBI acquisition, offset by $0.8 million in fiscal year 2013 related to a settlement with the State of New York for corporate franchise tax for tax years April 30, 2004 through April 30, 2010.\nDiscontinued Operations\nIncome (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, net\nDiscontinued operations in eight month period 2013 and fiscal years 2014 and 2013 represent the result of operations related to the business disposition of BioFuels. In fiscal year 2014, we executed a purchase and sale agreement with ReEnergy, pursuant to which we agreed to sell certain assets of BioFuels, which is located in our Eastern region, to ReEnergy.\nOur loss from discontinued operations, net in fiscal year 2013 includes a $3.3 million loss associated with the adjustment to the carrying value of BioFuels to its fair value as a result of the planned business disposition of BioFuels.\nThe operating results of the operations discussed above have been included in discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nLoss on Disposal of Discontinued Operations\nWe recognized a $0.4 million loss on disposal of discontinued operations in fiscal year 2014 associated with the BioFuels disposition.\nSegment Reporting\nThe

Cash flows used in discontinued operations decreased $2.2 million for fiscal year 2014 when compared to fiscal year 2013. These fluctuations in net cash flows from discontinued operations are the result of the business disposition of BioFuels in exchange for a $2.0 million note receivable, which was to be paid to us in equal quarterly installments commencing November 1, 2013.\nOutstanding Long-Term Debt\nAsset-Based Lending Facility\nThe ABL Facility consists of a revolving credit facility with loans thereunder being available up to an aggregate principal amount of $190.0 million, subject to availability under a borrowing base formula as defined in the ABL Facility agreement. We have the right to request, at our discretion, an increase in the amount of loans under the ABL facility by an aggregate amount of $100.0 million, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the ABL Facility agreement. Interest accrues at LIBOR plus between 1.75% and 2.50%, subject to the terms of the ABL Facility agreement and is set at LIBOR plus 2.25% as of December 31, 2015. The ABL Facility matures on February 26, 2020. If we fail to refinance the 2019 Notes on or before November 16, 2018, the maturity date of the ABL Facility will be November 16, 2018. The ABL Facility is guaranteed jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally by all of our significant wholly-owned subsidiaries and is collateralized by certain qualified accounts receivable-trade, inventory and property, plant and equipment.\nThe ABL Facility agreement requires us to maintain minimum consolidated EBITDA for the twelve months preceding the measurement date measured at the end of each fiscal quarter. Minimum consolidated EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that should not be considered an alternative to any measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the minimum consolidated EBITDA financial covenant contained in the ABL Facility agreement as follows (in millions):\nTable 211: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset-Based Revolving Credit Facility Financial Covenants\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Covenant Requirements at\nDecember 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Minimum consolidated EBITDA (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>110.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75.0 Min. </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td> Minimum consolidated EBITDA is based on operating results for the twelve months preceding the measurement date, December 31, 2015.

Given the cash flow impact that this seasonality, the capital intensive nature of our business and the timing of debt payments has on our business, we typically incur higher debt borrowings from the ABL Facility in order to meet our liquidity needs during these times. Consequently, our availability and performance against our financial covenants tighten during these times as well.\nIn addition to the financial covenants described above, the ABL Facility agreement also contains a number of important customary affirmative and negative covenants which restrict, among other things, our ability to sell assets, incur additional debt, create liens, make investments, and pay dividends. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all covenants under the ABL Facility agreement. We do not believe that these restrictions impact our ability to meet future liquidity needs.\nTax-Exempt Financings\nNew York Bonds\nIn transition period 2014, we completed a financing transaction involving the issuance of $25.0 million in aggregate principal amount of New York Bonds. We borrowed the proceeds of the New York Bonds to repay borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility for qualifying property, plant and equipment assets purchased in the state of New York.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding $25.0 million aggregate principal amount of New York Bonds. The New York Bonds, which are unsecured and guaranteed jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally by all of our significant wholly-owned subsidiaries, accrue interest at 3.75% per annum through December 1, 2019, at which time they may be converted from a fixed rate to a variable rate, and interest is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year. An additional $15.0 million aggregate principal amount of New York Bonds may be offered under the same indenture in the future. The New York Bonds mature on December 1, 2044.\nMaine Bonds\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding $21.4 million aggregate principal amount of Finance Authority of Maine Solid Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds Series 2005R-2 (\u201cFAME Bonds 2005R-2\u201d). The FAME Bonds 2005R-2, which are unsecured and guaranteed jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally by all of our significant wholly-owned subsidiaries, accrue interest at 6.25% per annum through January 31, 2017, at which time they may be converted from a fixed to a variable rate, and interest is payable semiannually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year. The FAME Bonds 2005R-2 mature on January 1, 2025.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding $3.6 million aggregate principal amount of Finance Authority of Maine Solid Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds Series 2005R-1 (\u201cFAME Bonds 2005R-1\u201d). The FAME Bonds 2005R-1 are variable rate bonds secured by a letter of credit issued by our administrative agent bank and interest is payable semiannually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year. The FAME Bonds 2005R-1 mature on January 1, 2025. We borrowed the proceeds of the FAME Bonds 2005R-1 and 2005R-2 to pay for certain costs relating to the following: landfill development and construction; the acquisition of vehicles, containers and related equipment for solid waste collection and transportation services; improvements to existing solid waste disposal, hauling, transfer station and other facilities; other infrastructure improvements; and the acquisition of machinery and equipment for solid waste disposal operations owned and operated by us, or a related party, all located in Maine.\nIn fiscal year 2015, we completed a financing transaction involving the issuance of $15.0 million in aggregate principal amount of FAME Bonds 2015. We borrowed the proceeds of the offering of the FAME Bonds 2015 to finance or refinance the costs of certain of our solid waste landfill facilities and solid waste collection, organics and transfer, recycling and hauling facilities, and to pay for the costs of the issuance of the FAME Bonds 2015. As of December 31, 2015, we had $1.3 million of restricted cash reserved for repayment of costs incurred to fund certain capital projects in the State of Maine as a result of this financing.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding $15.0 million aggregate principal amount of FAME Bonds 2015. The FAME Bonds 2015, which are unsecured and guaranteed jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally by all of our significant wholly-owned subsidiaries, accrue interest at 5.125% per annum through August 1, 2025, at which time they may be converted from a fixed to a variable rate, and interest is payable semiannually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year. An additional $15.0 million aggregate principal amount of FAME Bonds 2015 may be offered under the same indenture in the future. The FAME Bonds 2015 mature on August 1, 2035.\nVermont Bonds\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding $16.0 million aggregate principal amount Vermont Economic Development Authority Solid Waste Disposal Long-Term Revenue Bonds Series 2013 (\u201cVermont Bonds\u201d). The Vermont Bonds, which are unsecured and guaranteed jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally by all of our significant wholly-owned subsidiaries, accrue interest at 4.75% per annum through April 1, 2018, at which time they may be converted from a fixed rate to a variable rate, and interest is payable semiannually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The Vermont Bonds mature on April 1, 2036. We borrowed the proceeds of the Vermont Bonds to repay borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility for qualifying property, plant and equipment assets purchased in the state of Vermont.\nNew Hampshire Bonds\nIn transition period 2014, we completed a financing transaction involving the issuance of $11.0 million in aggregate principal amount of New Hampshire Bonds, consisting of the conversion and remarketing of $5.5 million principal amount New Hampshire Bonds from a variable rate to a fixed term rate and the issuance of an additional $5.5 million principal amount fixed term rate New Hampshire Bonds.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding $11.0 million aggregate principal amount of New Hampshire Bonds. The New Hampshire Bonds, which are unsecured and guaranteed jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally by all of our significant wholly-owned subsidiaries, accrue interest at 4.00% per annum through October 1, 2019, at which time they may be converted from a fixed rate to a variable rate, and interest is payable in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The New Hampshire Bonds mature on April 1, 2029. We borrowed the proceeds of the New Hampshire Bonds to repay borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility for qualifying property, plant and equipment assets purchased in the state of New Hampshire.\nSenior Subordinated Notes\nIn fiscal year 2015, we issued an additional $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes. The additional 2019 Notes, which are both fungible and issued under the same indenture as the $325.0 million 2019 Notes previously issued, were issued at a discount of $0.5 million to be accreted over the remaining term of the 2019 Notes. We used the net proceeds from this issuance, together with the initial borrowings under our new ABL Facility, to refinance our Senior Credit Facility. Additionally, in fiscal year 2015, we repurchased and permanently retired $14.7 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes at a weighted average repurchase price of $101.0 in order to maximize interest savings by paying down our most expensive debt.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding $370.3 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes, which will mature on February 15, 2019. The 2019 Notes accrue interest at the rate of 7.75% per annum and interest is payable semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The 2019 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by substantially all of our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee our ABL Facility.\nThe indenture governing the 2019 Notes contains certain negative covenants which restrict, among other things, our ability to sell assets, make investments in joint ventures, pay dividends, repurchase stock, incur debt, grant liens and issue preferred stock. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all covenants under the indenture governing the 2019 Notes, and we do not believe that these restrictions impact our ability to meet future liquidity needs except that they may impact our ability to increase our investments in non-wholly owned entities, including the joint ventures to which we are already party.\nShelf Registration\nWe have filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC pursuant to which we may from time to time issue securities in an amount of up to $190.0 million, after giving consideration to the $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of additional 2019 Notes we issued in February 2015 pursuant to this registration statement.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands) and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years:\nTable 218: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\none year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 - 3 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 - 5 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than 5\nyears </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt and capital leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,448 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,489 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>429,382 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92,699 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>525,018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest obligations (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,940 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71,700 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,582 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,114 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>179,336 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cancellable operating leases (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,591 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,792 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,737 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>117,224 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>200,344 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capping / closure / post-closure\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>732 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,399 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,577 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>113,691 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>129,399 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual cash obligations (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 55,711 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 112,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 486,278 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 379,728 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,034,097 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td>Based on debt and capital lease balances as of December 31, 2015.

Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with the unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2015, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates as to the timing of cash settlements. For a description of our commitments and contingencies, see Note 8, Final Capping, Closure and Post-Closure Costs, Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies and Note 14, Income Taxes, of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInflation\nAlthough inflationary increases in costs have affected our historical operating margins, we believe that inflation generally has not had a significant impact on our operating results. Consistent with industry practice, most of our contracts provide for a pass-through of certain costs to our customers, including increases in landfill tipping fees and in some cases fuel costs, intended to mitigate the impact of inflation on our operating results. We have also implemented a number of operating efficiency programs that seek to improve productivity and reduce our service costs and a fuel and oil recovery fee, which is designed to recover escalating fuel price fluctuations above an annually reset floor. Based on these implementations, we believe we should be able to sufficiently offset most cost increases resulting from inflation. However, competitive factors may require us to absorb at least a portion of these cost increases. Additionally, management's estimates associated with inflation have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities.\nRegional Economic Conditions\nOur business is primarily located in the northeastern United States. Therefore, our business, financial condition and results of operations are susceptible to downturns in the general economy in this geographic region and other factors affecting the region, such as state regulations and severe weather conditions. We are unable to forecast or determine the timing and/or the future impact of a sustained economic slowdown.\nLimitations on Ownership of Notes\nPursuant to Section 2.19 of the indenture governing the 2019 Notes and the provisions of the FAME Bonds 2015, FAME Bonds 2005R-2, New Hampshire Bonds, New York Bonds and Vermont Bonds, no beneficial holder of the 2019 Notes, FAME Bonds 2015, FAME Bonds 2005R-2, New Hampshire Bonds, New York Bonds and/or Vermont Bonds is permitted to knowingly acquire 2019 Notes, FAME Bonds 2015, FAME Bonds 2005R-2, New Hampshire Bonds, New York Bonds and/or Vermont Bonds if such person would own 10% or more of the consolidated debt for which relevant subsidiaries of ours are obligated (and must dispose of 2019 Notes, FAME Bonds 2015, FAME Bonds 2005R-2, New Hampshire Bonds, New York Bonds and/or Vermont Bonds or other debt of ours to the extent such person becomes aware of exceeding such threshold), if such ownership would require consent of any regulatory authority under applicable law or regulation governing solid waste operators and such consent has not been obtained. We will furnish to the holders of the 2019 Notes, FAME Bonds 2015, FAME Bonds 2005R-2, New Hampshire Bonds, New York Bonds and Vermont Bonds, in each quarterly and annual report, the dollar amount of our debt that would serve as the threshold for evaluating a beneficial holder's compliance with these ownership restrictions. As of December 31, 2015, that dollar amount was $51.6 million.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions\nThe preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, as applicable, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of their evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances. Our significant accounting policies are more fully discussed in Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLandfill Accounting\nLandfill Development Costs\nWe estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity (see landfill development costs discussed within the \u201cProperty, Plant and Equipment\u201d accounting policy more fully discussed in Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). The projection of these landfill costs is dependent, in part, on future events. The remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized, net of accumulated airspace amortization, and projections of future purchase and development costs including capitalized interest. The interest capitalization rate is based on our weighted average interest rate incurred on borrowings outstanding during the period.\nUnder life-cycle accounting, all costs related to acquisition and construction of landfill sites are capitalized and charged to expense based on tonnage placed into each site. Landfill permitting, acquisition and preparation costs are amortized on the units-of-consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed. In determining the amortization rate for our landfills, preparation costs include the total estimated costs to complete construction of the landfills' permitted and expansion capacity.\nFinal Landfill Capping, Closure and Post-Closure Costs\nThe cost estimates for final capping, closure and post-closure activities at landfills for which we have responsibility are estimated based on our interpretations of current requirements and proposed or anticipated regulatory changes. We also estimate additional costs based on the amount a third-party would charge us to perform such activities even when we expect to perform these activities internally. We estimate the airspace to be consumed related to each final capping event and the timing of construction related to each final capping event and of closure and post-closure activities. Because landfill final capping, closure and post-closure obligations are measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques, changes in the estimated timing of construction of future landfill final capping and closure and post-closure activities would have an effect on these liabilities, related assets and results of operations.\nFinal capping activities include the installation of liners, drainage, compacted soil layers and topsoil over areas of a landfill where total airspace has been consumed and waste is no longer being received. Final capping activities occur throughout the life of the landfill. Our engineering personnel estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the acreage to be capped, along with the final capping materials and activities required. The estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. The engineers then quantify the landfill capacity associated with each final capping event and the costs for each event are amortized over that capacity as waste is received at the landfill.\nClosure and post-closure costs represent future estimated costs related to monitoring and maintenance of a solid waste landfill after a landfill facility ceases to accept waste and closes. We estimate, based on input from our engineers, lawyers, accounting personnel and consultants, our future cost requirements for closure and post-closure monitoring and maintenance based on our interpretation of the technical standards of the Subtitle D regulations and the air emissions standards under the Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended, as they are being applied on a state-by-state basis. Closure and post-closure accruals for the cost of monitoring and maintenance include site inspection, groundwater monitoring, leachate management, methane gas control and recovery, and operation and maintenance costs to be incurred for a period which is generally for a term of 30 years after final closure of a landfill. In determining estimated future closure and post-closure costs, we consider costs associated with permitted and permittable airspace.\nRemaining Permitted Airspace\nOur engineers, in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and surveyors, are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills. The remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey, which is then used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography.\nExpansion Airspace\nWe currently include unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances. To be considered expansion airspace all of the following criteria must be met:\nTable 222: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>we control the land on which the expansion is sought; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 223: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>all technical siting criteria have been met or a variance has been obtained or is reasonably expected to be obtained; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 224: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>we have not identified any legal or political impediments which we believe will not be resolved in our favor; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 225: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>we are actively working on obtaining any necessary permits and we expect that all required permits will be received; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 226: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>senior management has approved the project. </td> </tr>\n</table> For unpermitted airspace to be included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, the expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above. These criteria are evaluated annually by our engineers, accountants, lawyers, managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits. Once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards, an airspace utilization factor (\u201cAUF\u201d) is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons. The AUF is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys. When we include the expansion airspace in our calculation of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, we include the projected costs for development, as well as the projected asset retirement costs related to final capping, closure and post-closure of the expansion airspace in the amortization basis of the landfill.\nAfter determining the costs and the remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills, we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons. We calculate per ton amortization rates for assets associated with each final capping event, for assets related to closure and post-closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future for each landfill. These rates per ton are updated annually, or more frequently, as significant facts change.\nIt is possible that actual results, including the amount of costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and post-closure activities, our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To the extent that such estimates or related assumptions prove to be significantly different than actual results, lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates, higher final capping, closure or post-closure rates, or higher expenses. Higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs. Most significantly, if it is determined that the expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of the landfill asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment. If it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion permit has become remote, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately.\nEnvironmental Remediation Liabilities\nWe have recorded environmental remediation liabilities representing our estimate of the most likely outcome of the matters for which we have determined that a liability is probable. These liabilities include potentially responsible party investigations, settlements, certain legal and consultant fees, as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up, such as materials and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy. We provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We estimate costs required to remediate sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred based on site-specific facts and circumstances. Estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are developed using third-party environmental engineers or other service providers. Where we believe that both the amount of a particular environmental remediation liability and timing of payments are reliably determinable, we inflate the cost in current dollars until the expected time of payment and discount the cost to present value.\nAccounts Receivable - Trade, Net of Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable - trade represent receivables from customers for collection, transfer, recycling, disposal and other services. Our accounts receivable - trade are recorded when billed or when related revenue is earned, if earlier, and represent claims against third-parties that will be settled in cash. The carrying value of our accounts receivable - trade, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, represents its estimated net realizable value. Estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical collection experience, current trends, credit policy and a review of our accounts receivable - trade by aging category. Our reserve is evaluated and revised on a monthly basis. Past-due accounts receivable-trade are written off when deemed to be uncollectible.\nGoodwill and Other Intangibles\nWe annually assess goodwill impairment at the end of our fiscal year or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. Historically, we have performed our annual goodwill impairment test using our fiscal year-end, or April 30th, as the measurement date. Effective with the change in our fiscal year-end from April 30th to December 31st, we have voluntarily changed our goodwill impairment measurement date from April 30th to December 31st to coincide with the change in our fiscal year-end. The voluntary change in our goodwill impairment measurement date was applied prospectively as it represents the modification of an existing principle based on new facts and circumstances.\nWe may assess whether a goodwill impairment exists using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment. If we perform a qualitative assessment, it involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If based on this qualitative assessment we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we will not perform a quantitative assessment. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative assessment, or two-step impairment test, to determine whether goodwill impairment exists at the reporting unit.\nIn the first step (defined as \u201cStep 1\u201d) of testing for goodwill impairment, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit, which we have determined to be our geographic operating segments, our Recycling segment and our Customer Solutions business, which is included in the Other segment, and compare the fair value with the carrying value of the net assets of each reporting unit. If the fair value is less than its carrying value, then we would perform a second step (defined as \u201cStep 2\u201d) and determine the fair value of the goodwill. In Step 2, the fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit's identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole, as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated.\nTo determine the fair value of each of our reporting units as a whole we use discounted cash flow analyses, which require significant assumptions and estimates about the future operations of each reporting unit. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the determination of appropriate discount rates, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates. The cash flows employed in our discounted cash flow analyses are based on financial forecasts developed internally by management. Our discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of our risk adjusted discount rate, applicable for each reporting unit. In assessing the reasonableness of our determined fair values of our reporting units, we evaluate our results against our current market capitalization\nIf the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value for a reporting unit, an impairment charge would be recorded to earnings. The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. After a goodwill impairment loss is recognized, the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill becomes its new accounting basis.\nIn addition to an annual goodwill impairment assessment, we would evaluate a reporting unit for impairment if events or circumstances change between annual tests indicating a possible impairment. Examples of such events or circumstances include the following:\nTable 227: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>a significant adverse change in legal status or in the business climate; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 228: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 229: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>a more likely than not expectation that a segment or a significant portion thereof will be sold; or </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 230: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within the segment. </td> </tr>\n</table> We elected to perform a quantitative analysis as part of our annual goodwill impairment test in fiscal year 2015. As of December 31, 2015, the Step 1 testing for goodwill impairment performed for the Eastern, Western, Recycling and Customer Solutions reporting units indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount, including goodwill. Furthermore, the Step 1 test indicated that in each case the fair value of the Eastern, Western, Recycling and Customer Solutions reporting units exceeded its carrying value by in excess of 22.9%. We incurred no impairment of goodwill as a result of our annual goodwill impairment tests in fiscal year 2015 and transition period 2014. However, there can be no assurance that goodwill will not be impaired at any time in the future.\nIntangible assets consist primarily of covenants not-to-compete and customer lists. Intangible assets are recorded at fair value and are amortized based on the economic benefit provided or using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Covenants not-to-compete and customer lists are typically amortized over a term of no more than 10 years.\nRecovery of Long-Lived Assets\nWe continually assess whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that may warrant revision of the estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets (other than goodwill) or whether the remaining balances of those assets should be evaluated for possible impairment. Long-lived assets include, for example, capitalized landfill costs, other property and equipment, and identifiable intangible assets. Events or changes in circumstances that may indicate that an asset may be impaired include the following:\nTable 231: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 232: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 233: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset or asset group, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 234: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long-lived asset; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 235: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 236: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life; or </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 237: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>an impairment of goodwill at a reporting unit. </td> </tr>\n</table> There are certain indicators listed above that require significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry when applied to landfill development or expansion. For example, a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit application although the expansion permit is ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace. Therefore, certain events could occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be considered indicators of impairment due to the unique nature of the waste industry.\nIf an impairment indicator occurs, we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. We group our long-lived assets for this purpose at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are primarily independent of the cash flows of other assets or asset groups. If the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value.\nTo determine fair value, we use discounted cash flow analyses and estimates about the future cash flows of the asset or asset group. This analysis includes a determination of an appropriate discount rate, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates. The cash flows employed in our discounted cash flow analyses are typically based on financial forecasts developed internally by management. The discount rate used is commensurate with the risks involved. We may also rely on third-party valuations and or information available regarding the market value for similar assets.\nIf the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment occurs. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized.\nSee Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 16, Divestiture Transactions and Discontinued Operations to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further disclosure.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Entities\nInvestments in unconsolidated entities over which we have significant influence over the investees' operating and financing activities are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, as applicable. Investments in affiliates in which we do not have the ability to exert significant influence over the investees' operating and financing activities are accounted for under the cost method of accounting.\nWe monitor and assess the carrying value of our investments throughout the year for potential impairment and write them down to their fair value when other-than-temporary declines exist. Fair value is generally based on (i) other third-party investors' recent transactions in the securities; (ii) other information available regarding the current market for similar assets and/or (iii) a market or income approach, as deemed appropriate.\nWhen we assess the carrying value of our investments for potential impairment, determining the fair value of our investments is reliant upon the availability of market information and/or other information provided by third-parties to be able to develop an estimate of fair value. Additionally, considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, our estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we, or other holders of these investments, could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different assumptions and/or estimation methodologies could have a significant effect on the estimated fair values. The current estimates of fair value could differ significantly from the amounts presented.\nSee Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further disclosure.\nSelf-Insurance Liabilities and Related Costs\nWe are self-insured for vehicles and workers' compensation with reinsurance coverage limiting our maximum exposure. Our maximum exposure in fiscal year 2015 under the workers' compensation plan was $1.0 million per individual event. Our maximum exposure in fiscal year 2015 under the automobile plan was $1.2 million per individual event. The liability for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, is determined by management with the assistance of a third-party actuary and reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as an accrued liability. We use a third-party to track and evaluate actual claims experience for consistency with the data used in the annual actuarial valuation. The actuarially determined liability is calculated based on historical data, which considers both the frequency and settlement amount of claims. Our estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly different than our ultimate obligations if variables such as the frequency or severity of future events differ significantly from our assumptions.\nSee Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further disclosure.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use estimates to determine our provision for income taxes and related assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances have been established for the possibility that tax benefits may not be realized for certain deferred tax assets. Deferred income taxes are recognized based on the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, calculated using currently enacted tax rates. We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making this determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes.\nWe account for income tax uncertainties according to guidance on the recognition, de-recognition and measurement of potential tax benefits associated with tax positions. We recognize interest and penalties relating to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense.\nSee Note 14, Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further disclosure.\nContingent Liabilities\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings, claims and regulatory matters, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. We determine whether to disclose or accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote, reasonably possible or probable, and whether it can be reasonably estimated. We analyze our litigation and regulatory matters based on available information to assess the potential liabilities. Management's assessment is developed based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies. We accrue for loss contingencies when such amounts are probable and reasonably estimable. If a contingent liability is only reasonably possible, we will disclose the potential range of the loss, if estimable. We record losses related to contingencies in cost of operations or general and administration expenses, depending on the nature of the underlying transaction leading to the loss contingency. Contingent liabilities accounted for under purchase accounting are recorded at their fair values. These fair values may be different from the values we would have otherwise recorded, had the contingent liability not been assumed as part of an acquisition of a business. See Note 4, Business Acquisitions for disclosure over a contingent liability assumed as part of the acquisition of a business.\nSee Note 4, Business Combinations and Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further disclosure.\nStock-Based Compensation\nAll share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period. Stock-based compensation expense is based on the number of awards ultimately expected to vest and is therefore reduced for an estimate of the awards that are expected to be forfeited prior to vesting.\nThe fair value of each stock option is estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimation, including estimates of the expected term option holders will retain their vested stock options before exercising them and the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term.\nSee Note 11, Stockholders Deficit to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further disclosure.\nNew Accounting Standards\nFor a description of the new accounting standards that may affect us, see Note 2, Accounting Changes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "item_7_truncated": " \u2022 Fiscal year 2015 revenues increased from higher volumes due to organic business growth, partially offset by the pass through impact of unfavorable commodity prices in the marketplace. \nTable 200:

million to $1.4 million from $1.3 million in calendar year 2014. The provision (benefit) for income taxes decreased $0.5 million in transition period 2014 to $0.7 million from $1.2 million in eight month period 2013, and increased $4.3 million in fiscal year 2014 to $1.8 million from ($2.5) million in fiscal year 2013. The provisions for income taxes for fiscal year 2015 and calendar year 2014 include deferred tax provisions of $0.8 and $1.2 million, respectively, and transition period 2014 and eight month period 2013 include deferred tax provisions of $0.6 million and $1.0 million, respectively. The change in the provisions for income taxes and the total deferred tax provisions in these periods are primarily related to the deferred tax liability for indefinite lived assets. Since we cannot determine when the deferred tax liability related to indefinite lived assets will reverse, this amount cannot be used as a future source of taxable income against which to benefit deferred tax assets. The change in the provisions (benefits) for income taxes for fiscal year 2014 and fiscal year 2013 is primarily related to a ($5.1) million deferred tax benefit in fiscal year 2013 due to a reduction of the valuation allowance in connection with the recording of deferred tax liabilities related to the BBI acquisition, offset by $0.8 million in fiscal year 2013 related to a settlement with the State of New York for corporate franchise tax for tax years April 30, 2004 through April 30, 2010.\nNet cash used in investing activities. Cash flows used in investing activities decreased by $31.6 million for fiscal year 2014 when compared to fiscal year 2013.\nRecycling revenues increased $4.5 million during transition period 2014 when compared to eight month period 2013.

The change in fiscal year became effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2015 and ending December 31, 2015. As a result of this change, financial results for fiscal year 2015 are compared to the unaudited financial results for calendar year 2014, and the financial results for transition period 2014 are compared to the unaudited financial results for eight months 2013. When financial results for fiscal year 2014 are compared to financial results for fiscal year 2013, the results are presented on the basis of our previous fiscal year-end on a twelve month basis.\n \u2022 Labor and related benefit costs increased $5.7 million due to additional personnel costs associated with acquisitions, growth in our Customer Solutions business, recruitment and relocation, and an increase in incentive compensation costs. \n \u2022 Labor and related benefit costs increased $3.8 million due to: additional labor costs associated with growth in our Customer Solutions business; increased overall healthcare costs; and increased incentive compensation costs. \nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding $370.3 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes, which will mature on February 15, 2019. The 2019 Notes accrue interest at the rate of 7.75% per annum and interest is payable semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The 2019 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by substantially all of our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee our ABL Facility.\nLandfill Development Costs\nSeverance and Reorganization Costs\nRevenues - Fiscal Year 2015 compared to Unaudited Calendar Year 2014\n \u2022 The increase in revenues for transition period 2014 is the result of higher volumes associated with organic business growth. \n \u2022 The closed landfill change component in fiscal year 2015 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of our Worcester landfill, which ceased operations in April 2014 in accordance with its permit. \nOur cost of operations increased $22.6 million, or 0.8% as a percentage of revenues, for transition period 2014 when compared to eight month period 2013.\nPrice.\n \u2022 Labor and related benefit costs increased $3.3 million due to: additional labor costs due to higher collection and transfer station volumes in the Eastern region associated with new municipal contracts and organic customer growth; processing of higher commodity volumes due to new contracts and facilities in the Recycling segment; and lower productivity as a result of prolonged inclement winter weather into the early spring of 2015. \nCustomer solutions revenues\nTax-Exempt Financings\n \u2022 Debt activity. We experienced a reduction in both debt payments, by $208.5 million, due primarily to the full redemption of the Second Lien Notes in fiscal year 2013, and debt borrowings, by $214.7 million, due primarily to the offering of $125.0 million in additional 2019 Notes in fiscal year 2013, resulting in a $6.2 million decrease in cash flows related to debt activity in fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013. \nRecycling revenues decreased $2.0 million during fiscal year 2015 when compared to calendar year 2014. The decrease in revenues is the result of unfavorable commodity prices in the marketplace, partially offset by higher commodity volumes and higher tipping fees.\nThe following table provides details associated with the period-to-period change in revenues (dollars in millions) attributable to services provided:\nVolume.\n \u2022 The acquisitions and divestitures change component in fiscal year 2015 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of increased revenues from the acquisition of a solid waste hauling operations in September 2014, partially offset by decreased revenues associated primarily with an asset exchange in December 2014 and the divestiture of a business in May 2015. \nMaine Bonds\nRegional Economic Conditions\n \u2022 The price change component in transition period 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $0.8 million from favorable collection pricing. \nNet cash provided by operating activities. Cash flows from operating activities increased by $8.3 million during fiscal year 2015 when compared to calendar year 2014.\n \u2022 The closed landfill change component in fiscal year 2015 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of our Worcester landfill, which stopped accepting waste and ceased operations in April 2014 in accordance with its permit.  Fuel and oil recovery fee.\n \u2022 an impairment of goodwill at a reporting unit.  There are certain indicators listed above that require significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry when applied to landfill development or expansion. For example, a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit application although the expansion permit is ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace. Therefore, certain events could occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be considered indicators of impairment due to the unique nature of the waste industry.\nThe most significant items affecting the change in our financing cash flows are summarized below:\n \u2022 Landfill amortization expense increased during transition period 2014 due to: an increase in landfill volumes at our Southbridge landfill in the Eastern region and at certain of our landfills within the Western region; and an increase in estimated final capping and closure costs at our Worcester landfill. \nIn connection with this transaction, we also sold certain of our equipment and real estate to the same unrelated third-party for total consideration of $1.1 million, resulting in a gain of $0.9 million in fiscal year 2015.\nIn fiscal year 2015, we completed a financing transaction involving the issuance of $15.0 million in aggregate principal amount of FAME Bonds 2015. We borrowed the proceeds of the offering of the FAME Bonds 2015 to finance or refinance the costs of certain of our solid waste landfill facilities and solid waste collection, organics and transfer, recycling and hauling facilities, and to pay for the costs of the issuance of the FAME Bonds 2015. As of December 31, 2015, we had $1.3 million of restricted cash reserved for repayment of costs incurred to fund certain capital projects in the State of Maine as a result of this financing.\n (2) Includes obligations related to landfill operating lease contracts. \n \u2022 Maintenance and repair costs increased $3.9 million due to: higher fleet maintenance costs in the Eastern and Western regions and higher facility maintenance costs associated with our Recycling segment and our Eastern region landfills. \n \u2022 The price change component in fiscal year 2015 total solid waste revenues growth is primarily the result of favorable collection pricing. \nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands) and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years:\nAsset-Based Lending Facility\nAs of December 31, 2015, we owned 9.8% of the outstanding equity value of GreenerU, Inc. (\u201cGreenerU\u201d), a services company focused on providing energy efficiency, sustainability and renewable energy solutions to colleges and universities. In fiscal year 2015, it was determined based on the operating performance and recent third-party interest in GreenerU that our cost method investment in GreenerU was potentially impaired. A valuation analysis was performed by a third-party valuation specialist using a market approach based on an option pricing methodology to determine an equity value and fair market value per share for GreenerU. Based on this analysis, it was determined that the fair value of our cost method investment in GreenerU was less than the carrying amount and, therefore, we recorded an other-than-temporary investment impairment charge of $0.7 million in fiscal year 2015. As of December 31, 2015, the carrying amount of our cost method investment in GreenerU is $0.3 million.\nGeneral and Administration - Transition Period 2014 compared to Unaudited Eight Month Period 2013\nIf the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment occurs. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized.\nOther operating income for fiscal year 2014 increased by $3.8 million when compared to fiscal year 2013 as increased revenues, combined with cost savings associated with a change in our organizational and management structure and the head count reduction that took place as a part of the reorganization fiscal year 2013, more than offset increased hauling and transportation costs associated with our Organics business and transportation services and increased third-party direct costs associated with the acquisition of an industrial service management business within our Customer Solutions business.\nDepreciation and Amortization\n \u2022 an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long-lived asset; \nAs of December 31, 2015, we owned 5.3% of the outstanding common stock of Recycle Rewards, Inc. (\u201cRecycle Rewards\u201d), a company that markets an incentive based recycling service. In both fiscal year 2015 and transition period 2014, it was determined based on the operating performance of Recycle Rewards that our cost method investment in Recycle Rewards was potentially impaired. As a result, we performed a valuation analysis in fiscal year 2015, and had a valuation analysis performed by a third-party valuation specialist in transition period 2014, both of which used an income approach based on discounted cash flows to determine an equity value for Recycle Rewards in order to properly value our cost method investment in Recycle Rewards. Based on these analyses, it was determined in each case that the fair value of our cost method investment in Recycle Rewards was less than the carrying amount and, therefore, we recorded other-than-temporary investment impairment charges of $1.1 million in fiscal year 2015 and $2.3 million in each of calendar year 2014 and transition period 2014. As of December 31, 2015, the carrying amount of our cost method investment in Recycle Rewards is $1.1 million.\nThe change in the components of depreciation and amortization expense when comparing fiscal year 2015 to calendar year 2014 can primarily be attributed to the following:\nNew Hampshire Bonds\nSee Note 4, Business Combinations and Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further disclosure.\n \u2022 Direct operational costs increased $1.5 million due to: higher depletion of landfill operating lease obligations associated with increased volumes received at our landfills; an increase in host community fees and royalties; higher equipment rental costs associated with an increase in fleet and landfill equipment rentals; an increase in gas treatment costs at Juniper Ridge; and a lower gain on sale of fixed assets in transition period 2014. \n \u2022 a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life; or \nDuring transition period 2014, we acquired one solid waste hauling operation in each of the Eastern and Western regions for total consideration of $0.4 million, including $0.3 million in cash and $0.1 million in holdbacks to the sellers.\nEastern Region - Fiscal Year 2015 compared to Unaudited Calendar Year 2014\n \u2022 Other: Other charges impacting operating income include the CARES impairment in fiscal year 2014 and severance costs associated with realignment and streamlining of functions to improve our cost structure in fiscal year 2013.  Recycling\nThe period-to-period change in general and administration expenses can be primarily attributed to the following:\nThe $0.1 million expense from divestiture, acquisition and financing costs recorded in each of eight month period 2013 and fiscal year 2014 is primarily associated with legal costs related to the acquisition of the remaining 50% membership interest of Tompkins.\nClosed landfill.\nThe table below shows revenue attributable to services provided (in millions) for the following periods:\n Price.\nWe continually assess whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that may warrant revision of the estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets (other than goodwill) or whether the remaining balances of those assets should be evaluated for possible impairment. Long-lived assets include, for example, capitalized landfill costs, other property and equipment, and identifiable intangible assets. Events or changes in circumstances that may indicate that an asset may be impaired include the following:\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding $21.4 million aggregate principal amount of Finance Authority of Maine Solid Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds Series 2005R-2 (\u201cFAME Bonds 2005R-2\u201d). The FAME Bonds 2005R-2, which are unsecured and guaranteed jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally by all of our significant wholly-owned subsidiaries, accrue interest at 6.25% per annum through January 31, 2017, at which time they may be converted from a fixed to a variable rate, and interest is payable semiannually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year. The FAME Bonds 2005R-2 mature on January 1, 2025.\nThe period-to-period change in general and administration expenses can be primarily attributed to the following:\n\n \u2022 The commodity price and volume change component in fiscal year 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $2.2 million from favorable commodity pricing, primarily within power generation, partially offset by $1.7 million from lower volumes within power generation and processing.  Acquisitions and divestitures.\n \u2022 Change in restricted cash. We added $5.6 million of restricted assets associated with the issuance of the FAME Bonds 2015 that represent restricted cash reserved for repayment of costs incurred to fund certain capital projects in the State of Maine, and used $10.0 million of the restricted cash associated with the issuance of the FAME Bonds 2015 and the $5.8 million of New York State Environmental Facilities Corporation Solid Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds Series 2014 (\u201cNew York Bonds\u201d) issued in calendar year 2014, to pay down ABL Facility borrowings used to finance certain capital projects in the States of New York and Maine. \n \u2022 The acquisitions and divestitures change component in fiscal year 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $16.7 million in increased revenues from acquisitions, primarily associated with our acquisition of BBI in December 2012, and our acquisition of four solid waste hauling operations and a transfer station in fiscal year 2014. Increased revenues were partially offset by $7.4 million in decreased revenues associated with the Maine Energy divestiture.  Closed landfill.\nCARES and Related Transaction. CARES is a joint venture that owned and operated a water and leachate treatment facility for the natural gas drilling industry in Pennsylvania. Our joint venture partner in CARES is Altela. As of December 31, 2015, our ownership interest in CARES is 51%. In accordance with the FASB ASC 810-10-15, we consolidate the assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interest and results of operations of CARES into our consolidated financial statements due to our controlling financial interest in the joint venture.\n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization: Depreciation and amortization costs increased $0.7 million period-to-period primarily due to an increase in landfill amortization associated with higher landfill volumes at certain landfills.  Western Region - Fiscal Year 2014 compared to Fiscal Year 2013\nWhen we assess the carrying value of our investments for potential impairment, determining the fair value of our investments is reliant upon the availability of market information and/or other information provided by third-parties to be able to develop an estimate of fair value. Additionally, considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, our estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we, or other holders of these investments, could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different assumptions and/or estimation methodologies could have a significant effect on the estimated fair values. The current estimates of fair value could differ significantly from the amounts presented.\nThe table below shows, for the periods indicated, the components of depreciation and amortization expense (in millions):\nOur interest expense, net decreased $3.5 million in fiscal year 2014 when compared to fiscal year 2013. The decrease in interest expense, net during fiscal year 2014 can primarily be attributed to lower interest rates associated with the refinancing in October and November 2012 of $180.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Second Lien Notes. Interest savings were partially offset by an increase in interest expense associated with higher average debt balances in fiscal year 2014, associated primarily with borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility to help fund operations and meet cash flow needs.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding $11.0 million aggregate principal amount of New Hampshire Bonds. The New Hampshire Bonds, which are unsecured and guaranteed jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally by all of our significant wholly-owned subsidiaries, accrue interest at 4.00% per annum through October 1, 2019, at which time they may be converted from a fixed rate to a variable rate, and interest is payable in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The New Hampshire Bonds mature on April 1, 2029. We borrowed the proceeds of the New Hampshire Bonds to repay borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility for qualifying property, plant and equipment assets purchased in the state of New Hampshire.\n \u2022 General and administration: General and administration costs increased $0.9 million in fiscal year 2014 primarily due to additional personnel costs associated with the BBI acquisition and an increase in estimated incentive compensation costs. \nStock-Based Compensation\nIn December 2013, we sold our 50% membership interest in GreenFiber and purchased the remaining 50% membership interest of Tompkins, both of which were previously accounted for using the equity method of accounting.\nGeneral and Administration - Fiscal Year 2014 compared to Fiscal Year 2013\n \u2022 Capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were $17.5 million lower in the fiscal year 2015 due to the timing of various landfill development projects, along with various calendar year 2014 capital expenditures associated with a new recycling facility contract, various transfer stations and the installation of a landfill gas treatment system at Juniper Ridge. \nSale of Business. In fiscal year 2015, we divested a business, which included the sale of certain assets associated with various waste collection routes in the Western region, for total consideration of $0.9 million, resulting in a gain of $0.6 million.\nRecycling revenues increased $1.5 million during fiscal year 2014 when compared to fiscal year 2013. The increase in revenues is due to higher commodity volumes and the acquisition of the remaining 50% membership interest of Tompkins.\nThe most significant items affecting the change in our investing cash flows are summarized below:\nWe have filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC pursuant to which we may from time to time issue securities in an amount of up to $190.0 million, after giving consideration to the $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of additional 2019 Notes we issued in February 2015 pursuant to this registration statement.\nDiscontinued Operations\n \u2022 Acquisitions, net of cash acquired. During eight month period 2013, cash outflows associated with acquisitions totaled $8.5 million as compared to $0.4 million in transition period 2014 based on the respective acquisition activity. The timing and size of acquisitions are dependent upon opportunity and our access to capital.  Net cash provided by financing activities. Cash flows provided by financing activities decreased $1.8 million during transition period 2014 when compared to eight month period 2013.\nWe acquired various businesses during fiscal year 2014, including several solid waste hauling operations, a transfer station, a MRF and an industrial service management business (included in the Other segment) for total consideration of $10.1 million, including $7.9 million in cash, $1.7 million in contingent consideration and holdbacks to the sellers and $0.5 million of other non-cash considerations. We recovered $0.2 million of the purchase price holdback amount we had previously paid and were relieved of any potential contingent consideration obligation associated with the acquisition of an industrial service management business earlier in fiscal year 2014. As a result, we recorded a $1.1 million gain on settlement of acquisition related contingent consideration in fiscal year 2014.\n \u2022 a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group; \nEastern Region - Fiscal Year 2014 compared to Fiscal Year 2013\n Price.\n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization: Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $0.1 million due to higher amortization expense associated with an increase in overall landfill tons and changes to certain of our landfill amortization rates as a part of the annual year-end review of our landfills, mostly offset by a decrease in depreciation expense associated with a lower depreciable asset base. \n \u2022 we have not identified any legal or political impediments which we believe will not be resolved in our favor; \nInflation\nThe operating results of the operations discussed above have been included in discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nEastern Region - Transition Period 2014 compared to Unaudited Eight Month Period 2013\nThe period-to-period change in cost of operations can be primarily attributed to the following:\nIn fiscal year 2014, we determined that assets of the CARES water treatment facility were no longer operational or were not operating within product performance parameters. As a result, we initiated a plan to abandon and shut down the operations of CARES. It was determined that the carrying value of the assets of CARES was no longer recoverable and, as a result, the carrying value of the asset group was assessed for impairment and impaired. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $7.5 million in each of fiscal year 2014 and calendar year 2014 to the asset group of CARES in the Western region.\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, and other financial information, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.\nOur general and administration expense increased $3.7 million, or 0.4% as a percentage of revenues, for fiscal year 2014 when compared to fiscal year 2013.\n \u2022 Maintenance and repair costs increased $4.8 million due to: higher facility maintenance costs associated with our Recycling segment, our hauling operations, certain landfills in our Western and Eastern regions, and the acquisition of a transfer station in the Eastern region; and higher fleet repair and maintenance costs associated with hauling operations. \nSee Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further disclosure.\n Facility, was 4.75 as of December 31, 2015. The consolidated leverage ratio is used to set pricing according to the ABL Facility agreement and there is no financial covenant associated with this ratio. A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to minimum consolidated EBITDA is as follows (in millions): \nRevenues - Transition Period 2014 compared to Unaudited Eight Month Period 2013\nOur engineers, in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and surveyors, are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills. The remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey, which is then used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography.\nWe currently include unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances. To be considered expansion airspace all of the following criteria must be met:\n \u2022 General and administration: General and administration expenses increased by $4.5 million primarily due to higher shared overhead costs and an increase in incentive compensation. \nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding $3.6 million aggregate principal amount of Finance Authority of Maine Solid Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds Series 2005R-1 (\u201cFAME Bonds 2005R-1\u201d). The FAME Bonds 2005R-1 are variable rate bonds secured by a letter of credit issued by our administrative agent bank and interest is payable semiannually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year. The FAME Bonds 2005R-1 mature on January 1, 2025. We borrowed the proceeds of the FAME Bonds 2005R-1 and 2005R-2 to pay for certain costs relating to the following: landfill development and construction; the acquisition of vehicles, containers and related equipment for solid waste collection and transportation services; improvements to existing solid waste disposal, hauling, transfer station and other facilities; other infrastructure improvements; and the acquisition of machinery and equipment for solid waste disposal operations owned and operated by us, or a related party, all located in Maine.\n \u2022 Improved operational performance in the transition period 2014 as revenues increased by $28.3 million, partially offset by higher cost of operations and general and administration costs, which increased by $27.5 million or 1.2% as a percentage of revenues. \nNew Accounting Standards\nThe indenture governing the 2019 Notes contains certain negative covenants which restrict, among other things, our ability to sell assets, make investments in joint ventures, pay dividends, repurchase stock, incur debt, grant liens and issue preferred stock. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all covenants under the indenture governing the 2019 Notes, and we do not believe that these restrictions impact our ability to meet future liquidity needs except that they may impact our ability to increase our investments in non-wholly owned entities, including the joint ventures to which we are already party.\nAs a result of the sale of our 50% membership interest in GreenFiber, we recorded a gain on sale of equity method investment of $0.8 million in eight month period 2013, which included a $0.2 million working capital adjustment to the purchase price that was finalized upon closing of the transaction in January 2014. We had initially recorded a gain on sale of equity method investment of $0.6 million in fiscal year 2014 as a result of the sale.\nOther revenues increased $12.2 million during fiscal year 2014 when compared to fiscal year 2013. Increased revenues for fiscal year 2014 was primarily the result of higher volumes within our Organics business and organic growth and the acquisition of an industrial service management business within our Customer Solutions business in fiscal year 2014.\nThe period-to-period change in general and administration expenses can be primarily attributed to the following:\nRecycling revenues\nImpairment of Investments\n \u2022 Labor and related benefit costs increased $4.9 million due to: increased overall healthcare costs and increased labor costs associated with higher collection and transfer station volumes in the Eastern region and new contracts and facilities in the Recycling segment. \nThere were no acquisitions in fiscal year 2015.\nThe $1.4 million expense from divestiture, acquisition and financing costs recorded in fiscal year 2013 is associated with the following fiscal year 2013 events: a $0.3 million write-off of costs associated with the full refinancing of our 11.0% senior second lien notes (\u201cSecond Lien Notes\u201d) in fiscal year 2013, $0.6 million of legal costs associated with the Maine Energy divestiture transaction, and $0.5 million of costs associated with the BBI acquisition.\nAll share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period. Stock-based compensation expense is based on the number of awards ultimately expected to vest and is therefore reduced for an estimate of the awards that are expected to be forfeited prior to vesting.\nIn the first step (defined as \u201cStep 1\u201d) of testing for goodwill impairment, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit, which we have determined to be our geographic operating segments, our Recycling segment and our Customer Solutions business, which is included in the Other segment, and compare the fair value with the carrying value of the net assets of each reporting unit. If the fair value is less than its carrying value, then we would perform a second step (defined as \u201cStep 2\u201d) and determine the fair value of the goodwill. In Step 2, the fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit's identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole, as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated.\nFounded in 1975 with a single truck, Casella Waste Systems, Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries and certain partially owned entities over which it has a controlling financial interest, is a regional, vertically-integrated solid waste services company. We provide resource management expertise and services to residential, commercial, municipal and industrial customers, primarily in the areas of solid waste collection and disposal, transfer, recycling and organics services. We provide integrated solid waste services in six states: Vermont, New Hampshire, New York, Massachusetts, Maine and Pennsylvania, with our headquarters located in Rutland, Vermont. We manage our solid waste operations on a geographic basis through two regional operating segments, the Eastern and Western regions, each of which provides a full range of solid waste services, and our larger-scale recycling and commodity brokerage operations through our Recycling segment. Organics services, ancillary operations, industrial services, discontinued operations, and earnings from equity method investees, as applicable, are included in our Other segment.\n \u2022 The closed landfill change component in fiscal year 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of our Worcester landfill, which stopped accepting waste in fiscal year 2013 based on the attainment of its permitted capacity. The impact of the closure was limited in fiscal year 2014 as we were granted a permit in May 2013 to accept an additional 0.2 million tons of waste. We began placing additional waste pursuant to the permit at the end of June 2013 and ceased placing tons in April 2014.  Eastern region operating loss decreased $4.2 million during fiscal year 2014 when compared to fiscal year 2013. The change in operating income is primarily attributable to the following cost changes:\nOutstanding Long-Term Debt\nThe following table provides details associated with the period-to-period change in revenues (dollars in millions) attributable to services provided:\nWe executed a purchase and sale agreement in fiscal year 2015 pursuant to which we and Altela agreed to sell certain assets of the CARES water treatment facility to a third-party. We sold these assets of CARES for purchase consideration of $3.5 million, resulting in a gain of $2.9 million in fiscal year 2015, 49% of which was attributable to Altela, the noncontrolling interest holder. As of December 31, 2015, we continued to pursue the dissolution of CARES in accordance with the CARES agreement.\n \u2022 Interest payments decreased $6.2 million in fiscal year 2014 due to the timing of payments, as well as lower interest rates as a result of the refinancing in October and November of 2012 of $180.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 11.0% Second Lien Notes. This reduction was partially offset by an increase in interest payments associated with higher average debt balances. \n \u2022 Labor and related benefit costs increased $3.7 million due to higher wages and salaries, higher incentive compensation costs, and higher equity compensation costs. \nWe manage our solid waste operations, which include a full range of solid waste services, on a geographic basis through two regional operating segments, which we designate as the Eastern and Western regions. Revenues in our Eastern and Western regions consist primarily of fees charged to customers for solid waste collection and disposal, landfill, landfill gas-to-energy, transfer and recycling services. We derive a substantial portion of our collection revenues from commercial, industrial and municipal services that are generally performed under service agreements or pursuant to contracts with municipalities. The majority of our residential collection services are performed on a subscription basis with individual households. Landfill and transfer customers are charged a tipping fee on a per ton basis for disposing of their solid waste at our disposal facilities and transfer stations. We also generate and sell electricity at certain of our landfill facilities. In addition, revenues from our Recycling segment consist of revenues derived from municipalities and customers in the form of processing fees, tipping fees and commodity sales. Organics services, ancillary operations, major account and industrial services, discontinued operations, and earnings from equity method investees, as applicable, are included in our Other segment. Our revenues are shown net of inter-company eliminations.\n Eastern Region\nOther - Transition Period 2014 compared to Unaudited Eight Month Period 2013\nOther revenues decreased $0.1 million during fiscal year 2015 when compared to calendar year 2014 primarily due to volume declines in our Organics business associated with lower commodity volumes and a decline in our floating rate fuel and oil recovery fee in response to lower diesel fuel index prices on which the surcharge is based, and a decline in transportation volumes. This was partially offset by organic business growth within our Customer Solutions business.\nWe estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity (see landfill development costs discussed within the \u201cProperty, Plant and Equipment\u201d accounting policy more fully discussed in Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). The projection of these landfill costs is dependent, in part, on future events. The remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized, net of accumulated airspace amortization, and projections of future purchase and development costs including capitalized interest. The interest capitalization rate is based on our weighted average interest rate incurred on borrowings outstanding during the period.\nThe following table provides details associated with the period-to-period change in revenues (dollars in millions) attributable to services provided:\n \u2022 Payments related to investments. During eight month period 2013, we made investments in unconsolidated entities totaling $2.0 million, whereas we made no payments related to investments in transition period 2014. \nOther\n Based on the seasonality of our business, operating results in the late fall, winter and early spring months are generally lower than the remainder of our fiscal year. Given the cash flow impact that this seasonality, the capital intensive nature of our business and the timing of debt payments has on our business, we typically incur higher debt borrowings from the ABL Facility in order to meet our liquidity needs during these times. Consequently, our availability and performance against our financial covenants tighten during these times as well.\nThe cost estimates for final capping, closure and post-closure activities at landfills for which we have responsibility are estimated based on our interpretations of current requirements and proposed or anticipated regulatory changes. We also estimate additional costs based on the amount a third-party would charge us to perform such activities even when we expect to perform these activities internally. We estimate the airspace to be consumed related to each final capping event and the timing of construction related to each final capping event and of closure and post-closure activities. Because landfill final capping, closure and post-closure obligations are measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques, changes in the estimated timing of construction of future landfill final capping and closure and post-closure activities would have an effect on these liabilities, related assets and results of operations.\nThe period-to-period change in cost of operations can be primarily attributed to the following:\n \u2022 The closed landfill change component in transition period 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of our Worcester landfill, which ceased operations in April 2014 in accordance with its permit.  Organics revenues\nWe monitor and assess the carrying value of our investments throughout the year for potential impairment and write them down to their fair value when other-than-temporary declines exist. Fair value is generally based on (i) other third-party investors' recent transactions in the securities; (ii) other information available regarding the current market for similar assets and/or (iii) a market or income approach, as deemed appropriate.\nIt is possible that actual results, including the amount of costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and post-closure activities, our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To the extent that such estimates or related assumptions prove to be significantly different than actual results, lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates, higher final capping, closure or post-closure rates, or higher expenses. Higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs. Most significantly, if it is determined that the expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of the landfill asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment. If it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion permit has become remote, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately.\n \u2022 Direct operational costs increased $5.6 million due to: higher costs at our landfills (including increases in leachate treatment costs due to the timing of cell development, landfill gas treatment costs and maintenance costs); higher equipment rental costs associated with an increase in fleet and landfill equipment rentals; an increase in host and royalty fees and higher depletion of landfill operating lease obligations due to increased volumes received at our landfills; and an increase in vehicle insurance costs. \n \u2022 Cost of operations: Cost of operations increased by $9.5 million, resulting in margin erosion as costs increased at a greater rate than revenues. The change was primarily due to: an increase in third-party direct costs associated with higher collection and disposal volumes from new municipal contracts, organic customer growth and the acquisition of a transfer station; and an increase in other operational costs, including labor (which is driven by higher collection and transfer volumes), healthcare, depletion of landfill operating lease obligations at Southbridge, and maintenance costs associated with hauling operations and certain of our landfills. These costs were partially offset by a decrease in fleet and landfill equipment rentals, as well as host community fees and royalties; lower accretion expense related to accrued final capping, closure and post-closure costs associated with our Worcester landfill; and lower leachate treatment costs. \nResults of Operations\nWe recognized a $0.4 million loss on disposal of discontinued operations in fiscal year 2014 associated with the BioFuels disposition.\n (3) Contractual cash obligations do not include accounts payable or accrued liabilities, which will be paid in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. \nMaine Energy. In fiscal year 2013, we executed a purchase and sale agreement with the City of Biddeford, Maine, pursuant to which we agreed to sell the real property of Maine Energy to the City of Biddeford. We agreed to sell Maine Energy for an undiscounted purchase consideration of $6.7 million, which is being paid to us in installments over twenty-one years. Later in fiscal year 2013, we closed the transaction, ceased operations of the Maine Energy facility, and initiated the decommissioning, demolition and site remediation process in accordance with the provisions of the agreement. In fiscal year 2015, we completed the demolition process and site remediation under the auspices and in accordance with work plans approved by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection and the EPA. Based on the total incurred costs to fulfill our obligation under the agreement, we reversed a reserve of $1.1 million of excess costs to complete the divestiture in fiscal year 2015.\n \u2022 Professional fees decreased $1.3 million due to lower legal costs associated with fewer ongoing legal proceedings and lower consulting costs. \n Depreciation and Amortization - Fiscal Year 2015 compared to Unaudited Calendar Year 2014\nSenior Credit Facility. In fiscal year 2015, we recorded a charge of $0.5 million as a loss on debt extinguishment related to the write-off of deferred financing costs in connection with changes to the borrowing capacity from the Senior Credit Facility to the ABL Facility. The remaining unamortized deferred financing costs of the Senior Credit Facility, along with fees paid to the creditor and third-party costs incurred for the ABL Facility, are to be amortized over the term of the ABL Facility.\n \u2022 Cost of operations: Cost of operations increased by $12.0 million primarily due to: an increase in third-party direct costs related to increased collection and transfer station volumes, a shift in volumes to external haulers, and an increase in state, local and other disposal fees associated with higher taxes due to a shift in mix type; an increase in direct operational costs associated with higher labor, equipment rentals and leases, depletion of landfill operating lease obligations and host community fees; and an increase in vehicle and facility maintenance costs. \n \u2022 The acquisitions and divestitures change component in fiscal year 2015 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of increased revenues from the acquisition of two solid waste hauling operations in September and October 2014, partially offset by decreased revenues associated primarily with an asset exchange in December 2014 and the divestiture of a business in May 2015. \n \u2022 The closed landfill change component in fiscal year 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of our Worcester landfill, which stopped accepting waste and ceased operations in April 2014 in accordance with its permit. \n \u2022 an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; \nWe account for income tax uncertainties according to guidance on the recognition, de-recognition and measurement of potential tax benefits associated with tax positions. We recognize interest and penalties relating to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense.\nIncome (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, net\nOther operating income increased by $0.5 million during fiscal year 2015 when compared to calendar year 2014 based on the operating performance of our Customer Solutions business. Profitability in the Customer Solutions business improved as we continued to gain leverage on higher revenues and lower general and administration costs.\n (2) As of December 31, 2015, borrowing availability was calculated as a borrowing base of $148.5 million, less revolver borrowings of $57.5 million, less outstanding irrevocable letters of credit totaling $26.9 million, at which date no amount had been drawn.  As of December 31, 2015, our additional financial ratio covenants, as defined in the ABL Facility agreement (if they would have been applicable) were as follows:\n \u2022 The acquisitions and divestitures change component in transition period 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of the acquisition of two solid waste hauling operations, one in September 2013 and another in October 2014, and a transfer station in November 2013.  Closed landfill.\nThe period-to-period changes in cost of operations can be primarily attributed to the following:\n \u2022 The increase in revenues for transition period 2014 is the result of $7.9 million from higher volumes and $1.0 million from the acquisition of an industrial service management business in September 2013.  Recycling revenues\nRecycling operating loss for fiscal year 2014 increased by $1.7 million when compared to fiscal year 2013 due to extended inclement weather that resulted in lower operating productivity and reduced processing throughput, along with unplanned maintenance activities.\n \u2022 Maintenance costs increased $4.8 million due to: higher vehicle maintenance costs associated with the integration of the BBI vehicle fleet; higher facility costs associated with unplanned maintenance activities within the Recycling segment; and higher container repair costs. \nRecycling operating loss decreased by $0.8 million during transition period 2014 when compared to eight month period 2013 due to increased revenues and improved operating efficiencies, partially eroded by higher commodity purchased material costs, higher labor and healthcare costs, and increased facility maintenance activities.\n\nSee Note 11, Stockholders Deficit to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further disclosure.\nThe following table provides details associated with the period-to-period change in revenues (dollars in millions) attributable to services provided:\nCash Flow Activity - Transition Period 2014 compared to Unaudited Eight Month Period 2013\n \u2022 The volume change component in fiscal year 2015 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $16.8 million from higher disposal volumes (of which $8.4 million relates to higher landfill volumes, $4.1 million relates to higher transfer station volumes associated with two new transfer station contracts and organic growth, and $4.3 million relates to transportation) and $1.4 million from higher collection volumes, partially offset by $2.0 million from lower processing volumes (mainly water treatment and recycling processing).  Commodity price and volume.\nOur business is primarily located in the northeastern United States. Therefore, our business, financial condition and results of operations are susceptible to downturns in the general economy in this geographic region and other factors affecting the region, such as state regulations and severe weather conditions. We are unable to forecast or determine the timing and/or the future impact of a sustained economic slowdown.\nThere were no divestitures in transition period 2014.\nSegment Reporting\nAccounts Receivable - Trade, Net of Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nSale of Business. In fiscal year 2015, we divested a business, which included the sale of certain assets associated with various waste collection routes in the Western region, for total consideration of $0.9 million, resulting in a gain of $0.6 million.\nSecond Lien Notes. In fiscal year 2013, we recorded a charge of $15.6 million as a loss on debt extinguishment related to the full refinancing of our Second Lien Notes. The loss on debt extinguishment consisted of a $2.8 million non-cash write off of deferred financing costs, a $2.1 million non-cash write off of the unamortized original issue discount and a $10.7 million charge associated with the early tender premium and tender fees associated with the redemption of the Second Lien Notes.\nBioFuels. As a part of the disposition of BioFuels, we agreed to complete certain site improvements that were completed in transition period 2014. As a result, we recorded a $0.6 million gain in each of transition period 2014 and calendar year 2014 associated with reversing the excess remaining reserves not needed to complete the site improvements.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \u2022 Fiscal year 2015 revenues decreased as the result of lower volumes and a decline in our floating rate fuel and oil recovery fee in response to lower diesel fuel index prices on which the surcharge is based.  Customer solutions revenues\n \u2022 Debt activity. We had both an increase in debt borrowings, $26.6 million (associated with the issuance of the New York and New Hampshire Bonds, along with higher capital expenditures), and debt payments, $20.6 million (associated with the pay down of our Senior Credit Facility using the net proceeds from the issuance of New York Bonds and New Hampshire Bonds). \n If the borrowing availability is less than a minimum availability threshold determined in accordance with the ABL Facility agreement, we are then subject to additional financial ratio covenants. As of December 31, 2015, our borrowing availability was greater than the minimum availability threshold as follows (in millions):\nEnvironmental Remediation Charge\nGoodwill and Other Intangibles\nWe may assess whether a goodwill impairment exists using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment. If we perform a qualitative assessment, it involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If based on this qualitative assessment we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we will not perform a quantitative assessment. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative assessment, or two-step impairment test, to determine whether goodwill impairment exists at the reporting unit.\nTo determine the fair value of each of our reporting units as a whole we use discounted cash flow analyses, which require significant assumptions and estimates about the future operations of each reporting unit. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the determination of appropriate discount rates, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates. The cash flows employed in our discounted cash flow analyses are based on financial forecasts developed internally by management. Our discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of our risk adjusted discount rate, applicable for each reporting unit. In assessing the reasonableness of our determined fair values of our reporting units, we evaluate our results against our current market capitalization\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions\n \u2022 senior management has approved the project.  For unpermitted airspace to be included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, the expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above. These criteria are evaluated annually by our engineers, accountants, lawyers, managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits. Once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards, an airspace utilization factor (\u201cAUF\u201d) is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons. The AUF is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys. When we include the expansion airspace in our calculation of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, we include the projected costs for development, as well as the projected asset retirement costs related to final capping, closure and post-closure of the expansion airspace in the amortization basis of the landfill.\n \u2022 The commodity price and volume change component in fiscal year 2014 total solid waste revenues growth remained consistent year over year with increased revenues from higher commodity volumes slightly eclipsing decreased revenues from unfavorable pricing.  Acquisitions and divestitures.\nInterest Expense, net - Fiscal Year 2015 compared to Unaudited Calendar Year 2014\nRevenues - Fiscal Year 2014 compared to Fiscal Year 2013\n \u2022 Payment of financing costs. We made lower payments of financing costs of $4.2 million in fiscal year 2014 due primarily to the offering of $125.0 million in additional 2019 Notes in fiscal year 2013. \nRecycling - Fiscal Year 2014 compared to Fiscal Year 2013\nRecycling operating loss increased by $0.7 million during fiscal year 2015 when compared to calendar year 2014 as operating results were negatively impacted by unfavorable commodity prices, higher hauling and labor costs, increased facility maintenance activities and higher shared overhead costs, partially offset by higher processing fees charged to third-party and intercompany customers.\n \u2022 a more likely than not expectation that a segment or a significant portion thereof will be sold; or \n \u2022 The volume change component in transition period 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $7.0 million from higher disposal volumes (of which $4.4 million relates to higher landfill volumes, $2.2 million relates to higher transfer station volumes associated with two new transfer station contracts, and $0.4 million relates to higher transportation volumes), partially offset by $1.3 million from lower collection volumes and $0.3 million from lower processing volumes.  Commodity price and volume.\n \u2022 The increase in revenues for fiscal year 2014 is the result of $2.6 million from higher volumes and $5.3 million from the acquisition of an industrial service management business. \nAcquisitions\nThe preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, as applicable, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of their evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances. Our significant accounting policies are more fully discussed in Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nClosure and post-closure costs represent future estimated costs related to monitoring and maintenance of a solid waste landfill after a landfill facility ceases to accept waste and closes. We estimate, based on input from our engineers, lawyers, accounting personnel and consultants, our future cost requirements for closure and post-closure monitoring and maintenance based on our interpretation of the technical standards of the Subtitle D regulations and the air emissions standards under the Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended, as they are being applied on a state-by-state basis. Closure and post-closure accruals for the cost of monitoring and maintenance include site inspection, groundwater monitoring, leachate management, methane gas control and recovery, and operation and maintenance costs to be incurred for a period which is generally for a term of 30 years after final closure of a landfill. In determining estimated future closure and post-closure costs, we consider costs associated with permitted and permittable airspace.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding $16.0 million aggregate principal amount Vermont Economic Development Authority Solid Waste Disposal Long-Term Revenue Bonds Series 2013 (\u201cVermont Bonds\u201d). The Vermont Bonds, which are unsecured and guaranteed jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally by all of our significant wholly-owned subsidiaries, accrue interest at 4.75% per annum through April 1, 2018, at which time they may be converted from a fixed rate to a variable rate, and interest is payable semiannually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The Vermont Bonds mature on April 1, 2036. We borrowed the proceeds of the Vermont Bonds to repay borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility for qualifying property, plant and equipment assets purchased in the state of Vermont.\nWe acquired various solid waste hauling operations during fiscal year 2013, including the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of BBI in the Eastern region, for total consideration of $27.9 million in cash and approximately 0.6 million shares of our Class A common stock, valued at an aggregate of $2.7 million. We recorded an additional $5.1 million to goodwill for the increased deferred tax liability related to the BBI acquisition based on the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amount recognized for income tax purposes. See Note 14, Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. The acquisition of BBI, a provider of solid waste collection, transfer and liquid waste services in New Hampshire and Maine, provided us the opportunity to internalize additional waste and recyclables and to consolidate operations, routes and transportation within the Eastern region.\n \u2022 The volume change component in transition period 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $10.6 million from disposal volume increases (of which $6.4 million relates to higher transfer station volumes associated with a mix shift from landfills to transfer stations and four new transfer station contracts, $3.3 million relates to landfills and $0.9 million relates to transportation) and $1.1 million from collection volume increases.  Commodity price and volume.\n Solid waste revenues\nContingent Liabilities\nThe following is a summary of our operating cash flows (in millions) for transition period 2014 and eight month period 2013:\nVermont Bonds\nIncome Taxes\nThe following is a summary of our operating cash flows (in millions) for fiscal year 2014 and fiscal year 2013:\nThe most significant items affecting the change in our financing cash flows are summarized below:\n \u2022 The price change component in fiscal year 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $2.3 million from favorable collection pricing and $0.1 million from favorable disposal pricing related primarily to transfer stations.  Volume.\n \u2022 Investments in unconsolidated entities. During fiscal year 2014, we made investments in unconsolidated entities totaling $2.1 million compared to $3.2 million in fiscal year 2013. \n \u2022 The volume change component in fiscal year 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $15.1 million from disposal volume increases (of which $7.3 million relates to landfills, $5.3 million relates to transfer stations and $2.5 million relates to transportation), $3.1 million from collection volume increases and $0.8 million from processing volume increases. \n \u2022 Other: Other charges impacting operating income included a $1.0 million environmental remediation charge recorded in transition period 2014 and a $0.4 million environmental remediation charge recorded in eight month period 2013 associated with the environmental remediation at Southbridge. \nBioFuels. In fiscal year 2013, we initiated a plan to dispose of BioFuels and as a result, the assets associated with BioFuels were classified as held-for-sale and the results of operations were recorded as income from discontinued operations. Assets of the disposal group previously classified as held-for-sale, and subsequently included in discontinued operations, included certain inventory along with plant and equipment. In fiscal year 2014, we executed a purchase and sale agreement with ReEnergy Lewiston LLC (\u201cReEnergy\u201d), pursuant to which we agreed to sell certain assets of BioFuels, which was located in our Eastern region, to ReEnergy. We agreed to sell the BioFuels assets for undiscounted purchase consideration of $2.0 million, which was to be paid to us in equal quarterly installments over five years commencing November 1, 2013, subject to the terms of the purchase and sale agreement. The related note receivable was paid in full by ReEnergy in transition period 2014. We recognized a $0.4 million loss on disposal of discontinued operations in fiscal year 2014 associated with the disposition. As a part of the divestiture, we agreed to complete certain site improvements at Biofuels, which were completed in transition period 2014. As a result, we recorded a $0.6 million gain in transition period 2014 associated with reversing the excess remaining reserves not needed to complete the site improvements.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding $25.0 million aggregate principal amount of New York Bonds. The New York Bonds, which are unsecured and guaranteed jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally by all of our significant wholly-owned subsidiaries, accrue interest at 3.75% per annum through December 1, 2019, at which time they may be converted from a fixed rate to a variable rate, and interest is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year. An additional $15.0 million aggregate principal amount of New York Bonds may be offered under the same indenture in the future. The New York Bonds mature on December 1, 2044.\n \u2022 Other: Other charges impacting operating loss in fiscal year 2014 include: a $1.4 million write off of deferred costs in fiscal year 2014 associated with a gas pipeline development project no longer deemed to be viable; a $0.4 million environmental remediation charge recorded in fiscal year 2014 associated with the remediation of Southbridge; severance costs associated primarily with realignment and the streamlining of functions to improve our cost structure and the divestiture of Maine Energy in the third quarter of fiscal year 2013; legal costs associated with the Maine Energy divestiture transaction; and costs associated directly with the BBI acquisition. \nThe ABL Facility consists of a revolving credit facility with loans thereunder being available up to an aggregate principal amount of $190.0 million, subject to availability under a borrowing base formula as defined in the ABL Facility agreement. We have the right to request, at our discretion, an increase in the amount of loans under the ABL facility by an aggregate amount of $100.0 million, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the ABL Facility agreement. Interest accrues at LIBOR plus between 1.75% and 2.50%, subject to the terms of the ABL Facility agreement and is set at LIBOR plus 2.25% as of December 31, 2015. The ABL Facility matures on February 26, 2020. If we fail to refinance the 2019 Notes on or before November 16, 2018, the maturity date of the ABL Facility will be November 16, 2018. The ABL Facility is guaranteed jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally by all of our significant wholly-owned subsidiaries and is collateralized by certain qualified accounts receivable-trade, inventory and property, plant and equipment.\n \u2022 Improved cash flow impact associated with the changes in our assets and liabilities, net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures, which are affected by both cost changes and the timing of payments. This improvement is primarily due to the favorable impact associated with the change in accounts payable based on the timing of payments. This was partially offset by the unfavorable impact associated with the change in accrued expenses and other liabilities (associated primarily with the amount and timing of capping, closure and post closure payments and the timing of accrued interest payments) and the unfavorable impact associated with the change in prepaid expenses, inventories and other assets. \nFuel and oil recovery fee.\nContractual Obligations\n \u2022 General and administration: General and administration expenses increased $0.9 million primarily due to: an increase in bad debt expense in transition period 2014 associated with increased customer growth and bad debt recoveries in eight month period 2013; an increase in incentive compensation costs; and a loss accrued for a potential legal settlement with MADEP. See discussion in Part I, Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nEastern region operating income increased $9.0 million during fiscal year 2015 when compared to calendar year 2014. This improvement is primarily attributable to revenue growth outlined above and the following cost changes:\nThe following table summarizes our revenues and operating expenses (in millions) for the following periods:\n \u2022 Payments of financing costs. We had a $2.2 million increase in deferred financing cost payments related to the issuance of the New York Bonds, the issuance of $11.0 million in aggregate principal amount of tax-exempt Solid Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds Series 2013 issued by the Business Finance Authority of the State of New Hampshire (\u201cNew Hampshire Bonds\u201d), and the refinancing of our Senior Credit Facility. \nExpansion Airspace\nIn each of fiscal year 2014 and calendar year 2014, we recovered a portion of the purchase price holdback amount we had previously paid and were relieved of any potential contingent consideration obligation associated with the acquisition of an industrial service management business earlier in fiscal year 2014. As a result, we recorded a $1.1 million gain on settlement of acquisition related contingent consideration in each of fiscal year 2014 and calendar year 2014.\n (1) Minimum consolidated EBITDA is based on operating results for the twelve months preceding the measurement date, December 31, 2015. Based on the minimum consolidated EBITDA, our consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the ABL \nOperating Expenses\n The most significant items affecting the change in our operating cash flows are summarized below:\n \u2022 Improved operational performance in fiscal year 2015 as revenues increased by $20.6 million, whereas cost of operations and general and administration costs increased only $11.5 million, a decrease of 1.1% as a percentage of revenues. \n \u2022 The volume change component in fiscal year 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $5.6 million from higher disposal volumes (of which $3.0 million relates to landfill volumes, $1.6 million relates to transfer station volumes and $0.9 million relates to transportation volumes), $0.5 million from higher processing volumes and $0.2 million from higher collection volumes. \nCompany Overview\n \u2022 Cash interest payments decreased $0.3 million from $18.7 million for eight month period 2013 to $18.4 million for transition period 2014 primarily due to the timing of payments associated with changes to our capitalization structure.  Net cash used in investing activities. Cash flows used in investing activities increased by $13.9 million for transition period 2014 when compared to eight month period 2013.\n The most significant items affecting the change in our operating cash flows are summarized below:\nOther - Fiscal Year 2015 compared to Unaudited Calendar Year 2014\nSenior Subordinated Notes. In fiscal year 2015, we repurchased and permanently retired $14.7 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes at a weighted average repurchase price of $101.0 in order to maximize interest savings by paying down our most expensive debt. As a result of the repurchases, we recorded a charge of $0.5 million in fiscal year 2015 as a loss on debt extinguishment primarily related to the non-cash write off of deferred financing costs and unamortized original issue discount in proportion with the settlement amount.\n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization: Depreciation and amortization costs remained flat primarily due to lower landfill amortization associated with our Worcester landfill, which no longer accepted waste in transition period 2014, offset by an increase in other amortization associated with acquired intangible assets. \nAs of December 31, 2015, we owned 17.0% and 16.2% of the outstanding common stock of AGreen Energy LLC (\u201cAGreen\u201d) and BGreen Energy LLC (\u201cBGreen\u201d), respectively. In fiscal year 2015, AGreen and BGreen, both of which we account for as cost method investments, entered into agreements that resulted in the contribution and sale of certain assets and liabilities of AGreen and BGreen to a limited liability company in exchange for partial ownership interests in a parent of that limited liability company. As a result of the transactions, we performed an analysis to determine whether an other-than-temporary impairment in the carrying value of our cost method investments had occurred. Based on the analysis performed, which measured the fair value of our cost method investments using an in-exchange valuation premise under the market approach that utilized the estimated purchase consideration received, we recorded an other-than-temporary investment impairment charge of $0.3 million in fiscal year 2015.\n \u2022 The volume change component in fiscal year 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $7.9 million from higher disposal volumes (of which $7.2 million relates to higher landfill volumes and $3.6 million relates to higher transfer station volumes, partially offset by $2.9 million in volumes that were not retained after the divestiture of Maine Energy), $2.8 million from higher collection volumes and $0.3 million from higher processing volumes.  Commodity price and volume.\nGeneral and Administration\nFuel and oil recovery fee.\nNet cash provided by (used in) discontinued operations. Cash flows from discontinued operations increased $1.9 million during transition period 2014 when compared to eight month period 2013 due to repayment in full of the remainder of the $2.0 million note receivable associated with the business disposition of BioFuels.\nMaine Energy. In fiscal year 2013, we executed a purchase and sale agreement with the City of Biddeford, Maine, pursuant to which we agreed to sell the real property of Maine Energy to the City of Biddeford. We agreed to sell Maine Energy for an undiscounted purchase consideration of $6.7 million, which is being paid to us in installments over twenty-one years. Later in fiscal year 2013, we closed the transaction, ceased operations of the Maine Energy facility, and initiated the decommissioning, demolition and site remediation process in accordance with the provisions of the agreement. In fiscal year 2015, we completed the demolition process and site remediation under the auspices and in accordance with work plans approved by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection and the EPA. Based on the total incurred costs to fulfill our obligation under the agreement, we reversed a reserve of $1.1 million of excess costs to complete the divestiture in fiscal year 2015.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Entities\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment\n Revenues\n \u2022 Third-party direct costs increased $11.8 million due to: organic and acquisition growth in our Customer Solutions business, which has a higher inherent direct cost structure; higher collection and disposal volumes from organic customer growth and the acquisition of a transfer station in the Eastern region; higher volumes in our Organics business; and higher disposal volumes associated with four new transfer station contracts and the acquisition of various hauling operations in the Western region. \n \u2022 Improved cash flow impact associated with the changes in our assets and liabilities, net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures, which are affected by both cost changes and the timing of payments. The improvement in fiscal year 2015 was the result of the favorable cash flow impacts associated with prepaid expenses, inventories and other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities due to lower final capping, closure and post-closure payments, partially offset by the unfavorable cash flow impacts associated with accounts payable and accounts receivable.  Net cash used in investing activities. Cash flows used in investing activities decreased by $23.0 million during fiscal year 2015 when compared to calendar year 2014.\n \u2022 Landfill amortization expense increased due to: an increase in landfill volumes at our Eastern region landfills and at certain of our landfills within the Western region; and an amortization rate adjustment as a result of updating cost estimates and other assumptions associated with the annual year-end review of our landfills.  Depreciation and Amortization - Transition Period 2014 compared to Unaudited Eight Month Period 2013\nFinal Landfill Capping, Closure and Post-Closure Costs\nDepreciation and amortization includes: (i) depreciation of property and equipment, including assets recorded for capital leases, on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets; (ii) amortization of landfill costs (including those costs incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development and construction, along with asset retirement costs arising from closure and post-closure obligations) on a units-of-consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the total estimated remaining capacity of a site, which includes both permitted capacity and unpermitted expansion capacity that meets our criteria for amortization purposes; (iii) amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a units-of-consumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event and (iv) amortization of intangible assets with a definite life, using either an economic benefit provided approach or a straight-line basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements.\n \u2022 a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group; \n \u2022 The closed landfill change component in transition period 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of our Worcester landfill, which ceased operations in April 2014 in accordance with its permit.  Eastern region operating income decreased $0.5 million during transition period 2014 when compared to eight month period 2013. The change in operating income is primarily attributable to the following cost changes:\n \u2022 The acquisitions and divestitures change component in fiscal year 2015 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of increased revenues from the acquisition of a solid waste hauling operation in October 2014.  Closed landfill.\nThe following table provides details associated with the period-to-period change in revenues (dollars in millions) attributable to services provided:\nThe ABL Facility agreement requires us to maintain minimum consolidated EBITDA for the twelve months preceding the measurement date measured at the end of each fiscal quarter. Minimum consolidated EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that should not be considered an alternative to any measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the minimum consolidated EBITDA financial covenant contained in the ABL Facility agreement as follows (in millions):\nThe following table summarizes our cost of operations, general and administration expenses and depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of revenues for the following periods:\nDivestiture Transactions\nExpense from Divestiture, Acquisition and Financing Costs\nNet cash used in discontinued operations. Cash flows used in discontinued operations decreased $2.2 million for fiscal year 2014 when compared to fiscal year 2013. These fluctuations in net cash flows from discontinued operations are the result of the business disposition of BioFuels in exchange for a $2.0 million note receivable, which was to be paid to us in equal quarterly installments commencing November 1, 2013.\n \u2022 The price change component in fiscal year 2015 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $3.1 million from favorable collection pricing and $1.1 million from favorable disposal pricing related to landfills and transfer stations. \nLandfill Accounting\nCommodity price and volume.\nWestern region operating income increased $11.0 million during fiscal year 2015 when compared to the calendar year 2014. This improvement is primarily attributable to revenue growth outlined above and the following cost changes:\nCARES and Related Transaction. We executed a purchase and sale agreement in fiscal year 2015 pursuant to which we and Altela agreed to sell certain assets of the CARES water treatment facility to a third-party. We sold these assets of CARES for purchase consideration of $3.5 million, resulting in a gain of $2.9 million in fiscal year 2015, 49% of which was attributable to Altela, the noncontrolling interest holder. As of December 31, 2015, we continued to pursue the dissolution of CARES in accordance with the CARES agreement.\n \u2022 we control the land on which the expansion is sought; \nVolume.\nCost of Operations - Fiscal Year 2015 compared to Unaudited Calendar Year 2014\n \u2022 The increase in revenues for fiscal year 2014 is primarily the result of higher commodity volumes and the acquisition of the remaining 50% membership interest of Tompkins. \nWe have recorded environmental remediation liabilities representing our estimate of the most likely outcome of the matters for which we have determined that a liability is probable. These liabilities include potentially responsible party investigations, settlements, certain legal and consultant fees, as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up, such as materials and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy. We provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We estimate costs required to remediate sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred based on site-specific facts and circumstances. Estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are developed using third-party environmental engineers or other service providers. Where we believe that both the amount of a particular environmental remediation liability and timing of payments are reliably determinable, we inflate the cost in current dollars until the expected time of payment and discount the cost to present value.\nSee Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further disclosure.\nOur cost of operations increased $5.4 million, decreasing 1.7% as a percentage of revenues, for fiscal year 2015 when compared to calendar year 2014.\n \u2022 The volume change component in transition period 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $3.1 million from higher disposal volumes (which includes a mix shift in volumes from landfills to transfer stations), $2.5 million from higher collection volumes and $0.2 million from higher processing volumes.  Commodity price and volume.\n \u2022 a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset or asset group, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; \nWe annually assess goodwill impairment at the end of our fiscal year or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. Historically, we have performed our annual goodwill impairment test using our fiscal year-end, or April 30th, as the measurement date. Effective with the change in our fiscal year-end from April 30th to December 31st, we have voluntarily changed our goodwill impairment measurement date from April 30th to December 31st to coincide with the change in our fiscal year-end. The voluntary change in our goodwill impairment measurement date was applied prospectively as it represents the modification of an existing principle based on new facts and circumstances.\n \u2022 General and administration: General and administration costs remained flat due to a higher than normal bad debt expense in eight month period 2013 due to collectability issues associated with two disposal customers being offset by higher healthcare costs and increased incentive compensation costs. \nThe most significant items affecting the change in our investing cash flows are summarized below:\nThe most significant items affecting the change in our investing cash flows are summarized below:\nAcquisitions and divestitures.\nIn transition period 2014, we completed a financing transaction involving the issuance of $25.0 million in aggregate principal amount of New York Bonds. We borrowed the proceeds of the New York Bonds to repay borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility for qualifying property, plant and equipment assets purchased in the state of New York.\n \u2022 Third-party direct costs increased $17.4 million due to: organic and acquisition growth in our Customer Solutions business; higher volumes in our Organics business; higher collection and disposal volumes from organic customer growth and the acquisition of BBI and other tuck-in acquisitions; and an increase in state, local and other disposal fees associated with higher disposal volumes and higher taxes due to a shift in waste mix type. \n \u2022 Capital expenditures. Lower capital expenditures of $9.1 million in fiscal year 2014 related primarily to the timing of landfill development projects and a decrease in spending related to facilities.  Net cash provided by financing activities. Cash flows provided by financing activities decreased $35.9 million for fiscal year 2014 when compared to fiscal year 2013.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding $15.0 million aggregate principal amount of FAME Bonds 2015. The FAME Bonds 2015, which are unsecured and guaranteed jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally by all of our significant wholly-owned subsidiaries, accrue interest at 5.125% per annum through August 1, 2025, at which time they may be converted from a fixed to a variable rate, and interest is payable semiannually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year. An additional $15.0 million aggregate principal amount of FAME Bonds 2015 may be offered under the same indenture in the future. The FAME Bonds 2015 mature on August 1, 2035.\n \u2022 Depreciation expense increased due to: changes in our depreciable asset base as a result of the timing of various capital expenditures, including fleet upgrades and repairs and container purchases, made late in calendar year 2014, partially offset by the impact of various divestitures and asset sales, and the impairment of the asset group of CARES. \nOur cost of operations increased $31.6 million, or 0.4% as a percentage of revenues, for fiscal years 2014 when compared to fiscal year 2013.\n \u2022 Cost of operations: Cost of operations increased by $2.0 million due to: higher disposal volumes associated with organic customer growth, two new transfer station contracts and the acquisition of a solid waste hauling operation; higher equipment rental costs; higher third-party landfill disposal costs; higher operating and leachate disposal costs at certain landfills; and higher fleet maintenance costs. Increased costs were partially offset by lower diesel fuel prices, lower depletion of landfill operating lease obligations at a landfill due to a decrease in tons and a favorable rate impact associated with the annual year-end review of our landfills, lower purchased material costs and lower benefit costs. \nLoss on Derivative Instruments\n \u2022 a significant adverse change in legal status or in the business climate; \nAcquisitions and divestitures.\nIn connection with this transaction, we also sold certain of our equipment and real estate to the same third-party for total consideration of $1.1 million, resulting in a gain of $0.9 million in fiscal year 2015.\nRecycling - Transition Period 2014 compared to Unaudited Eight Month Period 2013\n \u2022 Capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were $21.6 million higher primarily due to organic business growth (including increased spending on our fleet), the installation of a gas treatment system at Juniper Ridge, various landfill development costs, and other capital investments associated with certain new contracts and a new MRF in Lewiston, Maine. \n\nWe continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows, our liquidity and our capital requirements in order to properly manage our cash needs based on the capital intensive nature of our business. Our capital requirements include fixed asset purchases (including capital expenditures for vehicles), debt servicing, landfill development and cell construction, landfill site and cell closure, as well as acquisitions. We generally meet our liquidity needs from operating cash flows and borrowings from a revolving credit facility.\n \u2022 all technical siting criteria have been met or a variance has been obtained or is reasonably expected to be obtained; \nWe use estimates to determine our provision for income taxes and related assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances have been established for the possibility that tax benefits may not be realized for certain deferred tax assets. Deferred income taxes are recognized based on the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, calculated using currently enacted tax rates. We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making this determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes.\n \u2022 The acquisitions and divestitures change component in fiscal year 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $14.4 million from the acquisition of BBI, partially offset by $7.4 million from the divestiture of Maine Energy.  Closed landfill.\n \u2022 Fuel costs decreased $0.6 million primarily due to lower diesel fuel prices in the marketplace.  Cost of Operations - Fiscal Year 2014 compared to Fiscal Year 2013\nGreenFiber. In fiscal year 2014, we and LP executed a purchase and sale agreement with a limited liability company formed by Tenex Capital Partners, L.P., pursuant to which we and LP agreed to sell our membership interests in GreenFiber for total cash consideration of $18.0 million plus an expected working capital true-up less any indebtedness and other unpaid transaction costs of GreenFiber as of the closing date. The transaction was completed for $19.2 million in gross cash proceeds, including a $1.2 million working capital adjustment. After netting indebtedness of GreenFiber and transaction costs, our 50% of the net cash proceeds amounted to $3.4 million. After considering the $0.6 million impact of our unrealized losses relating to derivative instruments in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our investment in GreenFiber, we recorded a gain on sale of equity method investment of $0.6 million in fiscal year 2014. We had previously accounted for our 50% membership interest in GreenFiber using the equity method of accounting.\n \u2022 Other amortization expense increased $1.2 million associated with an increase in our amortizable intangible assets due to acquisitions made in fiscal year 2014 and the acquisition of BBI in December 2012. \nRecycling - Fiscal Year 2015 compared to Unaudited Calendar Year 2014\nPrice.\nThe most significant items affecting the change in our financing cash flows are summarized below:\nLoss from Equity Method Investment and Gain on Sale of Equity Method Investment\nInterest Expense, net - Fiscal Year 2014 compared to Fiscal Year 2013\nIn fiscal 2013, we recorded a charge of $3.7 million for severance costs associated primarily with the realignment of our operations in order to streamline functions and improve our cost structure, the closure of Maine Energy and a reorganization of senior management. Through the realignment of our operations we improved certain aspects of the sales function to facilitate customer service and retention, pricing growth and support of strategic growth initiatives; align transportation, route management and maintenance functions at the local level; and reduce corporate overhead and staff to match organizational needs and reduce costs.\n \u2022 Increases were partially offset by the cash flow impact associated with the changes in our assets and liabilities, net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures, which are affected by both cost changes and the timing of payments. This decline is due to the unfavorable impact associated with the change in accounts payable, the unfavorable impact associated with the change in prepaid expenses, inventories and other assets and the unfavorable impact associated with the change in accounts receivable, partially offset by the favorable impact associated with the change in accrued expenses and other liabilities. \nUnder life-cycle accounting, all costs related to acquisition and construction of landfill sites are capitalized and charged to expense based on tonnage placed into each site. Landfill permitting, acquisition and preparation costs are amortized on the units-of-consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed. In determining the amortization rate for our landfills, preparation costs include the total estimated costs to complete construction of the landfills' permitted and expansion capacity.\n \u2022 The commodity price and volume change component in fiscal year 2015 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $2.0 million from unfavorable energy pricing at our landfill gas-to-energy operations, $0.4 million from unfavorable commodity pricing and $1.0 million from lower landfill gas-to-energy and processing commodity volumes.  Acquisitions and divestitures.\n \u2022 The price change component in fiscal year 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $0.6 million from favorable collection pricing, offset by $0.6 million from unfavorable disposal pricing related primarily to landfills.  Volume.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows (in millions) for the periods indicated:\n \u2022 The acquisitions and divestitures change component in fiscal year 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $2.3 million in higher collection revenues from the acquisition of various tuck-in collection operations.  Western region operating income for fiscal year 2014 decreased by $6.7 million when compared to fiscal year 2013. The change to operating income in fiscal year 2014 is primarily attributable to the following:\nFor a description of the new accounting standards that may affect us, see Note 2, Accounting Changes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAlthough inflationary increases in costs have affected our historical operating margins, we believe that inflation generally has not had a significant impact on our operating results. Consistent with industry practice, most of our contracts provide for a pass-through of certain costs to our customers, including increases in landfill tipping fees and in some cases fuel costs, intended to mitigate the impact of inflation on our operating results. We have also implemented a number of operating efficiency programs that seek to improve productivity and reduce our service costs and a fuel and oil recovery fee, which is designed to recover escalating fuel price fluctuations above an annually reset floor. Based on these implementations, we believe we should be able to sufficiently offset most cost increases resulting from inflation. However, competitive factors may require us to absorb at least a portion of these cost increases. Additionally, management's estimates associated with inflation have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities.\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings, claims and regulatory matters, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. We determine whether to disclose or accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote, reasonably possible or probable, and whether it can be reasonably estimated. We analyze our litigation and regulatory matters based on available information to assess the potential liabilities. Management's assessment is developed based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies. We accrue for loss contingencies when such amounts are probable and reasonably estimable. If a contingent liability is only reasonably possible, we will disclose the potential range of the loss, if estimable. We record losses related to contingencies in cost of operations or general and administration expenses, depending on the nature of the underlying transaction leading to the loss contingency. Contingent liabilities accounted for under purchase accounting are recorded at their fair values. These fair values may be different from the values we would have otherwise recorded, had the contingent liability not been assumed as part of an acquisition of a business. See Note 4, Business Acquisitions for disclosure over a contingent liability assumed as part of the acquisition of a business.\nWe have a dedicated business development team that identifies acquisition candidates, categorizes the opportunity by strategic fit and perceived level of financial accretion, establishes contact with the appropriate representative of the acquisition candidate and gathers further information on the acquisition candidate.\nThe table below shows, for the periods indicated, revenues (in millions) based on our operating segments:\nContract Settlement Charge\nIn calendar year 2014, eight month period 2013 and fiscal year 2014, we recorded charges of $0.4 million, $0.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively, for severance costs associated with various planned reorganization efforts including the divestiture of Maine Energy.\n \u2022 a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition; \nGeneral and administration expenses include management, clerical and administrative compensation and overhead, professional services and costs associated with marketing, sales force and community relations efforts.\n \u2022 Other: We recorded a $0.6 million gain associated with the divestiture of a business, which included the sale of certain assets associated with various waste collection routes, and a $3.8 million gain associated with the disposal of certain assets of the CARES water treatment facility and certain of our equipment and real estate in a related transaction in fiscal year 2015. In fiscal year 2014, we recorded an impairment charge of $7.5 million to the abandoned asset group of CARES.  Western Region - Transition Period 2014 compared to Unaudited Eight Month Period 2013\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities. Cash flows from operating activities increased by $12.5 million for transition period 2014 when compared to eight month period 2013.\nDiscontinued operations in eight month period 2013 and fiscal years 2014 and 2013 represent the result of operations related to the business disposition of BioFuels. In fiscal year 2014, we executed a purchase and sale agreement with ReEnergy, pursuant to which we agreed to sell certain assets of BioFuels, which is located in our Eastern region, to ReEnergy.\n \u2022 The increase in revenues for transition period 2014 is primarily the result of higher commodity volumes and the acquisition of the remaining 50% membership interest of Tompkins in December 2013. \n Cost of Operations\n \u2022 Solid waste revenues in fiscal year 2014 generated by our fuel and oil recovery fee program, which is based on a fuel index, decreased when compared to the prior fiscal year as our floating rate recovery fee declined in response to lower diesel fuel index prices on which the surcharge is based.  Commodity price and volumes.\nShelf Registration\nInvestments in unconsolidated entities over which we have significant influence over the investees' operating and financing activities are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, as applicable. Investments in affiliates in which we do not have the ability to exert significant influence over the investees' operating and financing activities are accounted for under the cost method of accounting.\nAs of January 29, 2016, we owned and/or operated 34 solid waste collection operations, 44 transfer stations, 18 recycling facilities, nine Subtitle D landfills, four landfill gas-to-energy facilities and one landfill permitted to accept C&D materials.\nOther Expenses\n \u2022 General and administration: General and administration costs increased by $2.0 million primarily due to: an increase in personnel costs, including recruitment and relocation costs, and an increase in bad debt expense primarily due to collectability issues associated with two disposal customers. \n\nOther revenues increased $11.3 million during transition period 2014 as compared to eight month period 2013 primarily as a result of higher volumes associated with organic business growth within our Customer Solutions business and, to a lesser extent, the acquisition of an industrial service management business in September 2013 and commodity volume increases within our Organics business.\n Price.\nThe fair value of each stock option is estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimation, including estimates of the expected term option holders will retain their vested stock options before exercising them and the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term.\n \u2022 Other: Other significant charges include the contract settlement charge of $1.9 million in fiscal year 2015, the reversal of $1.1 million of excess costs to complete the divestiture of Maine Energy in fiscal year 2015, the $1.0 million environmental remediation charge associated with the environmental remediation at our Southbridge landfill in calendar year 2014, severance costs associated with various planned reorganization efforts in calendar year 2014, and a $1.4 million write off of deferred costs associated with a gas pipeline development project no longer deemed to be viable in calendar year 2014. \n \u2022 Proceeds from divestiture transactions. We divested a business, certain assets of the CARES water treatment facility, and other equipment of ours as a result of the CARES transaction for cash consideration of $5.3 million in fiscal year 2015.  Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities. Cash flows from financing activities decreased $28.8 million during fiscal year 2015 when compared to calendar year 2014.\nIn addition to the financial covenants described above, the ABL Facility agreement also contains a number of important customary affirmative and negative covenants which restrict, among other things, our ability to sell assets, incur additional debt, create liens, make investments, and pay dividends. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all covenants under the ABL Facility agreement. We do not believe that these restrictions impact our ability to meet future liquidity needs.\nAccounts receivable - trade represent receivables from customers for collection, transfer, recycling, disposal and other services. Our accounts receivable - trade are recorded when billed or when related revenue is earned, if earlier, and represent claims against third-parties that will be settled in cash. The carrying value of our accounts receivable - trade, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, represents its estimated net realizable value. Estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical collection experience, current trends, credit policy and a review of our accounts receivable - trade by aging category. Our reserve is evaluated and revised on a monthly basis. Past-due accounts receivable-trade are written off when deemed to be uncollectible.\n \u2022 Fiscal year 2015 revenues decreased primarily as the result of unfavorable commodity prices in the marketplace, partially offset by higher commodity volumes and higher tipping fees. \nThe following is a summary of our operating cash flows (in millions) for fiscal year 2015 and calendar year 2014:\nChange in Fiscal Year\nRecovery of Long-Lived Assets\n \u2022 Debt activity. We issued an additional $60.0 million of 2019 Notes and refinanced our Senior Credit Facility resulting in an increase in both debt borrowings and debt payments in fiscal year 2015. In the aggregate, we were able to pay down $15.8 million, net, of long-term debt in fiscal year 2015, including the purchase for settlement of $14.7 million aggregate principal amount 2019 Notes, whereas we increased our long-term debt by $15.3M, net in calendar year 2014. \nIf an impairment indicator occurs, we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. We group our long-lived assets for this purpose at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are primarily independent of the cash flows of other assets or asset groups. If the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value.\n Solid waste revenues\nPrice.\n \u2022 Other amortization expense increased during transition period 2014 due to an increase in our intangible assets due to acquisitions made in transition period 2014 and the timing of various acquisitions made in fiscal year 2014.  Depreciation and Amortization - Fiscal Year 2014 compared to Fiscal Year 2013\nNew York Bonds\nWestern Region\nGain on Settlement of Acquisition Related Contingent Consideration\n \u2022 Direct operational costs increased $4.2 million due to: higher equipment rental costs; higher operating costs (including grounds maintenance and gas control) at certain of our landfills; and higher leachate disposal costs at certain of our landfills due to unusually high rainfall earlier in the year. These cost increases were partially offset by lower gas treatment costs at Juniper Ridge and lower depletion of landfill operating lease obligations at Southbridge and certain of our Western region landfills. \nFinal capping activities include the installation of liners, drainage, compacted soil layers and topsoil over areas of a landfill where total airspace has been consumed and waste is no longer being received. Final capping activities occur throughout the life of the landfill. Our engineering personnel estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the acreage to be capped, along with the final capping materials and activities required. The estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. The engineers then quantify the landfill capacity associated with each final capping event and the costs for each event are amortized over that capacity as waste is received at the landfill.\nOur general and administration expenses increased $4.9 million, or 0.4% as a percentage of revenues, when comparing transition period 2014 to eight month period 2013.\n \u2022 Cost of operations: Cost of operations increased by $19.1 million in fiscal year 2014 primarily due to: an increase in third-party direct costs associated with higher disposal volumes from organic customer growth and the acquisition of BBI and other operations, partially offset by a reduction of transportation costs associated with the divestiture of Maine Energy; and an increase in direct operational costs including labor, fuel, equipment rentals, landfill gas treatment costs at one of our landfills and fleet maintenance and repair costs associated with the integration of the BBI vehicle fleet, partially offset by a reduction of facility costs associated with the divestiture of Maine Energy. \nEnvironmental Remediation Liabilities\nThe change in the components of depreciation and amortization expense when comparing transition period 2014 to eight month period 2013 can primarily be attributed to the following:\n \u2022 The volume change component in fiscal year 2015 total solid waste revenues growth is primarily the result of $6.7 million from higher disposal volumes and $3.7 million from higher collection volumes. \n Price.\n \u2022 Cost of operations: Cost of operations increased by $1.8 million primarily due to: additional labor costs due to higher collection and transfer station volumes associated with new municipal contracts and organic customer growth; higher operating costs at one of our landfills; and higher facility and fleet maintenance costs. These costs were partially offset by lower diesel fuel prices, lower gas treatment costs at Juniper Ridge, lower operating costs associated with our Worcester landfill closing and the expiration of an out-of-market put-or-pay waste disposal contract. \nNet cash flows provided by operating activities. Cash flows provided by operating activities increased by $5.7 million for fiscal year 2014 when compared to fiscal year 2013.\n \u2022 The commodity price and volume change component in transition period 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is primarily the result of lower power generation and processing commodity volumes. \nInterest Expense, net - Transition Period 2014 compared to Unaudited Eight Month Period 2013\n \u2022 Cost of operations: Cost of operations increased by $6.0 million due to: an increase in third-party direct costs associated with higher hauling costs driven by transfer station volume growth (including the addition of new operating contracts for municipality-owned transfer stations) and landfill volume growth, partially offset by lower disposal costs driven by the winding down of business at CARES and lower collection volumes; an increase in other operational costs, including healthcare, depletion of landfill operating lease obligations (due to increased landfill volumes), host community fees and royalties fees, and maintenance costs associated with our fleet, hauling facilities and landfill facilities. These costs were partially offset by decreased fuel costs associated with lower diesel fuel prices in the marketplace. \nSelf-Insurance Liabilities and Related Costs\n \u2022 Improved operational performance in fiscal year 2014 as revenues increased by $42.3 million, whereas cost of operations and general and administration costs increased only $35.3 million and remained consistent as a percentage of revenues. \n \u2022 The price change component in fiscal year 2015 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $8.9 million from favorable collection pricing and $1.6 million from favorable disposal pricing associated primarily with our landfills and transfer stations.  Volume.\n \u2022 Fuel costs decreased $6.0 million due to lower diesel fuel prices in the marketplace. The favorable impact associated with lower diesel fuel prices was more than offset by interrelated higher recycling tipping fees, lower fuel and oil recovery fees, lower recycling commodity pricing and lower energy pricing revenues during fiscal year 2015.  Cost of Operations - Transition Period 2014 compared to Unaudited Eight Month Period 2013\nCost of operations includes labor costs, tipping fees paid to third-party disposal facilities, fuel costs, maintenance and repair costs of vehicles and equipment, workers' compensation and vehicle insurance costs, the cost of purchasing materials to be recycled, third-party transportation costs, district and state taxes, host community fees and royalties. Cost of operations also includes accretion expense related to final capping, closure and post-closure obligations, leachate treatment and disposal costs and depletion of landfill operating lease obligations.\nThe following table provides details associated with the period-to-period change in revenues (dollars in millions) attributable to services provided:\nOur interest expense, net increased $2.0 million in fiscal year 2015 as compared to calendar year 2014 due to higher average debt balances combined with changes to our capitalization structure associated with various tax exempt debt borrowings, the issuance of additional 2019 Notes and the refinancing of our Senior Credit Facility. In fiscal year 2015, we also experienced interest savings when we repurchased and permanently retired $14.7 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes, our most expensive debt, at a weighted average repurchase price of $101.0.\n\nIf the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value for a reporting unit, an impairment charge would be recorded to earnings. The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. After a goodwill impairment loss is recognized, the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill becomes its new accounting basis.\nOther - Fiscal Year 2014 compared to Fiscal Year 2013\nIn fiscal year 2015, we issued an additional $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes. The additional 2019 Notes, which are both fungible and issued under the same indenture as the $325.0 million 2019 Notes previously issued, were issued at a discount of $0.5 million to be accreted over the remaining term of the 2019 Notes. We used the net proceeds from this issuance, together with the initial borrowings under our new ABL Facility, to refinance our Senior Credit Facility. Additionally, in fiscal year 2015, we repurchased and permanently retired $14.7 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes at a weighted average repurchase price of $101.0 in order to maximize interest savings by paying down our most expensive debt.\n \u2022 Payments of financing costs. We had a $6.4 million increase in deferred financing cost payments in fiscal year 2015 related primarily to the issuance of an additional $60.0 million of 2019 Notes and $15.0 million of Finance Authority of Maine Solid Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds Series 2015 (\u201cFAME Bonds 2015\u201d) and the refinancing of our Senior Credit Facility. \n (1) Based on debt and capital lease balances as of December 31, 2015. Interest obligations related to variable rate debt were calculated using variable rates in effect at December 31, 2015. \n \u2022 Third-party direct costs increased $0.2 million due to: higher collection and disposal volumes from organic customer growth, including various new contracts, and various acquisitions; and higher commodity volumes in the Recycling segment. These cost increases were offset by lower purchased material costs associated with declining commodity prices within the Recycling segment; lower purchased material costs in our Customer Solutions business; and the expiration of an out-of-market put-or-pay waste disposal contract in the Eastern region. \nPrior to these transactions, we recorded income from equity method investments of $0.1 million in calendar year 2014 and losses from our equity method investments of $1.0 million, $0.9 million and $4.4 million in eight month period 2013, fiscal year 2014 and fiscal year 2013.\n \u2022 Professional fees increased $0.9 million due to: accounting and auditing services associated with the change in fiscal year-end; higher legal costs associated with third-party legal advice, including a legal settlement with the New York Attorney General; and a loss accrued for a potential legal settlement with the MADEP. See discussion in Part I, Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nDivestitures\n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization: Depreciation and amortization costs increased $1.4 million in fiscal year 2014 due to the following: an increase in landfill amortization costs associated with higher landfill volumes; an increase in estimated costs associated with our Worcester landfill in closure status; and depreciation expense savings associated with the divestiture of Maine Energy. \nTo determine fair value, we use discounted cash flow analyses and estimates about the future cash flows of the asset or asset group. This analysis includes a determination of an appropriate discount rate, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates. The cash flows employed in our discounted cash flow analyses are typically based on financial forecasts developed internally by management. The discount rate used is commensurate with the risks involved. We may also rely on third-party valuations and or information available regarding the market value for similar assets.\n Price.\nSolid waste revenues\n \u2022 Depreciation expense decreased $1.0 million due to the divestiture of Maine Energy in the third quarter of fiscal year 2013, which reduced our depreciable asset base for all of fiscal year 2014. \nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nPursuant to Section 2.19 of the indenture governing the 2019 Notes and the provisions of the FAME Bonds 2015, FAME Bonds 2005R-2, New Hampshire Bonds, New York Bonds and Vermont Bonds, no beneficial holder of the 2019 Notes, FAME Bonds 2015, FAME Bonds 2005R-2, New Hampshire Bonds, New York Bonds and/or Vermont Bonds is permitted to knowingly acquire 2019 Notes, FAME Bonds 2015, FAME Bonds 2005R-2, New Hampshire Bonds, New York Bonds and/or Vermont Bonds if such person would own 10% or more of the consolidated debt for which relevant subsidiaries of ours are obligated (and must dispose of 2019 Notes, FAME Bonds 2015, FAME Bonds 2005R-2, New Hampshire Bonds, New York Bonds and/or Vermont Bonds or other debt of ours to the extent such person becomes aware of exceeding such threshold), if such ownership would require consent of any regulatory authority under applicable law or regulation governing solid waste operators and such consent has not been obtained. We will furnish to the holders of the 2019 Notes, FAME Bonds 2015, FAME Bonds 2005R-2, New Hampshire Bonds, New York Bonds and Vermont Bonds, in each quarterly and annual report, the dollar amount of our debt that would serve as the threshold for evaluating a beneficial holder's compliance with these ownership restrictions. As of December 31, 2015, that dollar amount was $51.6 million.\nThe following table provides details associated with the period-to-period change in revenues (dollars in millions) attributable to services provided:\nWe no longer account for our investment in Tompkins using the equity method of accounting and began including the accounts of Tompkins in our consolidated financial statements.\nGeneral and Administration - Fiscal Year 2015 compared to Unaudited Calendar Year 2014\n \u2022 Labor and related benefit costs increased $2.3 million due to: the acquisition of BBI; processing higher volumes of commodities through our Recycling segment; and lower productivity as a result of prolonged inclement winter weather. \n \u2022 Proceeds from the sale of equity method investment. During eight month period 2013, we and LP sold our membership interests in GreenFiber. After netting indebtedness of GreenFiber and transaction costs, our 50% of the net cash proceeds amounted to $2.8 million. \nIn addition to an annual goodwill impairment assessment, we would evaluate a reporting unit for impairment if events or circumstances change between annual tests indicating a possible impairment. Examples of such events or circumstances include the following:\nIntangible assets consist primarily of covenants not-to-compete and customer lists. Intangible assets are recorded at fair value and are amortized based on the economic benefit provided or using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Covenants not-to-compete and customer lists are typically amortized over a term of no more than 10 years.\n \u2022 The fuel and oil recovery fee change component in fiscal year 2015 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of lower revenues generated by our fuel and oil recovery fee program in response to lower diesel fuel index prices on which the surcharge is based.  Organics revenues\n \u2022 The acquisitions and divestitures change component in transition period 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of various solid waste hauling operation acquisitions completed between August 2013 and September 2014.  Western region operating income increased $1.6 million during transition period 2014 as compared to eight month period 2013. The change in operating income is primarily attributable to the solid waste revenues growth discussed above combined with the following cost changes:\nCash Flow Activity - Fiscal Year 2014 compared to Fiscal Year 2013\nIn addition to the above obligations, we have unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2015 of approximately $0.4 million. Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with the unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2015, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates as to the timing of cash settlements. For a description of our commitments and contingencies, see Note 8, Final Capping, Closure and Post-Closure Costs, Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies and Note 14, Income Taxes, of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWestern Region - Fiscal Year 2015 compared to Unaudited Calendar Year 2014\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \u2022 The volume change component in fiscal year 2015 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $10.7 million from higher disposal volumes (of which $5.0 million relates to higher landfill volumes, $4.9 million relates to higher transportation volumes and $0.8 million relates to higher transfer station volumes associated with two new transfer station contracts), partially offset by $2.3 million from lower processing volumes and $2.3 million from lower collection volumes.  Fuel and oil recovery fee.\nOur interest expense, net increased $0.2 million in transition period 2014 as compared to eight month period 2013 as interest expense associated with higher average debt balances in transition period 2014 was partially offset by interest savings associated with a reduction to our outstanding letters of credit.\n \u2022 we are actively working on obtaining any necessary permits and we expect that all required permits will be received; and \n \u2022 Acquisitions, net of cash acquired. During fiscal year 2014, we acquired various businesses including several solid waste hauling operations, a transfer station, a MRF and an industrial service management business (included in the Other segment) for total consideration of $10.1 million, of which we have made $8.5 million in cash payments. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, we recovered $0.2 million of the purchase price holdback amount we had previously paid and were relieved of any potential contingent consideration obligation associated with the acquisition of an industrial service management business in fiscal year 2014. This is compared to fiscal year 2013, when we acquired six solid waste hauling operations in the Western region and acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of BBI in the Eastern region for total consideration of $28.0 million, of which we paid $24.8 million in cash and made $0.5 million in holdback payments in fiscal year 2013. \nIn the fiscal year ended April 30, 2012, we entered into two forward starting interest rate derivative agreements that were initially being used to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the forecasted financing transaction to redeem our Second Lien Notes. The total notional amount of these agreements was $150.0 million and required us to receive interest based on changes in LIBOR and pay interest at a rate of approximately 1.40%. During fiscal year 2013, we dedesignated both of the $75.0 million forward starting interest rate derivative agreements and discontinued hedge accounting in accordance with FASB ASC 815-30 because the interest payments associated with the forecasted financing transaction were no longer deemed probable. We recognized a $3.6 million loss, reclassified\nIn fiscal year 2015, we recorded a contract settlement charge of $1.9 million associated with the Expera Old Town, LLC v. Casella Waste Systems, Inc. legal matter. See Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further disclosure.\nIn each of transition period 2014 and calendar year 2014, we recorded an environmental remediation charge of $1.0 million associated with remediation performed at our Southbridge landfill in the Eastern region. We had previously recorded an environmental remediation charge of $0.4 million in eight month period 2013 and fiscal year 2014 associated with remediating this site.\n \u2022 The fuel and oil recovery fee change component in fiscal year 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of lower revenues being generated by our fuel and oil recovery fee program in response to lower diesel fuel index prices on which the surcharge is based.  Organics revenues\nVolume.\nSee Note 14, Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further disclosure.\nThe change in the components of depreciation and amortization expense when comparing fiscal year 2014 to fiscal year 2013 can primarily be attributed to the following:\nOther operating income decreased by $1.7 million during transition period 2014 when compared to eight month period 2013 as increased revenues were more than offset by increased third-party direct costs (including hauling and purchased material costs associated primarily with our Customer Solutions business and, to a lesser extent, hauling costs associated with our Organics business) and labor and related benefit costs associated with growth in our Customer Solutions business.", "item_7_text": " \u2022 Fiscal year 2015 revenues increased from higher volumes due to organic business growth, partially offset by the pass through impact of unfavorable commodity prices in the marketplace. \nOur provision for income taxes from continuing operations for fiscal year 2015 increased $0.1 million to $1.4 million from $1.3 million in calendar year 2014. The provision (benefit) for income taxes decreased $0.5 million in transition period 2014 to $0.7 million from $1.2 million in eight month period 2013, and increased $4.3 million in fiscal year 2014 to $1.8 million from ($2.5) million in fiscal year 2013. The provisions for income taxes for fiscal year 2015 and calendar year 2014 include deferred tax provisions of $0.8 and $1.2 million, respectively, and transition period 2014 and eight month period 2013 include deferred tax provisions of $0.6 million and $1.0 million, respectively. The change in the provisions for income taxes and the total deferred tax provisions in these periods are primarily related to the deferred tax liability for indefinite lived assets. Since we cannot determine when the deferred tax liability related to indefinite lived assets will reverse, this amount cannot be used as a future source of taxable income against which to benefit deferred tax assets. The change in the provisions (benefits) for income taxes for fiscal year 2014 and fiscal year 2013 is primarily related to a ($5.1) million deferred tax benefit in fiscal year 2013 due to a reduction of the valuation allowance in connection with the recording of deferred tax liabilities related to the BBI acquisition, offset by $0.8 million in fiscal year 2013 related to a settlement with the State of New York for corporate franchise tax for tax years April 30, 2004 through April 30, 2010.\nNet cash used in investing activities. Cash flows used in investing activities decreased by $31.6 million for fiscal year 2014 when compared to fiscal year 2013.\nRecycling revenues increased $4.5 million during transition period 2014 when compared to eight month period 2013. The increase in revenues is primarily the result of higher commodity volumes, and the acquisition of the remaining 50% membership interest of Tompkins.\n \u2022 The increase in revenues for fiscal year 2014 is primarily the result of higher volumes.  Customer solutions revenues\n \u2022 Tender premium and costs. We paid a tender premium and tender costs of $10.7 million in fiscal year 2013 in connection with the redemption of the Second Lien Notes. \n \u2022 Professional fees increased $1.1 million due to $1.9 million of consulting and legal fees resulting from our responses to the advance notice of nomination sent to us by an activist investor nominating its own candidates for election as directors at our 2015 Annual Meeting in opposition to the three candidates whom we recommended. That activist investor ultimately withdrew its slate of director candidates prior to the 2015 Annual Meeting and all of our director nominees were elected at the 2015 Annual Meeting by our stockholders. These costs were partially offset by lower accounting and audit fees associated with timing changes based on our change in fiscal year-end to December 31st. \nThe following table provides details associated with the period-to-period change in revenues (dollars in millions) attributable to services provided:\nfrom accumulated other comprehensive loss, as loss on derivative instruments in fiscal year 2013 and recognize the change in fair value of the interest rate swaps along with any cash settlements through earnings as gain or loss on derivative instruments. The agreements were both scheduled to mature on March 15, 2016. However, in February 2015 we settled one of the forward starting interest rate derivative agreements for $0.8 million.\n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization: Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $1.0 million due to an increase in landfill volumes and an amortization rate adjustment at one of our landfills as a result of updating cost estimates and other assumptions associated with the annual year-end review of our landfills. \n \u2022 The solid waste operations commodity price and volume change component in transition period 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $0.2 million from lower power generation and processing commodity volumes, partially offset by $0.1 million from favorable commodity pricing within power generation.  Acquisitions and divestitures.\nRemaining Permitted Airspace\n \u2022 The price change component in transition period 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $2.5 million from favorable collection pricing and $0.1 million from favorable disposal pricing associated with our landfills.  Volume.\nFrom time to time, we may sell or divest certain investments or other components of our business. These divestitures may be undertaken for a number of reasons, including: to generate proceeds to pay down debt; as a result of a determination that the specified asset will provide inadequate returns to us or that the asset no longer serves a strategic purpose in connection with our business; or as a result of a determination that the asset may be more valuable to a third-party. We will continue to look to divest certain activities and investments that no longer enhance or complement our core business if the right opportunity presents itself.\n \u2022 Stock issuance. We sold 11.5 million shares of Class A common stock in fiscal year 2013 and received net proceeds from the registered public offering of $42.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. \nWe have made in the past, and we may make in the future, acquisitions in order to acquire or develop additional disposal capacity. These acquisitions may include \u201ctuck-in\u201d acquisitions within our existing markets, assets that are adjacent to or outside of our existing markets, or larger, more strategic acquisitions. In addition, from time to time, we may acquire businesses that are complementary to our core business strategy. We face considerable competition for acquisition targets, particularly the larger and more meaningful targets, due to among other things, our limited access to and weighted average cost of capital, but we believe that our strong relationships and reputation in New England and the upstate New York area help to offset these factors.\n \u2022 The commodity price and volume change component in fiscal year 2015 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of unfavorable energy pricing within our landfill gas-to-energy operations, unfavorable commodity pricing, and lower landfill gas-to-energy and processing commodity volumes.  Acquisitions and divestitures.\nSenior Subordinated Notes\n Cash Flow Activity - Fiscal Year 2015 compared to Unaudited Calendar Year 2014\nRecycling revenues\nDevelopment Project Charge\n \u2022 The price change component in transition period 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $1.7 million from favorable collection pricing and $0.1 million from favorable disposal pricing related to transfer stations.  Volume.\n \u2022 The acquisitions and divestitures change component in transition period 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of increased revenues from various business acquisitions, including several solid waste hauling operations and a transfer station, completed between August 2013 and October 2014.  Closed landfill.\nOur loss from discontinued operations, net in fiscal year 2013 includes a $3.3 million loss associated with the adjustment to the carrying value of BioFuels to its fair value as a result of the planned business disposition of BioFuels.\n \u2022 The price change component in fiscal year 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $2.9 million from favorable collection pricing, partially offset by $0.4 million from unfavorable disposal pricing associated with our landfills.  Volume.\nAfter determining the costs and the remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills, we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons. We calculate per ton amortization rates for assets associated with each final capping event, for assets related to closure and post-closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future for each landfill. These rates per ton are updated annually, or more frequently, as significant facts change.\n Price.\n \u2022 The commodity price and volume change component in fiscal year 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $2.5 million from favorable commodity pricing within power generation, partially offset by $1.4 million from lower power generation and processing volumes and $0.4 million from unfavorable commodity pricing within processing. \nIn each of fiscal year 2014 and calendar year 2014, we recorded a charge of $1.4 million for deferred costs associated with a gas pipeline development project no longer deemed viable.\n \u2022 General and administration: General and administration expenses increased by $3.0 million primarily due to higher shared overhead costs, higher bad debt expense associated with an increase in the reserve for a specific landfill customer and higher personnel costs. \n \u2022 Landfill amortization expense increased $3.5 million due to: an increase in landfill volumes in the Eastern region and at certain of our landfills within the Western region; an increase in estimated final capping and closure costs associated with our Worcester landfill in the Eastern region; and additional post-closure costs associated with the extension of our post-closure commitment at various closed landfills. \nIn transition period 2014, we completed a financing transaction involving the issuance of $11.0 million in aggregate principal amount of New Hampshire Bonds, consisting of the conversion and remarketing of $5.5 million principal amount New Hampshire Bonds from a variable rate to a fixed term rate and the issuance of an additional $5.5 million principal amount fixed term rate New Hampshire Bonds.\n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization: Depreciation and amortization costs increased by $2.2 million primarily due to to increased landfill amortization associated with the allocation of landfill volumes. \nThe following is a summary of our cash and cash equivalents, restricted assets and debt balances (in millions):\nInterest Expense, net\nOur general and administration expenses increased $6.1 million, or 0.6% as a percentage of revenues, for fiscal year 2015 when compared to calendar year 2014.\nWe are self-insured for vehicles and workers' compensation with reinsurance coverage limiting our maximum exposure. Our maximum exposure in fiscal year 2015 under the workers' compensation plan was $1.0 million per individual event. Our maximum exposure in fiscal year 2015 under the automobile plan was $1.2 million per individual event. The liability for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, is determined by management with the assistance of a third-party actuary and reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as an accrued liability. We use a third-party to track and evaluate actual claims experience for consistency with the data used in the annual actuarial valuation. The actuarially determined liability is calculated based on historical data, which considers both the frequency and settlement amount of claims. Our estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly different than our ultimate obligations if variables such as the frequency or severity of future events differ significantly from our assumptions.\n \u2022 The commodity price and volume change component in transition period 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $0.6 million from lower power generation and processing commodity volumes. \n Summary of Cash Flow Activity\n \u2022 Change in restricted cash. We had $5.8 million in restricted cash associated with the issuance of the New York Bonds. \n \u2022 Distribution to noncontrolling interest holder. In fiscal year 2015, we distributed $1.5 million to Altela representing its pro-rata share of the proceeds associated with the disposal of certain assets of CARES. \nAcquisitions and divestitures.\nLimitations on Ownership of Notes\nSee Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 16, Divestiture Transactions and Discontinued Operations to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further disclosure.\n \u2022 the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within the segment.  We elected to perform a quantitative analysis as part of our annual goodwill impairment test in fiscal year 2015. As of December 31, 2015, the Step 1 testing for goodwill impairment performed for the Eastern, Western, Recycling and Customer Solutions reporting units indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount, including goodwill. Furthermore, the Step 1 test indicated that in each case the fair value of the Eastern, Western, Recycling and Customer Solutions reporting units exceeded its carrying value by in excess of 22.9%. We incurred no impairment of goodwill as a result of our annual goodwill impairment tests in fiscal year 2015 and transition period 2014. However, there can be no assurance that goodwill will not be impaired at any time in the future.\n The most significant items affecting the change in our operating cash flows are summarized below:\n \u2022 Other costs increased $1.2 million due to higher property taxes, insurance costs and service agreements. \nThe following table provides details associated with the period-to-period change in revenues (dollars in millions) attributable to services provided:\nLoss on Disposal of Discontinued Operations\nAcquisitions and divestitures.\n \u2022 The fuel and oil recovery fee change component in fiscal year 2015 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of lower revenues generated by our fuel and oil recovery fee program in response to lower diesel fuel index prices on which the surcharge is based.  Commodity price and volume.\n The table below shows, for the periods indicated, operating income (loss) (in millions) based on our operating segments:\nIn June 2014, we elected to change our fiscal year-end from April 30th to December 31st. The change in fiscal year became effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2015 and ending December 31, 2015. As a result of this change, financial results for fiscal year 2015 are compared to the unaudited financial results for calendar year 2014, and the financial results for transition period 2014 are compared to the unaudited financial results for eight months 2013. When financial results for fiscal year 2014 are compared to financial results for fiscal year 2013, the results are presented on the basis of our previous fiscal year-end on a twelve month basis.\n \u2022 Labor and related benefit costs increased $5.7 million due to additional personnel costs associated with acquisitions, growth in our Customer Solutions business, recruitment and relocation, and an increase in incentive compensation costs. \n \u2022 Labor and related benefit costs increased $3.8 million due to: additional labor costs associated with growth in our Customer Solutions business; increased overall healthcare costs; and increased incentive compensation costs. \nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding $370.3 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes, which will mature on February 15, 2019. The 2019 Notes accrue interest at the rate of 7.75% per annum and interest is payable semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The 2019 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by substantially all of our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee our ABL Facility.\nLandfill Development Costs\nSeverance and Reorganization Costs\nRevenues - Fiscal Year 2015 compared to Unaudited Calendar Year 2014\n \u2022 The increase in revenues for transition period 2014 is the result of higher volumes associated with organic business growth. \n \u2022 The closed landfill change component in fiscal year 2015 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of our Worcester landfill, which ceased operations in April 2014 in accordance with its permit. \nOur cost of operations increased $22.6 million, or 0.8% as a percentage of revenues, for transition period 2014 when compared to eight month period 2013.\nPrice.\n \u2022 Labor and related benefit costs increased $3.3 million due to: additional labor costs due to higher collection and transfer station volumes in the Eastern region associated with new municipal contracts and organic customer growth; processing of higher commodity volumes due to new contracts and facilities in the Recycling segment; and lower productivity as a result of prolonged inclement winter weather into the early spring of 2015. \nCustomer solutions revenues\nTax-Exempt Financings\n \u2022 Debt activity. We experienced a reduction in both debt payments, by $208.5 million, due primarily to the full redemption of the Second Lien Notes in fiscal year 2013, and debt borrowings, by $214.7 million, due primarily to the offering of $125.0 million in additional 2019 Notes in fiscal year 2013, resulting in a $6.2 million decrease in cash flows related to debt activity in fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013. \nRecycling revenues decreased $2.0 million during fiscal year 2015 when compared to calendar year 2014. The decrease in revenues is the result of unfavorable commodity prices in the marketplace, partially offset by higher commodity volumes and higher tipping fees.\nThe following table provides details associated with the period-to-period change in revenues (dollars in millions) attributable to services provided:\nVolume.\n \u2022 The acquisitions and divestitures change component in fiscal year 2015 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of increased revenues from the acquisition of a solid waste hauling operations in September 2014, partially offset by decreased revenues associated primarily with an asset exchange in December 2014 and the divestiture of a business in May 2015. \nMaine Bonds\nRegional Economic Conditions\n \u2022 The price change component in transition period 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $0.8 million from favorable collection pricing. \nNet cash provided by operating activities. Cash flows from operating activities increased by $8.3 million during fiscal year 2015 when compared to calendar year 2014.\n \u2022 The closed landfill change component in fiscal year 2015 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of our Worcester landfill, which stopped accepting waste and ceased operations in April 2014 in accordance with its permit.  Fuel and oil recovery fee.\n \u2022 an impairment of goodwill at a reporting unit.  There are certain indicators listed above that require significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry when applied to landfill development or expansion. For example, a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit application although the expansion permit is ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace. Therefore, certain events could occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be considered indicators of impairment due to the unique nature of the waste industry.\nThe most significant items affecting the change in our financing cash flows are summarized below:\n \u2022 Landfill amortization expense increased during transition period 2014 due to: an increase in landfill volumes at our Southbridge landfill in the Eastern region and at certain of our landfills within the Western region; and an increase in estimated final capping and closure costs at our Worcester landfill. \nIn connection with this transaction, we also sold certain of our equipment and real estate to the same unrelated third-party for total consideration of $1.1 million, resulting in a gain of $0.9 million in fiscal year 2015.\nIn fiscal year 2015, we completed a financing transaction involving the issuance of $15.0 million in aggregate principal amount of FAME Bonds 2015. We borrowed the proceeds of the offering of the FAME Bonds 2015 to finance or refinance the costs of certain of our solid waste landfill facilities and solid waste collection, organics and transfer, recycling and hauling facilities, and to pay for the costs of the issuance of the FAME Bonds 2015. As of December 31, 2015, we had $1.3 million of restricted cash reserved for repayment of costs incurred to fund certain capital projects in the State of Maine as a result of this financing.\n (2) Includes obligations related to landfill operating lease contracts. \n \u2022 Maintenance and repair costs increased $3.9 million due to: higher fleet maintenance costs in the Eastern and Western regions and higher facility maintenance costs associated with our Recycling segment and our Eastern region landfills. \n \u2022 The price change component in fiscal year 2015 total solid waste revenues growth is primarily the result of favorable collection pricing. \nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands) and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years:\nAsset-Based Lending Facility\nAs of December 31, 2015, we owned 9.8% of the outstanding equity value of GreenerU, Inc. (\u201cGreenerU\u201d), a services company focused on providing energy efficiency, sustainability and renewable energy solutions to colleges and universities. In fiscal year 2015, it was determined based on the operating performance and recent third-party interest in GreenerU that our cost method investment in GreenerU was potentially impaired. A valuation analysis was performed by a third-party valuation specialist using a market approach based on an option pricing methodology to determine an equity value and fair market value per share for GreenerU. Based on this analysis, it was determined that the fair value of our cost method investment in GreenerU was less than the carrying amount and, therefore, we recorded an other-than-temporary investment impairment charge of $0.7 million in fiscal year 2015. As of December 31, 2015, the carrying amount of our cost method investment in GreenerU is $0.3 million.\nGeneral and Administration - Transition Period 2014 compared to Unaudited Eight Month Period 2013\nIf the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment occurs. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized.\nOther operating income for fiscal year 2014 increased by $3.8 million when compared to fiscal year 2013 as increased revenues, combined with cost savings associated with a change in our organizational and management structure and the head count reduction that took place as a part of the reorganization fiscal year 2013, more than offset increased hauling and transportation costs associated with our Organics business and transportation services and increased third-party direct costs associated with the acquisition of an industrial service management business within our Customer Solutions business.\nDepreciation and Amortization\n \u2022 an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long-lived asset; \nAs of December 31, 2015, we owned 5.3% of the outstanding common stock of Recycle Rewards, Inc. (\u201cRecycle Rewards\u201d), a company that markets an incentive based recycling service. In both fiscal year 2015 and transition period 2014, it was determined based on the operating performance of Recycle Rewards that our cost method investment in Recycle Rewards was potentially impaired. As a result, we performed a valuation analysis in fiscal year 2015, and had a valuation analysis performed by a third-party valuation specialist in transition period 2014, both of which used an income approach based on discounted cash flows to determine an equity value for Recycle Rewards in order to properly value our cost method investment in Recycle Rewards. Based on these analyses, it was determined in each case that the fair value of our cost method investment in Recycle Rewards was less than the carrying amount and, therefore, we recorded other-than-temporary investment impairment charges of $1.1 million in fiscal year 2015 and $2.3 million in each of calendar year 2014 and transition period 2014. As of December 31, 2015, the carrying amount of our cost method investment in Recycle Rewards is $1.1 million.\nThe change in the components of depreciation and amortization expense when comparing fiscal year 2015 to calendar year 2014 can primarily be attributed to the following:\nNew Hampshire Bonds\nSee Note 4, Business Combinations and Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further disclosure.\n \u2022 Direct operational costs increased $1.5 million due to: higher depletion of landfill operating lease obligations associated with increased volumes received at our landfills; an increase in host community fees and royalties; higher equipment rental costs associated with an increase in fleet and landfill equipment rentals; an increase in gas treatment costs at Juniper Ridge; and a lower gain on sale of fixed assets in transition period 2014. \n \u2022 a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life; or \nDuring transition period 2014, we acquired one solid waste hauling operation in each of the Eastern and Western regions for total consideration of $0.4 million, including $0.3 million in cash and $0.1 million in holdbacks to the sellers.\nEastern Region - Fiscal Year 2015 compared to Unaudited Calendar Year 2014\n \u2022 Other: Other charges impacting operating income include the CARES impairment in fiscal year 2014 and severance costs associated with realignment and streamlining of functions to improve our cost structure in fiscal year 2013.  Recycling\nThe period-to-period change in general and administration expenses can be primarily attributed to the following:\nThe $0.1 million expense from divestiture, acquisition and financing costs recorded in each of eight month period 2013 and fiscal year 2014 is primarily associated with legal costs related to the acquisition of the remaining 50% membership interest of Tompkins.\nClosed landfill.\nThe table below shows revenue attributable to services provided (in millions) for the following periods:\n Price.\nWe continually assess whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that may warrant revision of the estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets (other than goodwill) or whether the remaining balances of those assets should be evaluated for possible impairment. Long-lived assets include, for example, capitalized landfill costs, other property and equipment, and identifiable intangible assets. Events or changes in circumstances that may indicate that an asset may be impaired include the following:\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding $21.4 million aggregate principal amount of Finance Authority of Maine Solid Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds Series 2005R-2 (\u201cFAME Bonds 2005R-2\u201d). The FAME Bonds 2005R-2, which are unsecured and guaranteed jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally by all of our significant wholly-owned subsidiaries, accrue interest at 6.25% per annum through January 31, 2017, at which time they may be converted from a fixed to a variable rate, and interest is payable semiannually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year. The FAME Bonds 2005R-2 mature on January 1, 2025.\nThe period-to-period change in general and administration expenses can be primarily attributed to the following:\n\n \u2022 The commodity price and volume change component in fiscal year 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $2.2 million from favorable commodity pricing, primarily within power generation, partially offset by $1.7 million from lower volumes within power generation and processing.  Acquisitions and divestitures.\n \u2022 Change in restricted cash. We added $5.6 million of restricted assets associated with the issuance of the FAME Bonds 2015 that represent restricted cash reserved for repayment of costs incurred to fund certain capital projects in the State of Maine, and used $10.0 million of the restricted cash associated with the issuance of the FAME Bonds 2015 and the $5.8 million of New York State Environmental Facilities Corporation Solid Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds Series 2014 (\u201cNew York Bonds\u201d) issued in calendar year 2014, to pay down ABL Facility borrowings used to finance certain capital projects in the States of New York and Maine. \n \u2022 The acquisitions and divestitures change component in fiscal year 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $16.7 million in increased revenues from acquisitions, primarily associated with our acquisition of BBI in December 2012, and our acquisition of four solid waste hauling operations and a transfer station in fiscal year 2014. Increased revenues were partially offset by $7.4 million in decreased revenues associated with the Maine Energy divestiture.  Closed landfill.\nCARES and Related Transaction. CARES is a joint venture that owned and operated a water and leachate treatment facility for the natural gas drilling industry in Pennsylvania. Our joint venture partner in CARES is Altela. As of December 31, 2015, our ownership interest in CARES is 51%. In accordance with the FASB ASC 810-10-15, we consolidate the assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interest and results of operations of CARES into our consolidated financial statements due to our controlling financial interest in the joint venture.\n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization: Depreciation and amortization costs increased $0.7 million period-to-period primarily due to an increase in landfill amortization associated with higher landfill volumes at certain landfills.  Western Region - Fiscal Year 2014 compared to Fiscal Year 2013\nWhen we assess the carrying value of our investments for potential impairment, determining the fair value of our investments is reliant upon the availability of market information and/or other information provided by third-parties to be able to develop an estimate of fair value. Additionally, considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, our estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we, or other holders of these investments, could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different assumptions and/or estimation methodologies could have a significant effect on the estimated fair values. The current estimates of fair value could differ significantly from the amounts presented.\nThe table below shows, for the periods indicated, the components of depreciation and amortization expense (in millions):\nOur interest expense, net decreased $3.5 million in fiscal year 2014 when compared to fiscal year 2013. The decrease in interest expense, net during fiscal year 2014 can primarily be attributed to lower interest rates associated with the refinancing in October and November 2012 of $180.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Second Lien Notes. Interest savings were partially offset by an increase in interest expense associated with higher average debt balances in fiscal year 2014, associated primarily with borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility to help fund operations and meet cash flow needs.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding $11.0 million aggregate principal amount of New Hampshire Bonds. The New Hampshire Bonds, which are unsecured and guaranteed jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally by all of our significant wholly-owned subsidiaries, accrue interest at 4.00% per annum through October 1, 2019, at which time they may be converted from a fixed rate to a variable rate, and interest is payable in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The New Hampshire Bonds mature on April 1, 2029. We borrowed the proceeds of the New Hampshire Bonds to repay borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility for qualifying property, plant and equipment assets purchased in the state of New Hampshire.\n \u2022 General and administration: General and administration costs increased $0.9 million in fiscal year 2014 primarily due to additional personnel costs associated with the BBI acquisition and an increase in estimated incentive compensation costs. \nStock-Based Compensation\nIn December 2013, we sold our 50% membership interest in GreenFiber and purchased the remaining 50% membership interest of Tompkins, both of which were previously accounted for using the equity method of accounting.\nGeneral and Administration - Fiscal Year 2014 compared to Fiscal Year 2013\n \u2022 Capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were $17.5 million lower in the fiscal year 2015 due to the timing of various landfill development projects, along with various calendar year 2014 capital expenditures associated with a new recycling facility contract, various transfer stations and the installation of a landfill gas treatment system at Juniper Ridge. \nSale of Business. In fiscal year 2015, we divested a business, which included the sale of certain assets associated with various waste collection routes in the Western region, for total consideration of $0.9 million, resulting in a gain of $0.6 million.\nRecycling revenues increased $1.5 million during fiscal year 2014 when compared to fiscal year 2013. The increase in revenues is due to higher commodity volumes and the acquisition of the remaining 50% membership interest of Tompkins.\nThe most significant items affecting the change in our investing cash flows are summarized below:\nWe have filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC pursuant to which we may from time to time issue securities in an amount of up to $190.0 million, after giving consideration to the $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of additional 2019 Notes we issued in February 2015 pursuant to this registration statement.\nDiscontinued Operations\n \u2022 Acquisitions, net of cash acquired. During eight month period 2013, cash outflows associated with acquisitions totaled $8.5 million as compared to $0.4 million in transition period 2014 based on the respective acquisition activity. The timing and size of acquisitions are dependent upon opportunity and our access to capital.  Net cash provided by financing activities. Cash flows provided by financing activities decreased $1.8 million during transition period 2014 when compared to eight month period 2013.\nWe acquired various businesses during fiscal year 2014, including several solid waste hauling operations, a transfer station, a MRF and an industrial service management business (included in the Other segment) for total consideration of $10.1 million, including $7.9 million in cash, $1.7 million in contingent consideration and holdbacks to the sellers and $0.5 million of other non-cash considerations. We recovered $0.2 million of the purchase price holdback amount we had previously paid and were relieved of any potential contingent consideration obligation associated with the acquisition of an industrial service management business earlier in fiscal year 2014. As a result, we recorded a $1.1 million gain on settlement of acquisition related contingent consideration in fiscal year 2014.\n \u2022 a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group; \nEastern Region - Fiscal Year 2014 compared to Fiscal Year 2013\n Price.\n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization: Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $0.1 million due to higher amortization expense associated with an increase in overall landfill tons and changes to certain of our landfill amortization rates as a part of the annual year-end review of our landfills, mostly offset by a decrease in depreciation expense associated with a lower depreciable asset base. \n \u2022 we have not identified any legal or political impediments which we believe will not be resolved in our favor; \nInflation\nThe operating results of the operations discussed above have been included in discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nEastern Region - Transition Period 2014 compared to Unaudited Eight Month Period 2013\nThe period-to-period change in cost of operations can be primarily attributed to the following:\nIn fiscal year 2014, we determined that assets of the CARES water treatment facility were no longer operational or were not operating within product performance parameters. As a result, we initiated a plan to abandon and shut down the operations of CARES. It was determined that the carrying value of the assets of CARES was no longer recoverable and, as a result, the carrying value of the asset group was assessed for impairment and impaired. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $7.5 million in each of fiscal year 2014 and calendar year 2014 to the asset group of CARES in the Western region.\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, and other financial information, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.\nOur general and administration expense increased $3.7 million, or 0.4% as a percentage of revenues, for fiscal year 2014 when compared to fiscal year 2013.\n \u2022 Maintenance and repair costs increased $4.8 million due to: higher facility maintenance costs associated with our Recycling segment, our hauling operations, certain landfills in our Western and Eastern regions, and the acquisition of a transfer station in the Eastern region; and higher fleet repair and maintenance costs associated with hauling operations. \nSee Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further disclosure.\n Facility, was 4.75 as of December 31, 2015. The consolidated leverage ratio is used to set pricing according to the ABL Facility agreement and there is no financial covenant associated with this ratio. A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to minimum consolidated EBITDA is as follows (in millions): \nRevenues - Transition Period 2014 compared to Unaudited Eight Month Period 2013\nOur engineers, in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and surveyors, are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills. The remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey, which is then used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography.\nWe currently include unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances. To be considered expansion airspace all of the following criteria must be met:\n \u2022 General and administration: General and administration expenses increased by $4.5 million primarily due to higher shared overhead costs and an increase in incentive compensation. \nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding $3.6 million aggregate principal amount of Finance Authority of Maine Solid Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds Series 2005R-1 (\u201cFAME Bonds 2005R-1\u201d). The FAME Bonds 2005R-1 are variable rate bonds secured by a letter of credit issued by our administrative agent bank and interest is payable semiannually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year. The FAME Bonds 2005R-1 mature on January 1, 2025. We borrowed the proceeds of the FAME Bonds 2005R-1 and 2005R-2 to pay for certain costs relating to the following: landfill development and construction; the acquisition of vehicles, containers and related equipment for solid waste collection and transportation services; improvements to existing solid waste disposal, hauling, transfer station and other facilities; other infrastructure improvements; and the acquisition of machinery and equipment for solid waste disposal operations owned and operated by us, or a related party, all located in Maine.\n \u2022 Improved operational performance in the transition period 2014 as revenues increased by $28.3 million, partially offset by higher cost of operations and general and administration costs, which increased by $27.5 million or 1.2% as a percentage of revenues. \nNew Accounting Standards\nThe indenture governing the 2019 Notes contains certain negative covenants which restrict, among other things, our ability to sell assets, make investments in joint ventures, pay dividends, repurchase stock, incur debt, grant liens and issue preferred stock. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all covenants under the indenture governing the 2019 Notes, and we do not believe that these restrictions impact our ability to meet future liquidity needs except that they may impact our ability to increase our investments in non-wholly owned entities, including the joint ventures to which we are already party.\nAs a result of the sale of our 50% membership interest in GreenFiber, we recorded a gain on sale of equity method investment of $0.8 million in eight month period 2013, which included a $0.2 million working capital adjustment to the purchase price that was finalized upon closing of the transaction in January 2014. We had initially recorded a gain on sale of equity method investment of $0.6 million in fiscal year 2014 as a result of the sale.\nOther revenues increased $12.2 million during fiscal year 2014 when compared to fiscal year 2013. Increased revenues for fiscal year 2014 was primarily the result of higher volumes within our Organics business and organic growth and the acquisition of an industrial service management business within our Customer Solutions business in fiscal year 2014.\nThe period-to-period change in general and administration expenses can be primarily attributed to the following:\nRecycling revenues\nImpairment of Investments\n \u2022 Labor and related benefit costs increased $4.9 million due to: increased overall healthcare costs and increased labor costs associated with higher collection and transfer station volumes in the Eastern region and new contracts and facilities in the Recycling segment. \nThere were no acquisitions in fiscal year 2015.\nThe $1.4 million expense from divestiture, acquisition and financing costs recorded in fiscal year 2013 is associated with the following fiscal year 2013 events: a $0.3 million write-off of costs associated with the full refinancing of our 11.0% senior second lien notes (\u201cSecond Lien Notes\u201d) in fiscal year 2013, $0.6 million of legal costs associated with the Maine Energy divestiture transaction, and $0.5 million of costs associated with the BBI acquisition.\nAll share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period. Stock-based compensation expense is based on the number of awards ultimately expected to vest and is therefore reduced for an estimate of the awards that are expected to be forfeited prior to vesting.\nIn the first step (defined as \u201cStep 1\u201d) of testing for goodwill impairment, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit, which we have determined to be our geographic operating segments, our Recycling segment and our Customer Solutions business, which is included in the Other segment, and compare the fair value with the carrying value of the net assets of each reporting unit. If the fair value is less than its carrying value, then we would perform a second step (defined as \u201cStep 2\u201d) and determine the fair value of the goodwill. In Step 2, the fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit's identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole, as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated.\nFounded in 1975 with a single truck, Casella Waste Systems, Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries and certain partially owned entities over which it has a controlling financial interest, is a regional, vertically-integrated solid waste services company. We provide resource management expertise and services to residential, commercial, municipal and industrial customers, primarily in the areas of solid waste collection and disposal, transfer, recycling and organics services. We provide integrated solid waste services in six states: Vermont, New Hampshire, New York, Massachusetts, Maine and Pennsylvania, with our headquarters located in Rutland, Vermont. We manage our solid waste operations on a geographic basis through two regional operating segments, the Eastern and Western regions, each of which provides a full range of solid waste services, and our larger-scale recycling and commodity brokerage operations through our Recycling segment. Organics services, ancillary operations, industrial services, discontinued operations, and earnings from equity method investees, as applicable, are included in our Other segment.\n \u2022 The closed landfill change component in fiscal year 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of our Worcester landfill, which stopped accepting waste in fiscal year 2013 based on the attainment of its permitted capacity. The impact of the closure was limited in fiscal year 2014 as we were granted a permit in May 2013 to accept an additional 0.2 million tons of waste. We began placing additional waste pursuant to the permit at the end of June 2013 and ceased placing tons in April 2014.  Eastern region operating loss decreased $4.2 million during fiscal year 2014 when compared to fiscal year 2013. The change in operating income is primarily attributable to the following cost changes:\nOutstanding Long-Term Debt\nThe following table provides details associated with the period-to-period change in revenues (dollars in millions) attributable to services provided:\nWe executed a purchase and sale agreement in fiscal year 2015 pursuant to which we and Altela agreed to sell certain assets of the CARES water treatment facility to a third-party. We sold these assets of CARES for purchase consideration of $3.5 million, resulting in a gain of $2.9 million in fiscal year 2015, 49% of which was attributable to Altela, the noncontrolling interest holder. As of December 31, 2015, we continued to pursue the dissolution of CARES in accordance with the CARES agreement.\n \u2022 Interest payments decreased $6.2 million in fiscal year 2014 due to the timing of payments, as well as lower interest rates as a result of the refinancing in October and November of 2012 of $180.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 11.0% Second Lien Notes. This reduction was partially offset by an increase in interest payments associated with higher average debt balances. \n \u2022 Labor and related benefit costs increased $3.7 million due to higher wages and salaries, higher incentive compensation costs, and higher equity compensation costs. \nWe manage our solid waste operations, which include a full range of solid waste services, on a geographic basis through two regional operating segments, which we designate as the Eastern and Western regions. Revenues in our Eastern and Western regions consist primarily of fees charged to customers for solid waste collection and disposal, landfill, landfill gas-to-energy, transfer and recycling services. We derive a substantial portion of our collection revenues from commercial, industrial and municipal services that are generally performed under service agreements or pursuant to contracts with municipalities. The majority of our residential collection services are performed on a subscription basis with individual households. Landfill and transfer customers are charged a tipping fee on a per ton basis for disposing of their solid waste at our disposal facilities and transfer stations. We also generate and sell electricity at certain of our landfill facilities. In addition, revenues from our Recycling segment consist of revenues derived from municipalities and customers in the form of processing fees, tipping fees and commodity sales. Organics services, ancillary operations, major account and industrial services, discontinued operations, and earnings from equity method investees, as applicable, are included in our Other segment. Our revenues are shown net of inter-company eliminations.\n Eastern Region\nOther - Transition Period 2014 compared to Unaudited Eight Month Period 2013\nOther revenues decreased $0.1 million during fiscal year 2015 when compared to calendar year 2014 primarily due to volume declines in our Organics business associated with lower commodity volumes and a decline in our floating rate fuel and oil recovery fee in response to lower diesel fuel index prices on which the surcharge is based, and a decline in transportation volumes. This was partially offset by organic business growth within our Customer Solutions business.\nWe estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity (see landfill development costs discussed within the \u201cProperty, Plant and Equipment\u201d accounting policy more fully discussed in Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). The projection of these landfill costs is dependent, in part, on future events. The remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized, net of accumulated airspace amortization, and projections of future purchase and development costs including capitalized interest. The interest capitalization rate is based on our weighted average interest rate incurred on borrowings outstanding during the period.\nThe following table provides details associated with the period-to-period change in revenues (dollars in millions) attributable to services provided:\n \u2022 Payments related to investments. During eight month period 2013, we made investments in unconsolidated entities totaling $2.0 million, whereas we made no payments related to investments in transition period 2014. \nOther\n Based on the seasonality of our business, operating results in the late fall, winter and early spring months are generally lower than the remainder of our fiscal year. Given the cash flow impact that this seasonality, the capital intensive nature of our business and the timing of debt payments has on our business, we typically incur higher debt borrowings from the ABL Facility in order to meet our liquidity needs during these times. Consequently, our availability and performance against our financial covenants tighten during these times as well.\nThe cost estimates for final capping, closure and post-closure activities at landfills for which we have responsibility are estimated based on our interpretations of current requirements and proposed or anticipated regulatory changes. We also estimate additional costs based on the amount a third-party would charge us to perform such activities even when we expect to perform these activities internally. We estimate the airspace to be consumed related to each final capping event and the timing of construction related to each final capping event and of closure and post-closure activities. Because landfill final capping, closure and post-closure obligations are measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques, changes in the estimated timing of construction of future landfill final capping and closure and post-closure activities would have an effect on these liabilities, related assets and results of operations.\nThe period-to-period change in cost of operations can be primarily attributed to the following:\n \u2022 The closed landfill change component in transition period 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of our Worcester landfill, which ceased operations in April 2014 in accordance with its permit.  Organics revenues\nWe monitor and assess the carrying value of our investments throughout the year for potential impairment and write them down to their fair value when other-than-temporary declines exist. Fair value is generally based on (i) other third-party investors' recent transactions in the securities; (ii) other information available regarding the current market for similar assets and/or (iii) a market or income approach, as deemed appropriate.\nIt is possible that actual results, including the amount of costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and post-closure activities, our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To the extent that such estimates or related assumptions prove to be significantly different than actual results, lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates, higher final capping, closure or post-closure rates, or higher expenses. Higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs. Most significantly, if it is determined that the expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of the landfill asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment. If it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion permit has become remote, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately.\n \u2022 Direct operational costs increased $5.6 million due to: higher costs at our landfills (including increases in leachate treatment costs due to the timing of cell development, landfill gas treatment costs and maintenance costs); higher equipment rental costs associated with an increase in fleet and landfill equipment rentals; an increase in host and royalty fees and higher depletion of landfill operating lease obligations due to increased volumes received at our landfills; and an increase in vehicle insurance costs. \n \u2022 Cost of operations: Cost of operations increased by $9.5 million, resulting in margin erosion as costs increased at a greater rate than revenues. The change was primarily due to: an increase in third-party direct costs associated with higher collection and disposal volumes from new municipal contracts, organic customer growth and the acquisition of a transfer station; and an increase in other operational costs, including labor (which is driven by higher collection and transfer volumes), healthcare, depletion of landfill operating lease obligations at Southbridge, and maintenance costs associated with hauling operations and certain of our landfills. These costs were partially offset by a decrease in fleet and landfill equipment rentals, as well as host community fees and royalties; lower accretion expense related to accrued final capping, closure and post-closure costs associated with our Worcester landfill; and lower leachate treatment costs. \nResults of Operations\nWe recognized a $0.4 million loss on disposal of discontinued operations in fiscal year 2014 associated with the BioFuels disposition.\n (3) Contractual cash obligations do not include accounts payable or accrued liabilities, which will be paid in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. \nMaine Energy. In fiscal year 2013, we executed a purchase and sale agreement with the City of Biddeford, Maine, pursuant to which we agreed to sell the real property of Maine Energy to the City of Biddeford. We agreed to sell Maine Energy for an undiscounted purchase consideration of $6.7 million, which is being paid to us in installments over twenty-one years. Later in fiscal year 2013, we closed the transaction, ceased operations of the Maine Energy facility, and initiated the decommissioning, demolition and site remediation process in accordance with the provisions of the agreement. In fiscal year 2015, we completed the demolition process and site remediation under the auspices and in accordance with work plans approved by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection and the EPA. Based on the total incurred costs to fulfill our obligation under the agreement, we reversed a reserve of $1.1 million of excess costs to complete the divestiture in fiscal year 2015.\n \u2022 Professional fees decreased $1.3 million due to lower legal costs associated with fewer ongoing legal proceedings and lower consulting costs. \n Depreciation and Amortization - Fiscal Year 2015 compared to Unaudited Calendar Year 2014\nSenior Credit Facility. In fiscal year 2015, we recorded a charge of $0.5 million as a loss on debt extinguishment related to the write-off of deferred financing costs in connection with changes to the borrowing capacity from the Senior Credit Facility to the ABL Facility. The remaining unamortized deferred financing costs of the Senior Credit Facility, along with fees paid to the creditor and third-party costs incurred for the ABL Facility, are to be amortized over the term of the ABL Facility.\n \u2022 Cost of operations: Cost of operations increased by $12.0 million primarily due to: an increase in third-party direct costs related to increased collection and transfer station volumes, a shift in volumes to external haulers, and an increase in state, local and other disposal fees associated with higher taxes due to a shift in mix type; an increase in direct operational costs associated with higher labor, equipment rentals and leases, depletion of landfill operating lease obligations and host community fees; and an increase in vehicle and facility maintenance costs. \n \u2022 The acquisitions and divestitures change component in fiscal year 2015 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of increased revenues from the acquisition of two solid waste hauling operations in September and October 2014, partially offset by decreased revenues associated primarily with an asset exchange in December 2014 and the divestiture of a business in May 2015. \n \u2022 The closed landfill change component in fiscal year 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of our Worcester landfill, which stopped accepting waste and ceased operations in April 2014 in accordance with its permit. \n \u2022 an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; \nWe account for income tax uncertainties according to guidance on the recognition, de-recognition and measurement of potential tax benefits associated with tax positions. We recognize interest and penalties relating to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense.\nIncome (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, net\nOther operating income increased by $0.5 million during fiscal year 2015 when compared to calendar year 2014 based on the operating performance of our Customer Solutions business. Profitability in the Customer Solutions business improved as we continued to gain leverage on higher revenues and lower general and administration costs.\n (2) As of December 31, 2015, borrowing availability was calculated as a borrowing base of $148.5 million, less revolver borrowings of $57.5 million, less outstanding irrevocable letters of credit totaling $26.9 million, at which date no amount had been drawn.  As of December 31, 2015, our additional financial ratio covenants, as defined in the ABL Facility agreement (if they would have been applicable) were as follows:\n \u2022 The acquisitions and divestitures change component in transition period 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of the acquisition of two solid waste hauling operations, one in September 2013 and another in October 2014, and a transfer station in November 2013.  Closed landfill.\nThe period-to-period changes in cost of operations can be primarily attributed to the following:\n \u2022 The increase in revenues for transition period 2014 is the result of $7.9 million from higher volumes and $1.0 million from the acquisition of an industrial service management business in September 2013.  Recycling revenues\nRecycling operating loss for fiscal year 2014 increased by $1.7 million when compared to fiscal year 2013 due to extended inclement weather that resulted in lower operating productivity and reduced processing throughput, along with unplanned maintenance activities.\n \u2022 Maintenance costs increased $4.8 million due to: higher vehicle maintenance costs associated with the integration of the BBI vehicle fleet; higher facility costs associated with unplanned maintenance activities within the Recycling segment; and higher container repair costs. \nRecycling operating loss decreased by $0.8 million during transition period 2014 when compared to eight month period 2013 due to increased revenues and improved operating efficiencies, partially eroded by higher commodity purchased material costs, higher labor and healthcare costs, and increased facility maintenance activities.\n\nSee Note 11, Stockholders Deficit to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further disclosure.\nThe following table provides details associated with the period-to-period change in revenues (dollars in millions) attributable to services provided:\nCash Flow Activity - Transition Period 2014 compared to Unaudited Eight Month Period 2013\n \u2022 The volume change component in fiscal year 2015 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $16.8 million from higher disposal volumes (of which $8.4 million relates to higher landfill volumes, $4.1 million relates to higher transfer station volumes associated with two new transfer station contracts and organic growth, and $4.3 million relates to transportation) and $1.4 million from higher collection volumes, partially offset by $2.0 million from lower processing volumes (mainly water treatment and recycling processing).  Commodity price and volume.\nOur business is primarily located in the northeastern United States. Therefore, our business, financial condition and results of operations are susceptible to downturns in the general economy in this geographic region and other factors affecting the region, such as state regulations and severe weather conditions. We are unable to forecast or determine the timing and/or the future impact of a sustained economic slowdown.\nThere were no divestitures in transition period 2014.\nSegment Reporting\nAccounts Receivable - Trade, Net of Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nSale of Business. In fiscal year 2015, we divested a business, which included the sale of certain assets associated with various waste collection routes in the Western region, for total consideration of $0.9 million, resulting in a gain of $0.6 million.\nSecond Lien Notes. In fiscal year 2013, we recorded a charge of $15.6 million as a loss on debt extinguishment related to the full refinancing of our Second Lien Notes. The loss on debt extinguishment consisted of a $2.8 million non-cash write off of deferred financing costs, a $2.1 million non-cash write off of the unamortized original issue discount and a $10.7 million charge associated with the early tender premium and tender fees associated with the redemption of the Second Lien Notes.\nBioFuels. As a part of the disposition of BioFuels, we agreed to complete certain site improvements that were completed in transition period 2014. As a result, we recorded a $0.6 million gain in each of transition period 2014 and calendar year 2014 associated with reversing the excess remaining reserves not needed to complete the site improvements.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \u2022 Fiscal year 2015 revenues decreased as the result of lower volumes and a decline in our floating rate fuel and oil recovery fee in response to lower diesel fuel index prices on which the surcharge is based.  Customer solutions revenues\n \u2022 Debt activity. We had both an increase in debt borrowings, $26.6 million (associated with the issuance of the New York and New Hampshire Bonds, along with higher capital expenditures), and debt payments, $20.6 million (associated with the pay down of our Senior Credit Facility using the net proceeds from the issuance of New York Bonds and New Hampshire Bonds). \n If the borrowing availability is less than a minimum availability threshold determined in accordance with the ABL Facility agreement, we are then subject to additional financial ratio covenants. As of December 31, 2015, our borrowing availability was greater than the minimum availability threshold as follows (in millions):\nEnvironmental Remediation Charge\nGoodwill and Other Intangibles\nWe may assess whether a goodwill impairment exists using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment. If we perform a qualitative assessment, it involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If based on this qualitative assessment we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we will not perform a quantitative assessment. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative assessment, or two-step impairment test, to determine whether goodwill impairment exists at the reporting unit.\nTo determine the fair value of each of our reporting units as a whole we use discounted cash flow analyses, which require significant assumptions and estimates about the future operations of each reporting unit. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the determination of appropriate discount rates, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates. The cash flows employed in our discounted cash flow analyses are based on financial forecasts developed internally by management. Our discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of our risk adjusted discount rate, applicable for each reporting unit. In assessing the reasonableness of our determined fair values of our reporting units, we evaluate our results against our current market capitalization\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions\n \u2022 senior management has approved the project.  For unpermitted airspace to be included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, the expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above. These criteria are evaluated annually by our engineers, accountants, lawyers, managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits. Once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards, an airspace utilization factor (\u201cAUF\u201d) is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons. The AUF is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys. When we include the expansion airspace in our calculation of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, we include the projected costs for development, as well as the projected asset retirement costs related to final capping, closure and post-closure of the expansion airspace in the amortization basis of the landfill.\n \u2022 The commodity price and volume change component in fiscal year 2014 total solid waste revenues growth remained consistent year over year with increased revenues from higher commodity volumes slightly eclipsing decreased revenues from unfavorable pricing.  Acquisitions and divestitures.\nInterest Expense, net - Fiscal Year 2015 compared to Unaudited Calendar Year 2014\nRevenues - Fiscal Year 2014 compared to Fiscal Year 2013\n \u2022 Payment of financing costs. We made lower payments of financing costs of $4.2 million in fiscal year 2014 due primarily to the offering of $125.0 million in additional 2019 Notes in fiscal year 2013. \nRecycling - Fiscal Year 2014 compared to Fiscal Year 2013\nRecycling operating loss increased by $0.7 million during fiscal year 2015 when compared to calendar year 2014 as operating results were negatively impacted by unfavorable commodity prices, higher hauling and labor costs, increased facility maintenance activities and higher shared overhead costs, partially offset by higher processing fees charged to third-party and intercompany customers.\n \u2022 a more likely than not expectation that a segment or a significant portion thereof will be sold; or \n \u2022 The volume change component in transition period 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $7.0 million from higher disposal volumes (of which $4.4 million relates to higher landfill volumes, $2.2 million relates to higher transfer station volumes associated with two new transfer station contracts, and $0.4 million relates to higher transportation volumes), partially offset by $1.3 million from lower collection volumes and $0.3 million from lower processing volumes.  Commodity price and volume.\n \u2022 The increase in revenues for fiscal year 2014 is the result of $2.6 million from higher volumes and $5.3 million from the acquisition of an industrial service management business. \nAcquisitions\nThe preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, as applicable, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of their evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances. Our significant accounting policies are more fully discussed in Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nClosure and post-closure costs represent future estimated costs related to monitoring and maintenance of a solid waste landfill after a landfill facility ceases to accept waste and closes. We estimate, based on input from our engineers, lawyers, accounting personnel and consultants, our future cost requirements for closure and post-closure monitoring and maintenance based on our interpretation of the technical standards of the Subtitle D regulations and the air emissions standards under the Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended, as they are being applied on a state-by-state basis. Closure and post-closure accruals for the cost of monitoring and maintenance include site inspection, groundwater monitoring, leachate management, methane gas control and recovery, and operation and maintenance costs to be incurred for a period which is generally for a term of 30 years after final closure of a landfill. In determining estimated future closure and post-closure costs, we consider costs associated with permitted and permittable airspace.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding $16.0 million aggregate principal amount Vermont Economic Development Authority Solid Waste Disposal Long-Term Revenue Bonds Series 2013 (\u201cVermont Bonds\u201d). The Vermont Bonds, which are unsecured and guaranteed jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally by all of our significant wholly-owned subsidiaries, accrue interest at 4.75% per annum through April 1, 2018, at which time they may be converted from a fixed rate to a variable rate, and interest is payable semiannually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The Vermont Bonds mature on April 1, 2036. We borrowed the proceeds of the Vermont Bonds to repay borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility for qualifying property, plant and equipment assets purchased in the state of Vermont.\nWe acquired various solid waste hauling operations during fiscal year 2013, including the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of BBI in the Eastern region, for total consideration of $27.9 million in cash and approximately 0.6 million shares of our Class A common stock, valued at an aggregate of $2.7 million. We recorded an additional $5.1 million to goodwill for the increased deferred tax liability related to the BBI acquisition based on the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amount recognized for income tax purposes. See Note 14, Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. The acquisition of BBI, a provider of solid waste collection, transfer and liquid waste services in New Hampshire and Maine, provided us the opportunity to internalize additional waste and recyclables and to consolidate operations, routes and transportation within the Eastern region.\n \u2022 The volume change component in transition period 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $10.6 million from disposal volume increases (of which $6.4 million relates to higher transfer station volumes associated with a mix shift from landfills to transfer stations and four new transfer station contracts, $3.3 million relates to landfills and $0.9 million relates to transportation) and $1.1 million from collection volume increases.  Commodity price and volume.\n Solid waste revenues\nContingent Liabilities\nThe following is a summary of our operating cash flows (in millions) for transition period 2014 and eight month period 2013:\nVermont Bonds\nIncome Taxes\nThe following is a summary of our operating cash flows (in millions) for fiscal year 2014 and fiscal year 2013:\nThe most significant items affecting the change in our financing cash flows are summarized below:\n \u2022 The price change component in fiscal year 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $2.3 million from favorable collection pricing and $0.1 million from favorable disposal pricing related primarily to transfer stations.  Volume.\n \u2022 Investments in unconsolidated entities. During fiscal year 2014, we made investments in unconsolidated entities totaling $2.1 million compared to $3.2 million in fiscal year 2013. \n \u2022 The volume change component in fiscal year 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $15.1 million from disposal volume increases (of which $7.3 million relates to landfills, $5.3 million relates to transfer stations and $2.5 million relates to transportation), $3.1 million from collection volume increases and $0.8 million from processing volume increases. \n \u2022 Other: Other charges impacting operating income included a $1.0 million environmental remediation charge recorded in transition period 2014 and a $0.4 million environmental remediation charge recorded in eight month period 2013 associated with the environmental remediation at Southbridge. \nBioFuels. In fiscal year 2013, we initiated a plan to dispose of BioFuels and as a result, the assets associated with BioFuels were classified as held-for-sale and the results of operations were recorded as income from discontinued operations. Assets of the disposal group previously classified as held-for-sale, and subsequently included in discontinued operations, included certain inventory along with plant and equipment. In fiscal year 2014, we executed a purchase and sale agreement with ReEnergy Lewiston LLC (\u201cReEnergy\u201d), pursuant to which we agreed to sell certain assets of BioFuels, which was located in our Eastern region, to ReEnergy. We agreed to sell the BioFuels assets for undiscounted purchase consideration of $2.0 million, which was to be paid to us in equal quarterly installments over five years commencing November 1, 2013, subject to the terms of the purchase and sale agreement. The related note receivable was paid in full by ReEnergy in transition period 2014. We recognized a $0.4 million loss on disposal of discontinued operations in fiscal year 2014 associated with the disposition. As a part of the divestiture, we agreed to complete certain site improvements at Biofuels, which were completed in transition period 2014. As a result, we recorded a $0.6 million gain in transition period 2014 associated with reversing the excess remaining reserves not needed to complete the site improvements.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding $25.0 million aggregate principal amount of New York Bonds. The New York Bonds, which are unsecured and guaranteed jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally by all of our significant wholly-owned subsidiaries, accrue interest at 3.75% per annum through December 1, 2019, at which time they may be converted from a fixed rate to a variable rate, and interest is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year. An additional $15.0 million aggregate principal amount of New York Bonds may be offered under the same indenture in the future. The New York Bonds mature on December 1, 2044.\n \u2022 Other: Other charges impacting operating loss in fiscal year 2014 include: a $1.4 million write off of deferred costs in fiscal year 2014 associated with a gas pipeline development project no longer deemed to be viable; a $0.4 million environmental remediation charge recorded in fiscal year 2014 associated with the remediation of Southbridge; severance costs associated primarily with realignment and the streamlining of functions to improve our cost structure and the divestiture of Maine Energy in the third quarter of fiscal year 2013; legal costs associated with the Maine Energy divestiture transaction; and costs associated directly with the BBI acquisition. \nThe ABL Facility consists of a revolving credit facility with loans thereunder being available up to an aggregate principal amount of $190.0 million, subject to availability under a borrowing base formula as defined in the ABL Facility agreement. We have the right to request, at our discretion, an increase in the amount of loans under the ABL facility by an aggregate amount of $100.0 million, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the ABL Facility agreement. Interest accrues at LIBOR plus between 1.75% and 2.50%, subject to the terms of the ABL Facility agreement and is set at LIBOR plus 2.25% as of December 31, 2015. The ABL Facility matures on February 26, 2020. If we fail to refinance the 2019 Notes on or before November 16, 2018, the maturity date of the ABL Facility will be November 16, 2018. The ABL Facility is guaranteed jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally by all of our significant wholly-owned subsidiaries and is collateralized by certain qualified accounts receivable-trade, inventory and property, plant and equipment.\n \u2022 Improved cash flow impact associated with the changes in our assets and liabilities, net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures, which are affected by both cost changes and the timing of payments. This improvement is primarily due to the favorable impact associated with the change in accounts payable based on the timing of payments. This was partially offset by the unfavorable impact associated with the change in accrued expenses and other liabilities (associated primarily with the amount and timing of capping, closure and post closure payments and the timing of accrued interest payments) and the unfavorable impact associated with the change in prepaid expenses, inventories and other assets. \nFuel and oil recovery fee.\nContractual Obligations\n \u2022 General and administration: General and administration expenses increased $0.9 million primarily due to: an increase in bad debt expense in transition period 2014 associated with increased customer growth and bad debt recoveries in eight month period 2013; an increase in incentive compensation costs; and a loss accrued for a potential legal settlement with MADEP. See discussion in Part I, Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nEastern region operating income increased $9.0 million during fiscal year 2015 when compared to calendar year 2014. This improvement is primarily attributable to revenue growth outlined above and the following cost changes:\nThe following table summarizes our revenues and operating expenses (in millions) for the following periods:\n \u2022 Payments of financing costs. We had a $2.2 million increase in deferred financing cost payments related to the issuance of the New York Bonds, the issuance of $11.0 million in aggregate principal amount of tax-exempt Solid Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds Series 2013 issued by the Business Finance Authority of the State of New Hampshire (\u201cNew Hampshire Bonds\u201d), and the refinancing of our Senior Credit Facility. \nExpansion Airspace\nIn each of fiscal year 2014 and calendar year 2014, we recovered a portion of the purchase price holdback amount we had previously paid and were relieved of any potential contingent consideration obligation associated with the acquisition of an industrial service management business earlier in fiscal year 2014. As a result, we recorded a $1.1 million gain on settlement of acquisition related contingent consideration in each of fiscal year 2014 and calendar year 2014.\n (1) Minimum consolidated EBITDA is based on operating results for the twelve months preceding the measurement date, December 31, 2015. Based on the minimum consolidated EBITDA, our consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the ABL \nOperating Expenses\n The most significant items affecting the change in our operating cash flows are summarized below:\n \u2022 Improved operational performance in fiscal year 2015 as revenues increased by $20.6 million, whereas cost of operations and general and administration costs increased only $11.5 million, a decrease of 1.1% as a percentage of revenues. \n \u2022 The volume change component in fiscal year 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $5.6 million from higher disposal volumes (of which $3.0 million relates to landfill volumes, $1.6 million relates to transfer station volumes and $0.9 million relates to transportation volumes), $0.5 million from higher processing volumes and $0.2 million from higher collection volumes. \nCompany Overview\n \u2022 Cash interest payments decreased $0.3 million from $18.7 million for eight month period 2013 to $18.4 million for transition period 2014 primarily due to the timing of payments associated with changes to our capitalization structure.  Net cash used in investing activities. Cash flows used in investing activities increased by $13.9 million for transition period 2014 when compared to eight month period 2013.\n The most significant items affecting the change in our operating cash flows are summarized below:\nOther - Fiscal Year 2015 compared to Unaudited Calendar Year 2014\nSenior Subordinated Notes. In fiscal year 2015, we repurchased and permanently retired $14.7 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes at a weighted average repurchase price of $101.0 in order to maximize interest savings by paying down our most expensive debt. As a result of the repurchases, we recorded a charge of $0.5 million in fiscal year 2015 as a loss on debt extinguishment primarily related to the non-cash write off of deferred financing costs and unamortized original issue discount in proportion with the settlement amount.\n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization: Depreciation and amortization costs remained flat primarily due to lower landfill amortization associated with our Worcester landfill, which no longer accepted waste in transition period 2014, offset by an increase in other amortization associated with acquired intangible assets. \nAs of December 31, 2015, we owned 17.0% and 16.2% of the outstanding common stock of AGreen Energy LLC (\u201cAGreen\u201d) and BGreen Energy LLC (\u201cBGreen\u201d), respectively. In fiscal year 2015, AGreen and BGreen, both of which we account for as cost method investments, entered into agreements that resulted in the contribution and sale of certain assets and liabilities of AGreen and BGreen to a limited liability company in exchange for partial ownership interests in a parent of that limited liability company. As a result of the transactions, we performed an analysis to determine whether an other-than-temporary impairment in the carrying value of our cost method investments had occurred. Based on the analysis performed, which measured the fair value of our cost method investments using an in-exchange valuation premise under the market approach that utilized the estimated purchase consideration received, we recorded an other-than-temporary investment impairment charge of $0.3 million in fiscal year 2015.\n \u2022 The volume change component in fiscal year 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $7.9 million from higher disposal volumes (of which $7.2 million relates to higher landfill volumes and $3.6 million relates to higher transfer station volumes, partially offset by $2.9 million in volumes that were not retained after the divestiture of Maine Energy), $2.8 million from higher collection volumes and $0.3 million from higher processing volumes.  Commodity price and volume.\nGeneral and Administration\nFuel and oil recovery fee.\nNet cash provided by (used in) discontinued operations. Cash flows from discontinued operations increased $1.9 million during transition period 2014 when compared to eight month period 2013 due to repayment in full of the remainder of the $2.0 million note receivable associated with the business disposition of BioFuels.\nMaine Energy. In fiscal year 2013, we executed a purchase and sale agreement with the City of Biddeford, Maine, pursuant to which we agreed to sell the real property of Maine Energy to the City of Biddeford. We agreed to sell Maine Energy for an undiscounted purchase consideration of $6.7 million, which is being paid to us in installments over twenty-one years. Later in fiscal year 2013, we closed the transaction, ceased operations of the Maine Energy facility, and initiated the decommissioning, demolition and site remediation process in accordance with the provisions of the agreement. In fiscal year 2015, we completed the demolition process and site remediation under the auspices and in accordance with work plans approved by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection and the EPA. Based on the total incurred costs to fulfill our obligation under the agreement, we reversed a reserve of $1.1 million of excess costs to complete the divestiture in fiscal year 2015.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Entities\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment\n Revenues\n \u2022 Third-party direct costs increased $11.8 million due to: organic and acquisition growth in our Customer Solutions business, which has a higher inherent direct cost structure; higher collection and disposal volumes from organic customer growth and the acquisition of a transfer station in the Eastern region; higher volumes in our Organics business; and higher disposal volumes associated with four new transfer station contracts and the acquisition of various hauling operations in the Western region. \n \u2022 Improved cash flow impact associated with the changes in our assets and liabilities, net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures, which are affected by both cost changes and the timing of payments. The improvement in fiscal year 2015 was the result of the favorable cash flow impacts associated with prepaid expenses, inventories and other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities due to lower final capping, closure and post-closure payments, partially offset by the unfavorable cash flow impacts associated with accounts payable and accounts receivable.  Net cash used in investing activities. Cash flows used in investing activities decreased by $23.0 million during fiscal year 2015 when compared to calendar year 2014.\n \u2022 Landfill amortization expense increased due to: an increase in landfill volumes at our Eastern region landfills and at certain of our landfills within the Western region; and an amortization rate adjustment as a result of updating cost estimates and other assumptions associated with the annual year-end review of our landfills.  Depreciation and Amortization - Transition Period 2014 compared to Unaudited Eight Month Period 2013\nFinal Landfill Capping, Closure and Post-Closure Costs\nDepreciation and amortization includes: (i) depreciation of property and equipment, including assets recorded for capital leases, on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets; (ii) amortization of landfill costs (including those costs incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development and construction, along with asset retirement costs arising from closure and post-closure obligations) on a units-of-consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the total estimated remaining capacity of a site, which includes both permitted capacity and unpermitted expansion capacity that meets our criteria for amortization purposes; (iii) amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a units-of-consumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event and (iv) amortization of intangible assets with a definite life, using either an economic benefit provided approach or a straight-line basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements.\n \u2022 a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group; \n \u2022 The closed landfill change component in transition period 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of our Worcester landfill, which ceased operations in April 2014 in accordance with its permit.  Eastern region operating income decreased $0.5 million during transition period 2014 when compared to eight month period 2013. The change in operating income is primarily attributable to the following cost changes:\n \u2022 The acquisitions and divestitures change component in fiscal year 2015 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of increased revenues from the acquisition of a solid waste hauling operation in October 2014.  Closed landfill.\nThe following table provides details associated with the period-to-period change in revenues (dollars in millions) attributable to services provided:\nThe ABL Facility agreement requires us to maintain minimum consolidated EBITDA for the twelve months preceding the measurement date measured at the end of each fiscal quarter. Minimum consolidated EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that should not be considered an alternative to any measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the minimum consolidated EBITDA financial covenant contained in the ABL Facility agreement as follows (in millions):\nThe following table summarizes our cost of operations, general and administration expenses and depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of revenues for the following periods:\nDivestiture Transactions\nExpense from Divestiture, Acquisition and Financing Costs\nNet cash used in discontinued operations. Cash flows used in discontinued operations decreased $2.2 million for fiscal year 2014 when compared to fiscal year 2013. These fluctuations in net cash flows from discontinued operations are the result of the business disposition of BioFuels in exchange for a $2.0 million note receivable, which was to be paid to us in equal quarterly installments commencing November 1, 2013.\n \u2022 The price change component in fiscal year 2015 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $3.1 million from favorable collection pricing and $1.1 million from favorable disposal pricing related to landfills and transfer stations. \nLandfill Accounting\nCommodity price and volume.\nWestern region operating income increased $11.0 million during fiscal year 2015 when compared to the calendar year 2014. This improvement is primarily attributable to revenue growth outlined above and the following cost changes:\nCARES and Related Transaction. We executed a purchase and sale agreement in fiscal year 2015 pursuant to which we and Altela agreed to sell certain assets of the CARES water treatment facility to a third-party. We sold these assets of CARES for purchase consideration of $3.5 million, resulting in a gain of $2.9 million in fiscal year 2015, 49% of which was attributable to Altela, the noncontrolling interest holder. As of December 31, 2015, we continued to pursue the dissolution of CARES in accordance with the CARES agreement.\n \u2022 we control the land on which the expansion is sought; \nVolume.\nCost of Operations - Fiscal Year 2015 compared to Unaudited Calendar Year 2014\n \u2022 The increase in revenues for fiscal year 2014 is primarily the result of higher commodity volumes and the acquisition of the remaining 50% membership interest of Tompkins. \nWe have recorded environmental remediation liabilities representing our estimate of the most likely outcome of the matters for which we have determined that a liability is probable. These liabilities include potentially responsible party investigations, settlements, certain legal and consultant fees, as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up, such as materials and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy. We provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We estimate costs required to remediate sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred based on site-specific facts and circumstances. Estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are developed using third-party environmental engineers or other service providers. Where we believe that both the amount of a particular environmental remediation liability and timing of payments are reliably determinable, we inflate the cost in current dollars until the expected time of payment and discount the cost to present value.\nSee Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further disclosure.\nOur cost of operations increased $5.4 million, decreasing 1.7% as a percentage of revenues, for fiscal year 2015 when compared to calendar year 2014.\n \u2022 The volume change component in transition period 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $3.1 million from higher disposal volumes (which includes a mix shift in volumes from landfills to transfer stations), $2.5 million from higher collection volumes and $0.2 million from higher processing volumes.  Commodity price and volume.\n \u2022 a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset or asset group, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; \nWe annually assess goodwill impairment at the end of our fiscal year or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. Historically, we have performed our annual goodwill impairment test using our fiscal year-end, or April 30th, as the measurement date. Effective with the change in our fiscal year-end from April 30th to December 31st, we have voluntarily changed our goodwill impairment measurement date from April 30th to December 31st to coincide with the change in our fiscal year-end. The voluntary change in our goodwill impairment measurement date was applied prospectively as it represents the modification of an existing principle based on new facts and circumstances.\n \u2022 General and administration: General and administration costs remained flat due to a higher than normal bad debt expense in eight month period 2013 due to collectability issues associated with two disposal customers being offset by higher healthcare costs and increased incentive compensation costs. \nThe most significant items affecting the change in our investing cash flows are summarized below:\nThe most significant items affecting the change in our investing cash flows are summarized below:\nAcquisitions and divestitures.\nIn transition period 2014, we completed a financing transaction involving the issuance of $25.0 million in aggregate principal amount of New York Bonds. We borrowed the proceeds of the New York Bonds to repay borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility for qualifying property, plant and equipment assets purchased in the state of New York.\n \u2022 Third-party direct costs increased $17.4 million due to: organic and acquisition growth in our Customer Solutions business; higher volumes in our Organics business; higher collection and disposal volumes from organic customer growth and the acquisition of BBI and other tuck-in acquisitions; and an increase in state, local and other disposal fees associated with higher disposal volumes and higher taxes due to a shift in waste mix type. \n \u2022 Capital expenditures. Lower capital expenditures of $9.1 million in fiscal year 2014 related primarily to the timing of landfill development projects and a decrease in spending related to facilities.  Net cash provided by financing activities. Cash flows provided by financing activities decreased $35.9 million for fiscal year 2014 when compared to fiscal year 2013.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding $15.0 million aggregate principal amount of FAME Bonds 2015. The FAME Bonds 2015, which are unsecured and guaranteed jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally by all of our significant wholly-owned subsidiaries, accrue interest at 5.125% per annum through August 1, 2025, at which time they may be converted from a fixed to a variable rate, and interest is payable semiannually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year. An additional $15.0 million aggregate principal amount of FAME Bonds 2015 may be offered under the same indenture in the future. The FAME Bonds 2015 mature on August 1, 2035.\n \u2022 Depreciation expense increased due to: changes in our depreciable asset base as a result of the timing of various capital expenditures, including fleet upgrades and repairs and container purchases, made late in calendar year 2014, partially offset by the impact of various divestitures and asset sales, and the impairment of the asset group of CARES. \nOur cost of operations increased $31.6 million, or 0.4% as a percentage of revenues, for fiscal years 2014 when compared to fiscal year 2013.\n \u2022 Cost of operations: Cost of operations increased by $2.0 million due to: higher disposal volumes associated with organic customer growth, two new transfer station contracts and the acquisition of a solid waste hauling operation; higher equipment rental costs; higher third-party landfill disposal costs; higher operating and leachate disposal costs at certain landfills; and higher fleet maintenance costs. Increased costs were partially offset by lower diesel fuel prices, lower depletion of landfill operating lease obligations at a landfill due to a decrease in tons and a favorable rate impact associated with the annual year-end review of our landfills, lower purchased material costs and lower benefit costs. \nLoss on Derivative Instruments\n \u2022 a significant adverse change in legal status or in the business climate; \nAcquisitions and divestitures.\nIn connection with this transaction, we also sold certain of our equipment and real estate to the same third-party for total consideration of $1.1 million, resulting in a gain of $0.9 million in fiscal year 2015.\nRecycling - Transition Period 2014 compared to Unaudited Eight Month Period 2013\n \u2022 Capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were $21.6 million higher primarily due to organic business growth (including increased spending on our fleet), the installation of a gas treatment system at Juniper Ridge, various landfill development costs, and other capital investments associated with certain new contracts and a new MRF in Lewiston, Maine. \n\nWe continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows, our liquidity and our capital requirements in order to properly manage our cash needs based on the capital intensive nature of our business. Our capital requirements include fixed asset purchases (including capital expenditures for vehicles), debt servicing, landfill development and cell construction, landfill site and cell closure, as well as acquisitions. We generally meet our liquidity needs from operating cash flows and borrowings from a revolving credit facility.\n \u2022 all technical siting criteria have been met or a variance has been obtained or is reasonably expected to be obtained; \nWe use estimates to determine our provision for income taxes and related assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances have been established for the possibility that tax benefits may not be realized for certain deferred tax assets. Deferred income taxes are recognized based on the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, calculated using currently enacted tax rates. We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making this determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes.\n \u2022 The acquisitions and divestitures change component in fiscal year 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $14.4 million from the acquisition of BBI, partially offset by $7.4 million from the divestiture of Maine Energy.  Closed landfill.\n \u2022 Fuel costs decreased $0.6 million primarily due to lower diesel fuel prices in the marketplace.  Cost of Operations - Fiscal Year 2014 compared to Fiscal Year 2013\nGreenFiber. In fiscal year 2014, we and LP executed a purchase and sale agreement with a limited liability company formed by Tenex Capital Partners, L.P., pursuant to which we and LP agreed to sell our membership interests in GreenFiber for total cash consideration of $18.0 million plus an expected working capital true-up less any indebtedness and other unpaid transaction costs of GreenFiber as of the closing date. The transaction was completed for $19.2 million in gross cash proceeds, including a $1.2 million working capital adjustment. After netting indebtedness of GreenFiber and transaction costs, our 50% of the net cash proceeds amounted to $3.4 million. After considering the $0.6 million impact of our unrealized losses relating to derivative instruments in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our investment in GreenFiber, we recorded a gain on sale of equity method investment of $0.6 million in fiscal year 2014. We had previously accounted for our 50% membership interest in GreenFiber using the equity method of accounting.\n \u2022 Other amortization expense increased $1.2 million associated with an increase in our amortizable intangible assets due to acquisitions made in fiscal year 2014 and the acquisition of BBI in December 2012. \nRecycling - Fiscal Year 2015 compared to Unaudited Calendar Year 2014\nPrice.\nThe most significant items affecting the change in our financing cash flows are summarized below:\nLoss from Equity Method Investment and Gain on Sale of Equity Method Investment\nInterest Expense, net - Fiscal Year 2014 compared to Fiscal Year 2013\nIn fiscal 2013, we recorded a charge of $3.7 million for severance costs associated primarily with the realignment of our operations in order to streamline functions and improve our cost structure, the closure of Maine Energy and a reorganization of senior management. Through the realignment of our operations we improved certain aspects of the sales function to facilitate customer service and retention, pricing growth and support of strategic growth initiatives; align transportation, route management and maintenance functions at the local level; and reduce corporate overhead and staff to match organizational needs and reduce costs.\n \u2022 Increases were partially offset by the cash flow impact associated with the changes in our assets and liabilities, net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures, which are affected by both cost changes and the timing of payments. This decline is due to the unfavorable impact associated with the change in accounts payable, the unfavorable impact associated with the change in prepaid expenses, inventories and other assets and the unfavorable impact associated with the change in accounts receivable, partially offset by the favorable impact associated with the change in accrued expenses and other liabilities. \nUnder life-cycle accounting, all costs related to acquisition and construction of landfill sites are capitalized and charged to expense based on tonnage placed into each site. Landfill permitting, acquisition and preparation costs are amortized on the units-of-consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed. In determining the amortization rate for our landfills, preparation costs include the total estimated costs to complete construction of the landfills' permitted and expansion capacity.\n \u2022 The commodity price and volume change component in fiscal year 2015 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $2.0 million from unfavorable energy pricing at our landfill gas-to-energy operations, $0.4 million from unfavorable commodity pricing and $1.0 million from lower landfill gas-to-energy and processing commodity volumes.  Acquisitions and divestitures.\n \u2022 The price change component in fiscal year 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $0.6 million from favorable collection pricing, offset by $0.6 million from unfavorable disposal pricing related primarily to landfills.  Volume.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows (in millions) for the periods indicated:\n \u2022 The acquisitions and divestitures change component in fiscal year 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $2.3 million in higher collection revenues from the acquisition of various tuck-in collection operations.  Western region operating income for fiscal year 2014 decreased by $6.7 million when compared to fiscal year 2013. The change to operating income in fiscal year 2014 is primarily attributable to the following:\nFor a description of the new accounting standards that may affect us, see Note 2, Accounting Changes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAlthough inflationary increases in costs have affected our historical operating margins, we believe that inflation generally has not had a significant impact on our operating results. Consistent with industry practice, most of our contracts provide for a pass-through of certain costs to our customers, including increases in landfill tipping fees and in some cases fuel costs, intended to mitigate the impact of inflation on our operating results. We have also implemented a number of operating efficiency programs that seek to improve productivity and reduce our service costs and a fuel and oil recovery fee, which is designed to recover escalating fuel price fluctuations above an annually reset floor. Based on these implementations, we believe we should be able to sufficiently offset most cost increases resulting from inflation. However, competitive factors may require us to absorb at least a portion of these cost increases. Additionally, management's estimates associated with inflation have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities.\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings, claims and regulatory matters, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. We determine whether to disclose or accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote, reasonably possible or probable, and whether it can be reasonably estimated. We analyze our litigation and regulatory matters based on available information to assess the potential liabilities. Management's assessment is developed based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies. We accrue for loss contingencies when such amounts are probable and reasonably estimable. If a contingent liability is only reasonably possible, we will disclose the potential range of the loss, if estimable. We record losses related to contingencies in cost of operations or general and administration expenses, depending on the nature of the underlying transaction leading to the loss contingency. Contingent liabilities accounted for under purchase accounting are recorded at their fair values. These fair values may be different from the values we would have otherwise recorded, had the contingent liability not been assumed as part of an acquisition of a business. See Note 4, Business Acquisitions for disclosure over a contingent liability assumed as part of the acquisition of a business.\nWe have a dedicated business development team that identifies acquisition candidates, categorizes the opportunity by strategic fit and perceived level of financial accretion, establishes contact with the appropriate representative of the acquisition candidate and gathers further information on the acquisition candidate.\nThe table below shows, for the periods indicated, revenues (in millions) based on our operating segments:\nContract Settlement Charge\nIn calendar year 2014, eight month period 2013 and fiscal year 2014, we recorded charges of $0.4 million, $0.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively, for severance costs associated with various planned reorganization efforts including the divestiture of Maine Energy.\n \u2022 a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition; \nGeneral and administration expenses include management, clerical and administrative compensation and overhead, professional services and costs associated with marketing, sales force and community relations efforts.\n \u2022 Other: We recorded a $0.6 million gain associated with the divestiture of a business, which included the sale of certain assets associated with various waste collection routes, and a $3.8 million gain associated with the disposal of certain assets of the CARES water treatment facility and certain of our equipment and real estate in a related transaction in fiscal year 2015. In fiscal year 2014, we recorded an impairment charge of $7.5 million to the abandoned asset group of CARES.  Western Region - Transition Period 2014 compared to Unaudited Eight Month Period 2013\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities. Cash flows from operating activities increased by $12.5 million for transition period 2014 when compared to eight month period 2013.\nDiscontinued operations in eight month period 2013 and fiscal years 2014 and 2013 represent the result of operations related to the business disposition of BioFuels. In fiscal year 2014, we executed a purchase and sale agreement with ReEnergy, pursuant to which we agreed to sell certain assets of BioFuels, which is located in our Eastern region, to ReEnergy.\n \u2022 The increase in revenues for transition period 2014 is primarily the result of higher commodity volumes and the acquisition of the remaining 50% membership interest of Tompkins in December 2013. \n Cost of Operations\n \u2022 Solid waste revenues in fiscal year 2014 generated by our fuel and oil recovery fee program, which is based on a fuel index, decreased when compared to the prior fiscal year as our floating rate recovery fee declined in response to lower diesel fuel index prices on which the surcharge is based.  Commodity price and volumes.\nShelf Registration\nInvestments in unconsolidated entities over which we have significant influence over the investees' operating and financing activities are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, as applicable. Investments in affiliates in which we do not have the ability to exert significant influence over the investees' operating and financing activities are accounted for under the cost method of accounting.\nAs of January 29, 2016, we owned and/or operated 34 solid waste collection operations, 44 transfer stations, 18 recycling facilities, nine Subtitle D landfills, four landfill gas-to-energy facilities and one landfill permitted to accept C&D materials.\nOther Expenses\n \u2022 General and administration: General and administration costs increased by $2.0 million primarily due to: an increase in personnel costs, including recruitment and relocation costs, and an increase in bad debt expense primarily due to collectability issues associated with two disposal customers. \n\nOther revenues increased $11.3 million during transition period 2014 as compared to eight month period 2013 primarily as a result of higher volumes associated with organic business growth within our Customer Solutions business and, to a lesser extent, the acquisition of an industrial service management business in September 2013 and commodity volume increases within our Organics business.\n Price.\nThe fair value of each stock option is estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimation, including estimates of the expected term option holders will retain their vested stock options before exercising them and the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term.\n \u2022 Other: Other significant charges include the contract settlement charge of $1.9 million in fiscal year 2015, the reversal of $1.1 million of excess costs to complete the divestiture of Maine Energy in fiscal year 2015, the $1.0 million environmental remediation charge associated with the environmental remediation at our Southbridge landfill in calendar year 2014, severance costs associated with various planned reorganization efforts in calendar year 2014, and a $1.4 million write off of deferred costs associated with a gas pipeline development project no longer deemed to be viable in calendar year 2014. \n \u2022 Proceeds from divestiture transactions. We divested a business, certain assets of the CARES water treatment facility, and other equipment of ours as a result of the CARES transaction for cash consideration of $5.3 million in fiscal year 2015.  Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities. Cash flows from financing activities decreased $28.8 million during fiscal year 2015 when compared to calendar year 2014.\nIn addition to the financial covenants described above, the ABL Facility agreement also contains a number of important customary affirmative and negative covenants which restrict, among other things, our ability to sell assets, incur additional debt, create liens, make investments, and pay dividends. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all covenants under the ABL Facility agreement. We do not believe that these restrictions impact our ability to meet future liquidity needs.\nAccounts receivable - trade represent receivables from customers for collection, transfer, recycling, disposal and other services. Our accounts receivable - trade are recorded when billed or when related revenue is earned, if earlier, and represent claims against third-parties that will be settled in cash. The carrying value of our accounts receivable - trade, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, represents its estimated net realizable value. Estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical collection experience, current trends, credit policy and a review of our accounts receivable - trade by aging category. Our reserve is evaluated and revised on a monthly basis. Past-due accounts receivable-trade are written off when deemed to be uncollectible.\n \u2022 Fiscal year 2015 revenues decreased primarily as the result of unfavorable commodity prices in the marketplace, partially offset by higher commodity volumes and higher tipping fees. \nThe following is a summary of our operating cash flows (in millions) for fiscal year 2015 and calendar year 2014:\nChange in Fiscal Year\nRecovery of Long-Lived Assets\n \u2022 Debt activity. We issued an additional $60.0 million of 2019 Notes and refinanced our Senior Credit Facility resulting in an increase in both debt borrowings and debt payments in fiscal year 2015. In the aggregate, we were able to pay down $15.8 million, net, of long-term debt in fiscal year 2015, including the purchase for settlement of $14.7 million aggregate principal amount 2019 Notes, whereas we increased our long-term debt by $15.3M, net in calendar year 2014. \nIf an impairment indicator occurs, we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. We group our long-lived assets for this purpose at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are primarily independent of the cash flows of other assets or asset groups. If the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value.\n Solid waste revenues\nPrice.\n \u2022 Other amortization expense increased during transition period 2014 due to an increase in our intangible assets due to acquisitions made in transition period 2014 and the timing of various acquisitions made in fiscal year 2014.  Depreciation and Amortization - Fiscal Year 2014 compared to Fiscal Year 2013\nNew York Bonds\nWestern Region\nGain on Settlement of Acquisition Related Contingent Consideration\n \u2022 Direct operational costs increased $4.2 million due to: higher equipment rental costs; higher operating costs (including grounds maintenance and gas control) at certain of our landfills; and higher leachate disposal costs at certain of our landfills due to unusually high rainfall earlier in the year. These cost increases were partially offset by lower gas treatment costs at Juniper Ridge and lower depletion of landfill operating lease obligations at Southbridge and certain of our Western region landfills. \nFinal capping activities include the installation of liners, drainage, compacted soil layers and topsoil over areas of a landfill where total airspace has been consumed and waste is no longer being received. Final capping activities occur throughout the life of the landfill. Our engineering personnel estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the acreage to be capped, along with the final capping materials and activities required. The estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. The engineers then quantify the landfill capacity associated with each final capping event and the costs for each event are amortized over that capacity as waste is received at the landfill.\nOur general and administration expenses increased $4.9 million, or 0.4% as a percentage of revenues, when comparing transition period 2014 to eight month period 2013.\n \u2022 Cost of operations: Cost of operations increased by $19.1 million in fiscal year 2014 primarily due to: an increase in third-party direct costs associated with higher disposal volumes from organic customer growth and the acquisition of BBI and other operations, partially offset by a reduction of transportation costs associated with the divestiture of Maine Energy; and an increase in direct operational costs including labor, fuel, equipment rentals, landfill gas treatment costs at one of our landfills and fleet maintenance and repair costs associated with the integration of the BBI vehicle fleet, partially offset by a reduction of facility costs associated with the divestiture of Maine Energy. \nEnvironmental Remediation Liabilities\nThe change in the components of depreciation and amortization expense when comparing transition period 2014 to eight month period 2013 can primarily be attributed to the following:\n \u2022 The volume change component in fiscal year 2015 total solid waste revenues growth is primarily the result of $6.7 million from higher disposal volumes and $3.7 million from higher collection volumes. \n Price.\n \u2022 Cost of operations: Cost of operations increased by $1.8 million primarily due to: additional labor costs due to higher collection and transfer station volumes associated with new municipal contracts and organic customer growth; higher operating costs at one of our landfills; and higher facility and fleet maintenance costs. These costs were partially offset by lower diesel fuel prices, lower gas treatment costs at Juniper Ridge, lower operating costs associated with our Worcester landfill closing and the expiration of an out-of-market put-or-pay waste disposal contract. \nNet cash flows provided by operating activities. Cash flows provided by operating activities increased by $5.7 million for fiscal year 2014 when compared to fiscal year 2013.\n \u2022 The commodity price and volume change component in transition period 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is primarily the result of lower power generation and processing commodity volumes. \nInterest Expense, net - Transition Period 2014 compared to Unaudited Eight Month Period 2013\n \u2022 Cost of operations: Cost of operations increased by $6.0 million due to: an increase in third-party direct costs associated with higher hauling costs driven by transfer station volume growth (including the addition of new operating contracts for municipality-owned transfer stations) and landfill volume growth, partially offset by lower disposal costs driven by the winding down of business at CARES and lower collection volumes; an increase in other operational costs, including healthcare, depletion of landfill operating lease obligations (due to increased landfill volumes), host community fees and royalties fees, and maintenance costs associated with our fleet, hauling facilities and landfill facilities. These costs were partially offset by decreased fuel costs associated with lower diesel fuel prices in the marketplace. \nSelf-Insurance Liabilities and Related Costs\n \u2022 Improved operational performance in fiscal year 2014 as revenues increased by $42.3 million, whereas cost of operations and general and administration costs increased only $35.3 million and remained consistent as a percentage of revenues. \n \u2022 The price change component in fiscal year 2015 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $8.9 million from favorable collection pricing and $1.6 million from favorable disposal pricing associated primarily with our landfills and transfer stations.  Volume.\n \u2022 Fuel costs decreased $6.0 million due to lower diesel fuel prices in the marketplace. The favorable impact associated with lower diesel fuel prices was more than offset by interrelated higher recycling tipping fees, lower fuel and oil recovery fees, lower recycling commodity pricing and lower energy pricing revenues during fiscal year 2015.  Cost of Operations - Transition Period 2014 compared to Unaudited Eight Month Period 2013\nCost of operations includes labor costs, tipping fees paid to third-party disposal facilities, fuel costs, maintenance and repair costs of vehicles and equipment, workers' compensation and vehicle insurance costs, the cost of purchasing materials to be recycled, third-party transportation costs, district and state taxes, host community fees and royalties. Cost of operations also includes accretion expense related to final capping, closure and post-closure obligations, leachate treatment and disposal costs and depletion of landfill operating lease obligations.\nThe following table provides details associated with the period-to-period change in revenues (dollars in millions) attributable to services provided:\nOur interest expense, net increased $2.0 million in fiscal year 2015 as compared to calendar year 2014 due to higher average debt balances combined with changes to our capitalization structure associated with various tax exempt debt borrowings, the issuance of additional 2019 Notes and the refinancing of our Senior Credit Facility. In fiscal year 2015, we also experienced interest savings when we repurchased and permanently retired $14.7 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes, our most expensive debt, at a weighted average repurchase price of $101.0.\n\nIf the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value for a reporting unit, an impairment charge would be recorded to earnings. The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. After a goodwill impairment loss is recognized, the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill becomes its new accounting basis.\nOther - Fiscal Year 2014 compared to Fiscal Year 2013\nIn fiscal year 2015, we issued an additional $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes. The additional 2019 Notes, which are both fungible and issued under the same indenture as the $325.0 million 2019 Notes previously issued, were issued at a discount of $0.5 million to be accreted over the remaining term of the 2019 Notes. We used the net proceeds from this issuance, together with the initial borrowings under our new ABL Facility, to refinance our Senior Credit Facility. Additionally, in fiscal year 2015, we repurchased and permanently retired $14.7 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes at a weighted average repurchase price of $101.0 in order to maximize interest savings by paying down our most expensive debt.\n \u2022 Payments of financing costs. We had a $6.4 million increase in deferred financing cost payments in fiscal year 2015 related primarily to the issuance of an additional $60.0 million of 2019 Notes and $15.0 million of Finance Authority of Maine Solid Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds Series 2015 (\u201cFAME Bonds 2015\u201d) and the refinancing of our Senior Credit Facility. \n (1) Based on debt and capital lease balances as of December 31, 2015. Interest obligations related to variable rate debt were calculated using variable rates in effect at December 31, 2015. \n \u2022 Third-party direct costs increased $0.2 million due to: higher collection and disposal volumes from organic customer growth, including various new contracts, and various acquisitions; and higher commodity volumes in the Recycling segment. These cost increases were offset by lower purchased material costs associated with declining commodity prices within the Recycling segment; lower purchased material costs in our Customer Solutions business; and the expiration of an out-of-market put-or-pay waste disposal contract in the Eastern region. \nPrior to these transactions, we recorded income from equity method investments of $0.1 million in calendar year 2014 and losses from our equity method investments of $1.0 million, $0.9 million and $4.4 million in eight month period 2013, fiscal year 2014 and fiscal year 2013.\n \u2022 Professional fees increased $0.9 million due to: accounting and auditing services associated with the change in fiscal year-end; higher legal costs associated with third-party legal advice, including a legal settlement with the New York Attorney General; and a loss accrued for a potential legal settlement with the MADEP. See discussion in Part I, Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nDivestitures\n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization: Depreciation and amortization costs increased $1.4 million in fiscal year 2014 due to the following: an increase in landfill amortization costs associated with higher landfill volumes; an increase in estimated costs associated with our Worcester landfill in closure status; and depreciation expense savings associated with the divestiture of Maine Energy. \nTo determine fair value, we use discounted cash flow analyses and estimates about the future cash flows of the asset or asset group. This analysis includes a determination of an appropriate discount rate, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates. The cash flows employed in our discounted cash flow analyses are typically based on financial forecasts developed internally by management. The discount rate used is commensurate with the risks involved. We may also rely on third-party valuations and or information available regarding the market value for similar assets.\n Price.\nSolid waste revenues\n \u2022 Depreciation expense decreased $1.0 million due to the divestiture of Maine Energy in the third quarter of fiscal year 2013, which reduced our depreciable asset base for all of fiscal year 2014. \nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nPursuant to Section 2.19 of the indenture governing the 2019 Notes and the provisions of the FAME Bonds 2015, FAME Bonds 2005R-2, New Hampshire Bonds, New York Bonds and Vermont Bonds, no beneficial holder of the 2019 Notes, FAME Bonds 2015, FAME Bonds 2005R-2, New Hampshire Bonds, New York Bonds and/or Vermont Bonds is permitted to knowingly acquire 2019 Notes, FAME Bonds 2015, FAME Bonds 2005R-2, New Hampshire Bonds, New York Bonds and/or Vermont Bonds if such person would own 10% or more of the consolidated debt for which relevant subsidiaries of ours are obligated (and must dispose of 2019 Notes, FAME Bonds 2015, FAME Bonds 2005R-2, New Hampshire Bonds, New York Bonds and/or Vermont Bonds or other debt of ours to the extent such person becomes aware of exceeding such threshold), if such ownership would require consent of any regulatory authority under applicable law or regulation governing solid waste operators and such consent has not been obtained. We will furnish to the holders of the 2019 Notes, FAME Bonds 2015, FAME Bonds 2005R-2, New Hampshire Bonds, New York Bonds and Vermont Bonds, in each quarterly and annual report, the dollar amount of our debt that would serve as the threshold for evaluating a beneficial holder's compliance with these ownership restrictions. As of December 31, 2015, that dollar amount was $51.6 million.\nThe following table provides details associated with the period-to-period change in revenues (dollars in millions) attributable to services provided:\nWe no longer account for our investment in Tompkins using the equity method of accounting and began including the accounts of Tompkins in our consolidated financial statements.\nGeneral and Administration - Fiscal Year 2015 compared to Unaudited Calendar Year 2014\n \u2022 Labor and related benefit costs increased $2.3 million due to: the acquisition of BBI; processing higher volumes of commodities through our Recycling segment; and lower productivity as a result of prolonged inclement winter weather. \n \u2022 Proceeds from the sale of equity method investment. During eight month period 2013, we and LP sold our membership interests in GreenFiber. After netting indebtedness of GreenFiber and transaction costs, our 50% of the net cash proceeds amounted to $2.8 million. \nIn addition to an annual goodwill impairment assessment, we would evaluate a reporting unit for impairment if events or circumstances change between annual tests indicating a possible impairment. Examples of such events or circumstances include the following:\nIntangible assets consist primarily of covenants not-to-compete and customer lists. Intangible assets are recorded at fair value and are amortized based on the economic benefit provided or using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Covenants not-to-compete and customer lists are typically amortized over a term of no more than 10 years.\n \u2022 The fuel and oil recovery fee change component in fiscal year 2015 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of lower revenues generated by our fuel and oil recovery fee program in response to lower diesel fuel index prices on which the surcharge is based.  Organics revenues\n \u2022 The acquisitions and divestitures change component in transition period 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of various solid waste hauling operation acquisitions completed between August 2013 and September 2014.  Western region operating income increased $1.6 million during transition period 2014 as compared to eight month period 2013. The change in operating income is primarily attributable to the solid waste revenues growth discussed above combined with the following cost changes:\nCash Flow Activity - Fiscal Year 2014 compared to Fiscal Year 2013\nIn addition to the above obligations, we have unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2015 of approximately $0.4 million. Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with the unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2015, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates as to the timing of cash settlements. For a description of our commitments and contingencies, see Note 8, Final Capping, Closure and Post-Closure Costs, Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies and Note 14, Income Taxes, of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWestern Region - Fiscal Year 2015 compared to Unaudited Calendar Year 2014\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \u2022 The volume change component in fiscal year 2015 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of $10.7 million from higher disposal volumes (of which $5.0 million relates to higher landfill volumes, $4.9 million relates to higher transportation volumes and $0.8 million relates to higher transfer station volumes associated with two new transfer station contracts), partially offset by $2.3 million from lower processing volumes and $2.3 million from lower collection volumes.  Fuel and oil recovery fee.\nOur interest expense, net increased $0.2 million in transition period 2014 as compared to eight month period 2013 as interest expense associated with higher average debt balances in transition period 2014 was partially offset by interest savings associated with a reduction to our outstanding letters of credit.\n \u2022 we are actively working on obtaining any necessary permits and we expect that all required permits will be received; and \n \u2022 Acquisitions, net of cash acquired. During fiscal year 2014, we acquired various businesses including several solid waste hauling operations, a transfer station, a MRF and an industrial service management business (included in the Other segment) for total consideration of $10.1 million, of which we have made $8.5 million in cash payments. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, we recovered $0.2 million of the purchase price holdback amount we had previously paid and were relieved of any potential contingent consideration obligation associated with the acquisition of an industrial service management business in fiscal year 2014. This is compared to fiscal year 2013, when we acquired six solid waste hauling operations in the Western region and acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of BBI in the Eastern region for total consideration of $28.0 million, of which we paid $24.8 million in cash and made $0.5 million in holdback payments in fiscal year 2013. \nIn the fiscal year ended April 30, 2012, we entered into two forward starting interest rate derivative agreements that were initially being used to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the forecasted financing transaction to redeem our Second Lien Notes. The total notional amount of these agreements was $150.0 million and required us to receive interest based on changes in LIBOR and pay interest at a rate of approximately 1.40%. During fiscal year 2013, we dedesignated both of the $75.0 million forward starting interest rate derivative agreements and discontinued hedge accounting in accordance with FASB ASC 815-30 because the interest payments associated with the forecasted financing transaction were no longer deemed probable. We recognized a $3.6 million loss, reclassified\nIn fiscal year 2015, we recorded a contract settlement charge of $1.9 million associated with the Expera Old Town, LLC v. Casella Waste Systems, Inc. legal matter. See Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further disclosure.\nIn each of transition period 2014 and calendar year 2014, we recorded an environmental remediation charge of $1.0 million associated with remediation performed at our Southbridge landfill in the Eastern region. We had previously recorded an environmental remediation charge of $0.4 million in eight month period 2013 and fiscal year 2014 associated with remediating this site.\n \u2022 The fuel and oil recovery fee change component in fiscal year 2014 total solid waste revenues growth is the result of lower revenues being generated by our fuel and oil recovery fee program in response to lower diesel fuel index prices on which the surcharge is based.  Organics revenues\nVolume.\nSee Note 14, Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further disclosure.\nThe change in the components of depreciation and amortization expense when comparing fiscal year 2014 to fiscal year 2013 can primarily be attributed to the following:\nOther operating income decreased by $1.7 million during transition period 2014 when compared to eight month period 2013 as increased revenues were more than offset by increased third-party direct costs (including hauling and purchased material costs associated primarily with our Customer Solutions business and, to a lesser extent, hauling costs associated with our Organics business) and labor and related benefit costs associated with growth in our Customer Solutions business.", "item_7_tables": "Table 200: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td>

the key points from the MD&A report:\n\n- Revenues increased in fiscal year 2015 compared to calendar year 2014 due to higher volumes from organic business growth, partially offset by lower commodity prices. Costs increased at a lower rate than revenues.\n\n- Net income improved in fiscal year 2015 compared to calendar year 2014 due to revenue growth and cost control. \n\n- Cash flows from operations increased in fiscal year 2015 compared to calendar year 2014 due to improved profitability.\n\n- The company has high debt levels but was in compliance with debt covenants as of December 31, 2015. Debt was refinanced during 2015 at more favorable rates. \n\n- Capital expenditures were lower in 2015 than 2014 due to timing of landfill development projects.\n\n- The company operates solid waste collection, disposal, recycling and organics services in the northeastern U.S. \n\n- Key drivers are economic conditions, pricing, volume, commodity prices, acquisitions and divestitures, fuel costs, and asset impairments.\n\nIn summary, the company improved profitability in 2015 through revenue growth and cost control. Debt was refinanced at more favorable rates. The company continues to invest in the business while managing debt levels. Performance is tied to broader economic conditions and industry factors like pricing, volumes and commodity prices."}
