Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIntroduction\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of The Wendy's Company ( The Wendy's Company\u201d and, together with its subsidiaries, the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d or our\u201d) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere within this report. Certain statements we make under this Item 7 constitute forward-looking statements\u201d under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Projections\u201d in Part I\u201d preceding Item 1 - Business.\u201d You should consider our forward-looking statements in light of the risks discussed under the heading Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A above, as well as our consolidated financial statements, related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe Wendy's Company is the parent company of its 100% owned subsidiary holding company, Wendy's Restaurants, LLC ( Wendy's Restaurants\u201d). The principal 100% owned subsidiary of Wendy's Restaurants is Wendy's International, LLC and its subsidiaries ( Wendy's\u201d). Wendy's franchises and operates Wendy's\u00ae quick-service restaurants specializing in hamburger sandwiches throughout North America (defined as the United States of America (the U.S.\u201d) and Canada). Wendy's also has franchised restaurants in 29 foreign countries and U.S. territories.\nThe Company manages and internally reports its business geographically. The operation and franchising of Wendy's restaurants in North America comprises virtually all of our current operations and represents a single reportable segment. The revenues and operating results of Wendy's restaurants outside of North America are not material. The results of operations discussed below may not necessarily be indicative of future results.\nThe Company's fiscal reporting periods consist of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Sunday closest to December 31 and are referred to herein as (1) the year ended January 1, 2017\u201d or 2016,\u201d which consisted of 52 weeks, (2) the year ended January 3, 2016\u201d or 2015,\u201d which consisted of 53 weeks, and (3) the year ended December 28, 2014\u201d or 2014,\u201d which consisted of 52 weeks. All references to years and quarters relate to fiscal periods rather than calendar periods.\nExecutive Overview\nOur Continuing Business\nAs of January 1, 2017, the Wendy's restaurant system was comprised of 6,537 restaurants, of which 330 were owned and operated by the Company. All of our Company-operated restaurants are located in the U.S. as a result of the Company completing its initiative during the second quarter of 2015 to sell all Company-operated restaurants in Canada to franchisees.\nWendy's operating results are impacted by a number of external factors, including unemployment, general economic trends, intense price competition, commodity costs, labor costs and weather.\nWendy's long-term growth opportunities will be driven by a combination of brand relevance and economic relevance. Key components of growth include (1) systemwide same-restaurant sales growth through continuing core menu improvement, product innovation and customer count growth, (2) investing in our Image Activation program, which includes innovative exterior and interior restaurant designs for our new and reimaged restaurants and focused execution of operational excellence, (3) growth in new restaurants, including global growth, (4) increased restaurant utilization in various dayparts and brand access utilizing mobile technology, (5) building shareholder value through financial management strategies and (6) our system optimization initiative.\nWendy's revenues for 2016 include: (1) $920.8 million of sales at Company-operated restaurants, (2) $371.5 million of royalty revenue and fees and (3) $143.1 million of franchise rental income. In 2016, substantially all of our Wendy's royalty agreements provided for royalties of 4.0% of franchise revenues.\nKey Business Measures\nWe track our results of operations and manage our business using the following key business measures, which include non-GAAP financial measures:\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Same-Restaurant Sales - Beginning with the first quarter of 2016, the Company revised its reporting methodology for same-restaurant sales to simplify the reporting of its same-restaurant sales performance for reimaged restaurants and to better align with restaurant-industry practice. Under the new methodology, the Company includes restaurants in its comparable sales base as soon as reimaged restaurants reopen (the New Method\u201d). Reimaged restaurants previously entered the comparable sales base after they had been open for three continuous months (the Old Method\u201d). There was no change in the reporting methodology for new restaurants, which will continue to be excluded from same-restaurant sales until they have been open for 15 continuous months. The table summarizing the results of operations provides the same-restaurant sales percent change using the New Method, as well as the Old Method. The New Method is consistent with the metric used by our management for internal reporting and analysis. Same-restaurant sales exclude the impact of currency translation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Restaurant Margin - We define restaurant margin as sales from Company-operated restaurants less cost of sales divided by sales from Company-operated restaurants. Cost of sales includes food and paper, restaurant labor and occupancy, advertising and other operating costs. Restaurant margin is influenced by factors such as restaurant openings and closures, price increases, the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing initiatives, featured products, product mix, the level of our fixed and semi-variable costs and fluctuations in food and labor costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Systemwide Sales - Systemwide sales is a non-GAAP financial measure, which includes sales by both Company-operated restaurants and franchised restaurants. Franchised restaurants' sales are reported by our franchisees and represent their revenues from sales at franchised Wendy's restaurants. The Company's consolidated financial statements do not include sales by franchised restaurants to their customers. The Company believes systemwide sales data is useful in assessing consumer demand for the Company's products, the overall success of the Wendy's brand and, ultimately, the performance of the Company. The Company's royalty revenues are computed as percentages of sales made by Wendy's franchisees. As a result, sales by Wendy's franchisees have a direct effect on the Company's royalty revenues and therefore on the Company's profitability.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The Company reviews systemwide sales for its international franchised restaurants on a constant currency basis. Constant currency results exclude the impact of foreign currency translation and are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. The Company believes excluding the impact of foreign currency translation provides better year over year comparability.\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Average Unit Volumes - We calculate Company-operated restaurant average unit volumes by summing the average weekly sales of all Company-operated restaurants which reported sales during the week.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Franchised restaurant average unit volumes is a non-GAAP financial measure, which includes sales by franchised restaurants, which are reported by our franchisees and represent their revenues from sales at franchised Wendy's restaurants. The Company's consolidated financial statements do not include sales by franchised restaurants to their customers. The Company believes franchised restaurant average unit volumes is useful information for the same reasons described above for Systemwide Sales.\u201d We calculate franchised restaurant average unit volumes by summing the average weekly sales of all franchised restaurants which reported sales during the week.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures discussed above do not replace the presentation of the Company's financial results in accordance with GAAP. Because all companies do not calculate non-GAAP financial measures in the same way, these measures as used by other companies may not be consistent with the way the Company calculates such measures.\nSystem Optimization Initiative\nIn July 2013, the Company announced a system optimization initiative, as part of its brand transformation, which includes a shift from Company-operated restaurants to franchised restaurants over time, through acquisitions and dispositions, as well as helping to facilitate franchisee-to-franchisee restaurant transfers. In February 2015, the Company announced plans to sell approximately 540 additional restaurants to franchisees and reduce its ongoing Company-operated restaurant ownership to approximately 5% of the total system by the end of 2016. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company completed the sale of 310,\n327 and 255 Company-operated restaurants to franchisees, respectively, which included the sale of all of its Company-operated restaurants in Canada. The Company recognized net gains totaling $71.9 million, $74.0 million and $91.5 million on the sale of Company-operated restaurants and other assets during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which were recorded to System optimization gains, net\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations. In addition, the Company facilitated the transfer of 144 and 71 restaurants between franchisees during 2016 and 2015, respectively. With the sale of 310 restaurants during 2016, the Company completed its plan to reduce its Company-operated restaurant ownership to approximately 5% as of January 1, 2017. Wendy's will continue to optimize its system by facilitating franchisee-to-franchisee transfers of restaurants, as well as evaluating strategic acquisitions of franchised restaurants and strategic dispositions of Company-operated restaurants to existing and new franchisees, to further strengthen the franchisee base, drive new restaurant development and accelerate Image Activation adoption.\nCosts related to our system optimization initiative are recorded to Reorganization and realignment costs.\u201d During 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company recognized costs totaling $9.4 million, $11.6 million and $19.0 million, respectively, which primarily included severance and related employee costs, accelerated depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense and professional fees. The Company expects to incur additional costs, primarily comprised of professional fees, of approximately $1.3 million during 2017 in connection with an in-process transaction as of January 1, 2017. Costs incurred during 2017 related to facilitating franchisee-to-franchisee transfers of restaurants will be recorded to Other operating income, net.\u201d\nGeneral and Administrative ( G&A\u201d) Realignment\nIn November 2014, the Company initiated a plan to reduce its general and administrative expenses. The plan included a realignment and reinvestment of resources to focus primarily on accelerated restaurant development and consumer-facing restaurant technology to drive long-term growth. The Company achieved the majority of the expense reductions through the realignment of its U.S. field operations and savings at its Restaurant Support Center in Dublin, Ohio, which was substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of 2015. Costs related to G&A realignment are recorded to Reorganization and realignment costs.\u201d The Company recognized costs totaling $0.7 million, $10.3 million and $12.9 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which primarily included severance and related employee costs, share-based compensation and recruitment and relocation costs. No additional costs are expected to be incurred under the G&A realignment plan.\nSecuritized Financing Facility\nOn June 1, 2015, the Company completed a $2,275.0 million securitized financing facility, which consists of the following: $875.0 million of 3.371%, $900.0 million of 4.080% and $500.0 million of 4.497% Series 2015-1 fixed rate senior secured notes (collectively, the Series 2015-1 Class A-2 Notes\u201d). In addition, the Company entered into a purchase agreement for the issuance of Series 2015-1 variable funding senior secured notes, Class A-1 (the Series 2015-1 Class A-1 Notes\u201d and, together with the Series 2015-1 Class A-2 Notes, the Series 2015-1 Senior Notes\u201d), which allows for the issuance of up to $150.0 million of variable funding notes and certain other credit instruments, including letters of credit. The proceeds from the issuance of the Series 2015-1 Class A-2 Notes, were used to repay all amounts outstanding on the Term A Loans and Term B Loans under the Company's May 16, 2013 Restated Credit Agreement amended on September 24, 2013 (the 2013 Restated Credit Agreement\u201d). In connection with the repayment of the Term A Loans and Term B Loans, the Company terminated the related interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $350.0 million and $100.0 million, respectively, which had been designated as cash flow hedges. As a result, the Company recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $7.3 million during the second quarter of 2015, primarily consisting of the write-off of deferred costs related to the 2013 Restated Credit Agreement of $7.2 million and fees paid to terminate the related interest rate swaps of $0.1 million.\nSale of the Bakery\nOn May 31, 2015, Wendy's completed the sale of 100% of its membership interest in The New Bakery Company, LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Bakery\u201d) to East Balt US, LLC (the Buyer\u201d) for $78.5 million in cash (subject to customary purchase price adjustments). The Company recorded a pre-tax gain on the disposal of the Bakery of $25.5 million during 2015, which included transaction closing costs and a reduction of goodwill. The Company recognized income tax expense associated with the gain on disposal of $14.9 million during 2015, which included the impact of the disposal of non-deductible goodwill. In conjunction with the Bakery sale, Wendy's entered into a transition services agreement with the Buyer, pursuant to which Wendy's provided certain continuing corporate and shared services to the Buyer through March 31, 2016 for no additional consideration. The Bakery's results of operations and the gain on disposal have been included in discontinued operations.\nSale of Arby's\nOn July 4, 2011, Wendy's Restaurants completed the sale of 100% of the common stock of its then wholly-owned subsidiary, Arby's Restaurant Group, Inc. ( Arby's\u201d) to ARG IH Corporation ( ARG\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ARG Holding Corporation ( ARG Parent\u201d), for $130.0 million in cash (subject to customary purchase price adjustments) and 18.5% of the common stock of ARG Parent (through which Wendy's Restaurants indirectly retained an 18.5% interest in Arby's). The Company received a $54.9 million dividend from our investment in Arby's in 2015, which was recognized in Investment income, net.\u201d\nRelated Party Transactions\nStock Purchase Agreement\nOn June 2, 2015, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement to repurchase our common stock from Nelson Peltz, Peter W. May (Messrs. Peltz and May are members of the Company's Board of Directors) and Edward P. Garden (who served on the Company's Board of Directors until December 14, 2015) and certain of their family members and affiliates, investment funds managed by Trian Fund Management, L.P. (an investment management firm controlled by Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden, TFM\u201d) and the general partner of certain of those funds (together with Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden, certain of their family members and affiliates and TFM, the Trian Group\u201d), who in the aggregate owned approximately 24.8% of the Company's outstanding shares as of May 29, 2015. Pursuant to the agreement, the Trian Group agreed not to tender or sell any of its shares in the modified Dutch auction tender offer the Company commenced on June 3, 2015. Also pursuant to the agreement, the Company agreed, following completion of the tender offer, to purchase from the Trian Group a pro rata amount of its shares based on the number of shares the Company purchased in the tender offer, at the same price received by shareholders who participated in the tender offer. On July 17, 2015, after completion of the modified Dutch auction tender offer, the Company repurchased 18.4 million shares of its common stock from the Trian Group at the price paid in the tender offer of $11.45 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $210.9 million.\nSupply Chain Relationship Agreement\nWendy's has a purchasing co-op relationship agreement (the Wendy's Co-op\u201d) with its franchisees which establishes Quality Supply Chain Co-op, Inc. ( QSCC\u201d). QSCC manages, for the Wendy's system in the U.S. and Canada, contracts for the purchase and distribution of food, proprietary paper, operating supplies and equipment under national agreements with pricing based upon total system volume. QSCC's supply chain management facilitates continuity of supply and provides consolidated purchasing efficiencies while monitoring and seeking to minimize possible obsolete inventory throughout the Wendy's supply chain in the U.S. and Canada.\nWendy's and its franchisees pay sourcing fees to third-party vendors on certain products sourced by QSCC. Such sourcing fees are remitted by these vendors to QSCC and are the primary means of funding QSCC's operations. Should QSCC's sourcing fees exceed its expected needs, QSCC's board of directors may return some or all of the excess to its members in the form of a patronage dividend. Wendy's recorded its share of patronage dividends of $0.9 million, $1.3 million and $1.5 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which are included as a reduction of Cost of sales.\u201d\nEffective January 1, 2011, Wendy's leased 14,333 square feet of office space to QSCC for an annual base rental of $0.2 million. The lease expired on December 31, 2016. A new lease agreement was signed effective January 1, 2017, expiring on December 31, 2020 for an annual base rental of $0.2 million. The Wendy's Company received $0.2 million of lease income from QSCC each year during 2016, 2015 and 2014, which has been recorded as a reduction of General and administrative.\u201d\nCitationAir Aircraft Lease Agreement\nThe Wendy's Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, was party to a three-year aircraft management and lease agreement, which expired in March 2014, with CitationAir, a subsidiary of Cessna Aircraft Company, pursuant to which the Company leased a corporate aircraft to CitationAir to use as part of its Jet Card program fleet. During the first quarter of 2014, our Chairman, who was our former Chief Executive Officer, and our Vice Chairman, who was our former President and Chief Operating Officer (the Former Executives\u201d) and a director, who was our former Vice Chairman, and members of their immediate families, used their Jet Card agreements for business and personal travel on aircraft in the Jet Card program fleet. A management company formed by the Former Executives and a director (the Management Company\u201d) paid CitationAir directly, and the Company received credit from CitationAir for charges related to such travel of approximately $0.4 million during 2014.\nTimWen lease and management fee payments\nA wholly-owned subsidiary of Wendy's leases restaurant facilities from TimWen for the operation of Wendy's/Tim Hortons combo units in Canada. Prior to the second quarter of 2015, Wendy's operated certain of the Wendy's/Tim Hortons combo units in Canada and subleased some of the restaurant facilities to franchisees. As a result of the Company completing its plan to sell all of its Company-operated restaurants in Canada to franchisees during the second quarter of 2015, all of the restaurant facilities are subleased to franchisees. Wendy's paid TimWen $11.8 million, $12.1 million and $6.3 million under these lease agreements during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, TimWen paid Wendy's a management fee under the TimWen joint venture agreement of $0.2 million each year during 2016, 2015 and 2014, which has been included as a reduction to General and administrative.\u201d\nFranchisee Incentive Programs\nFranchisee Image Activation Incentive Programs\nIn order to promote Image Activation new restaurant development, Wendy's has an incentive program for franchisees that provides for reductions in royalty and national advertising payments for up to the first two years of operation for qualifying new restaurants opened by December 31, 2020, with the value of the incentives declining in the later years of the program. Wendy's also has incentive programs for 2017 available to franchisees that commence Image Activation restaurant remodels by December 15, 2017. The remodel incentive programs provide for reductions in royalty payments for one year after the completion of construction.\nIn addition, Wendy's had incentive programs that included reductions in royalty payments in 2016, 2015 and 2014 as well as cash incentives for franchisees' participation in Wendy's Image Activation program throughout 2014. The Company recognized expense of $4.4 million for cash incentives in General and administrative\u201d during 2014.\nFranchisee Image Activation Financing Program\nWendy's executed an agreement in 2013 to partner with a third-party lender to establish a financing program for franchisees that participate in our Image Activation program. Under the program, the lender agreed to provide loans to franchisees to be used for the reimaging of restaurants according to the guidelines and specifications under Wendy's Image Activation program. To support the program, Wendy's provided to the lender a $6.0 million irrevocable stand-by letter of credit, which was issued on July 1, 2013 and was cash collateralized. During 2016, the Company executed an agreement to terminate the letter of credit agreement that had been previously executed as part of the financing program.\nCybersecurity Incident\nThe Company first reported unusual payment card activity affecting some franchise-owned restaurants in February 2016 and that malware had been discovered on certain systems. Subsequently, on June 9, 2016, the Company reported that an additional malware variant had been identified and disabled. On July 7, 2016, the Company, on behalf of affected franchise locations, provided information about specific restaurant locations that may have been impacted by these attacks, all of which are located in the United States, along with support for customers who may have been affected by the malware variants. See Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nResults of Operations\nAs a result of the sale of the Bakery discussed above in Executive Overview - Sale of the Bakery,\u201d the Bakery's results of operations for the period from December 29, 2014 through May 31, 2015 and for the year ended 2014 have been included in Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes\u201d in the table below.\nThe tables included throughout Results of Operations set forth in millions the Company's consolidated results of operations for the years ended January 1, 2017, January 3, 2016 and December 28, 2014 (except average unit volumes, which are in thousands).\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>

decrease in sales during 2016 was primarily due to the impact of Wendy's Company-operated restaurants sold under our system optimization initiative, which resulted in a reduction in sales of $560.0 million. In addition, 2016 included one less week of sales when compared to 2015, which resulted in a reduction in sales of $19.2 million. Company-operated same-restaurant sales during 2016 increased 2.7% primarily due to an increase in customer count. Sales also benefited from higher sales growth at our new and remodeled Image Activation restaurants.\nThe decrease in sales during 2015 was primarily due to the impact of Wendy's Company-operated restaurants sold under our system optimization initiative, which resulted in a reduction in sales of $271.0 million. This decrease in sales was partially offset by sales during the 53rd week of 2015 of $19.2 million, which were excluded from same-restaurant sales, and sales from restaurants acquired of $36.9 million. Company-operated same-restaurant sales during 2015 increased due to an increase in our average per customer check amount, which reflects benefits from strategic price increases on our menu items and changes in product mix. Same-restaurant sales also benefited from higher sales growth at our new and remodeled Image Activation restaurants and a slight\nincrease in customer count. The customer count increase for the year was driven by significantly higher customer transactions during the fourth quarter of 2015, which resulted in a Company-operated same-restaurant sales increase of 3.7% during the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Sales during 2015 were negatively impacted by $7.4 million due to changes in Canadian foreign currency rates relative to the U.S. dollar.\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Franchise Royalty Revenue and Fees\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Royalty revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Franchise fees\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in franchise royalty revenue and fees during 2016 was primarily due to sales of Company-operated restaurants to franchisees and facilitating franchisee-to-franchisee restaurant transfers under our system optimization initiative. Royalty revenue also benefited from a 1.4% increase in franchise same-restaurant sales. These increases were partially offset by royalty revenue of approximately $6.0 million for the 53rd week of 2015.\nThe increase in franchise royalty revenue and fees during 2015 was primarily due to sales of Company-operated restaurants to franchisees and facilitating franchisee-to-franchisee restaurant transfers under our system optimization initiative. Royalty revenue was also positively impacted by an increase in franchise same-restaurant sales, which excludes sales during the 53rd week of 2015. We believe franchise same-restaurant sales were higher than Company-operated same-restaurant sales during 2015 due to higher price increases. Royalty revenue also includes approximately $6.0 million for the 53rd week of 2015.\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Franchise Rental Income\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Franchise rental income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in franchise rental income during 2016 and 2015 was primarily due to leasing and/or subleasing properties to franchisees in connection with the sale of Company-operated restaurants and facilitating franchisee-to-franchisee restaurant transfers.\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of Sales, as a Percent of Sales\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Food and paper\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restaurant labor\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Occupancy, advertising and other operating costs\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe improvement in cost of sales, as a percent of sales, during 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in commodity costs, reflecting lower beef prices. In addition, the increase in same-restaurant sales and higher sales at our new and remodeled Image Activation restaurants contributed to the improvement in cost of sales, as a percent of sales. These decreases in cost of sales, as a percent of sales, were partially offset by (1) higher medical insurance costs, (2) increased labor rates and (3) the negative impact of changes in product mix.\nThe decrease in cost of sales, as a percent of sales, during 2015 was due to benefits from strategic price increases on our menu items and higher sales at our Image Activation restaurants. As a percent of sales, commodity costs were flat compared with prior year, as higher beef prices were offset by lower prices of other commodities.

The securitized financing facility includes the Series 2015-1 Class A-2 Notes, which are comprised of fixed interest rate notes, and the Series 2015-1 Class A-1 Notes, which allow for the issuance up to $150.0 million of variable funding notes. The principal amounts outstanding on the Series 2015-1 Class A-2 Notes significantly exceed the amounts that were outstanding on the Term A Loans and Term B Loans. In addition, the Series 2015-1 Class A-2 Notes bear fixed-rate interest at rates higher than our historical effective interest rates on our variable interest rate Term A Loans and Term B Loans. Interest expense also increased during 2016 due to an increase in capital lease obligations resulting from facilitating franchisee-to-franchisee restaurant transfers and subleasing such properties to the franchisee.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt\nDuring 2015, the Company incurred a loss on the early extinguishment of debt as a result of repaying all amounts outstanding on the Term A Loans and Term B Loans under the 2013 Restated Credit Agreement, with the proceeds from its securitized financing facility. The loss on the early extinguishment of debt was primarily comprised of the write-off of deferred costs associated with the 2013 Restated Credit Agreement of $7.2 million and fees paid to terminate the related interest rate swaps of $0.1 million.\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Income, Net\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions, including dividends\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(54.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of investments, net\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other than temporary loss on investment\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(51.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in distributions, including dividends in 2016 was primarily a result of a $54.9 million dividend we received in 2015 from our investment in Arby's.\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for Income Taxes\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from continuing operations before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>201.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>234.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>192.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>72.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate on income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>35.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur effective tax rates in 2016, 2015, and 2014 were impacted by variations in income from continuing operations before income taxes, adjusted for recurring items such as non-deductible expenses and state income taxes, as well as non-recurring discrete items. Discrete items, which may occur in any given year but are not consistent from year to year include the following: (1) the impact of our system optimization initiative further described below, (2) valuation allowances which decreased in 2016 and increased in 2015 and 2014 primarily as a result of changes in expected future state taxable income available to offset certain state net operating loss carryforwards (including a correction to a prior year identified and recorded in the first quarter of 2016, which resulted in a benefit of $2.9 million) and (3) a deduction for a dividend received in 2015 from our investment in Arby's.\nThe impact of our system optimization initiative on the provision for income taxes included the effects of the disposition of non-deductible goodwill (including a correction to a prior year identified and recorded in the first quarter of 2016, which resulted in a benefit of $4.2 million), and changes to our state deferred taxes and valuation allowances on state net operating losses caused\nby the shifting relative taxable presence in the various states as our system optimization initiative was executed. These items, which are non-recurring, increased tax expense by $2.8 million, $15.1 million and $9.5 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nDeferred income taxes are not recorded for temporary differences related to our investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries which we consider permanently invested outside of the U.S. At January 1, 2017, our cash balances held outside of the U.S. totaled $97.8 million.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2017, our effective tax rate will be impacted by the adoption of an amendment issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d), which will require that excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to share based payments be recognized in net income.

The provision for income taxes on the gain on disposal includes the impact of non-deductible goodwill disposed of as a result of the sale.\nOutlook for 2017\nSales\nWe expect sales will be favorably impacted primarily by improving our North America business through continuing core menu improvement, product innovation and focused execution of operational excellence and brand positioning. In addition, sales are expected to benefit from higher sales growth at our new and remodeled Image Activation restaurants. The impact of Wendy's restaurants sold in 2016 will continue to result in decreased sales.\nFranchise Royalty Revenue and Fees and Franchise Rental Income\nWe expect that the sales trends for franchised restaurants will continue to be generally impacted by the factors described above under Sales\u201d related to the improvements in the North America business. The impact of Company-operated restaurants sold to franchisees in 2016 and facilitating franchisee-to-franchisee restaurant transfers under our system optimization initiative will continue to result in increased franchise royalty revenue and fees and franchise rental income.\nCost of Sales\nWe expect cost of sales, as a percent of sales, will be favorably impacted by the same factors described above for sales. We expect these favorable impacts on cost of sales, as a percent of sales, to be offset by higher restaurant labor due to increases in wages.\nGeneral and Administrative\nWe expect general and administrative expense will be favorably impacted by decreases in (1) employee compensation and related expenses primarily as a result of changes in staffing driven by our system optimization initiative, (2) incentive compensation and (3) professional services.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nWe expect depreciation and amortization will slightly decrease primarily as a result of reducing our mix of Company-operated restaurants to franchise restaurants through our system optimization initiative. As a result, we also expect accelerated depreciation and depreciation for new and reimaged restaurants under our Image Activation program to decrease.\nFranchise Rental Expense\nWe expect franchise rental expense to continue to increase due to subleasing properties to franchisees that were previously Company-operated restaurants in 2016 and as such, had been previously recorded in cost of sales.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe tables included throughout Liquidity and Capital Resources present dollars in millions.\nCash Flows\nOur primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our securitized financing facility. Principal uses of cash are operating expenses, capital expenditures, repurchases of common stock and dividends to shareholders.\nOur anticipated consolidated sources of cash and cash requirements for 2017 exclusive of operating cash flow requirements consist principally of:\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>capital expenditures of approximately $85.0 million as discussed below in Capital Expenditures;\u201d\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>quarterly cash dividends aggregating up to approximately $69.1 million as discussed below in Dividends;\u201d and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>potential stock repurchases of up to $150.0 million, of which $1.3 million was repurchased subsequent to January 1, 2017 through February 22, 2017 as discussed below in Stock Repurchases.\u201d\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased upon current levels of operations, the Company expects that available cash and cash flows from operations will provide sufficient liquidity to meet operating cash requirements for the next 12 months.\nThe table below summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years:\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>181.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(31.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>212.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(42.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>254.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>92.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>223.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(187.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>(404.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(228.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(175.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>198.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(374.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(129.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(188.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>372.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(312.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities was $181.4 million, $212.5 million and $254.8 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net income, adjusted for non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization, deferred income tax and share-based compensation, and the net change in operating assets and liabilities.\nCash provided by operating activities decreased $31.1 million during 2016 as compared to 2015, due to a decrease of $99.4 million in net income adjusted for non-cash expenses, partially offset by a favorable change in operating assets and liabilities of $68.3 million. The favorable change in operating assets and liabilities resulted from (1) an increase as a result of cash restricted for the payment of interest under our securitized financing facility during the second quarter of 2015, (2) an increase in real estate and property tax receivables in 2015 as a result of an increase in franchise restaurants in connection with our system optimization initiative and (3) a decrease in receivables for income tax refunds. These favorable changes were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a decrease in the incentive compensation accrual for the 2016 fiscal year due to weaker operating performance as compared to plan in 2016 versus 2015, as well as an increase in payments for the 2015 fiscal year.\nCash provided by operating activities decreased $42.3 million during 2015 as compared to 2014, due to an unfavorable change in operating assets and liabilities of $54.3 million, partially offset by an increase of $12.0 million in net income adjusted for non-cash expenses. The unfavorable change in operating assets and liabilities resulted from (1) an increase in receivables for income tax refunds, (2) an increase in royalty, rent and property tax receivables as a result of an increase in franchise restaurants in connection with our system optimization initiative and the impact of the 53rd week on royalty receivables and (3) an increase in restricted cash for the payment of interest under our securitized financing facility. These unfavorable changes were partially offset by the favorable impact of an increase in the incentive compensation accrual for the 2015 fiscal year due to stronger operating performance as compared to plan in 2015 versus 2014, as well as a decrease in payments for the 2014 fiscal year.\nInvesting Activities\nCash provided by investing activities increased $56.7 million during 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to (1) a decrease of $101.6 million in capital expenditures and (2) an increase of $57.8 million in proceeds from dispositions related to our system optimization initiative. These changes were partially offset by (1) a decrease of $78.4 million in proceeds from the sale of the Bakery in 2015 and (2) an increase in restricted cash for the reinvestment in capital assets under our securitized financing facility of $18.6 million.\nCash provided by investing activities increased $223.2 million during 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to (1) $78.4 million in proceeds from the sale of the Bakery, (2) a decrease of $52.7 million in payments for restaurant acquisitions, (3) a decrease of $46.8 million in capital expenditures and (4) an increase of $43.0 million in proceeds from dispositions related to our system optimization initiative.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities increased $228.7 million during 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to a net decrease in cash provided by long-term debt activities of $949.6 million resulting from the securitized financing facility and the related repayment of the 2013 Restated Credit Agreement during 2015. The unfavorable impact of long-term debt activities was partially offset by a decrease in repurchases of common stock of $761.8 million.\nCash used in financing activities decreased $198.8 million during 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to a net increase in cash provided by long-term debt activities of $961.3 million resulting from the securitized financing facility and the related repayment of the 2013 Restated Credit Agreement. The favorable impact of long-term debt activities was partially offset by an increase in repurchases of common stock of $797.5 million.\nCapitalization\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year End\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt, including current portion\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,512.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,426.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stockholders' equity\n</td> <td>527.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>752.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,040.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,179.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Wendy's Company's total capitalization at January 1, 2017 decreased $139.0 million from $3,179.0 million at January 3, 2016 and was impacted principally by the following:\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>stock repurchases of $335.3 million\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>dividends paid of $63.8 million\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>repayments of long-term debt of $24.6 million; partially offset by\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>comprehensive income of $137.2 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>capital lease obligations of $104.1 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>tax benefit from share-based compensation of $3.3 million; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>treasury share issuances of $32.7 million for exercises and vestings of share-based compensation awards.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLong-Term Debt, Including Current Portion\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year End\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Series 2015-1 Class A-2-I Notes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>864.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Series 2015-1 Class A-2-II Notes\n</td> <td>888.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Series 2015-1 Class A-2-III Notes\n</td> <td>493.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>7% debentures\n</td> <td>88.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>211.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unamortized debt issuance costs\n</td> <td>(34.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total long-term debt, including current portion\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,512.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThere were no material changes to the terms of any debt obligations since January 3, 2016.

As of January 1, 2017, the Company had $11.3 million of outstanding commitments, included in Accounts payable,\u201d for capital expenditures expected to be paid in 2017.\nDividends\nThe Wendy's Company paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.06 per share on its common stock aggregating $47.8 million in the first three quarters of 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2016, The Wendy's Company paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.065 per share on its common stock aggregating $16.0 million. During the first quarter of 2017, The Wendy's Company declared a dividend of $0.07 per share to be paid on March 15, 2017 to shareholders of record as of March 1, 2017. If The Wendy's Company pays regular quarterly cash dividends for the remainder of 2017 at the same rate as declared in the first quarter of 2017, The Wendy's Company's total cash requirement for dividends for all of 2017 would be approximately $69.1 million based on the number of shares of its common stock outstanding at February 22, 2017. The Wendy's Company currently intends to continue to declare and pay quarterly cash dividends; however, there can be no assurance that any additional quarterly dividends will be declared or paid or of the amount or timing of such dividends, if any.\nStock Repurchases\nThe following table summarizes the Company's repurchases of common stock for 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repurchases of common stock (a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>335.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,098.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>298.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of shares repurchased\n</td> <td>29.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Excludes commissions of $0.3 million, $2.4 million and $2.3 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn June 1, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program for up to $1,400.0 million of our common stock through January 1, 2017, when and if market conditions warrant and to the extent legally permissible. In November 2016, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the 2016 ASR Agreement\u201d) with a third-party financial institution to repurchase common stock as part of the Company's existing $1,400.0 million share repurchase program. Under the 2016 ASR Agreement, the Company paid the financial institution an initial purchase price of $150.0 million in cash and received an initial delivery of 11.1 million shares of common stock, representing an estimate of 85% of the total shares expected to be delivered under the 2016 ASR Agreement. The total number of shares of common stock ultimately purchased by the Company under the 2016 ASR Agreement was based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of the common stock during the term of the 2016 ASR Agreement, less an agreed discount. On December 27, 2016, the Company completed the 2016 ASR Agreement and received an additional 0.3 million shares of common stock. Additionally, during 2016, the Company repurchased 18.1 million shares with an aggregate purchase price of $185.0 million, excluding commissions of $0.3 million.

For additional information on the separate stock purchase agreement see Executive Overview - Related Party Transactions\u201d included herein. On June 30, 2015, the tender offer expired and on July 8, 2015, the Company repurchased 55.8 million shares at $11.45 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $639.0 million. On July 17, 2015, the Company repurchased 18.4 million shares at $11.45 per share, pursuant to the separate stock purchase agreement, for an aggregate purchase price of $210.9 million. As a result, the $850.0 million share repurchase program that commenced on June 3, 2015 was completed during the third quarter of 2015. During 2015, the Company incurred costs of $2.3 million in connection with the tender offer and Trian Group stock purchase agreement, which were recorded to treasury stock.\nIn August 2015, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the 2015 ASR Agreement\u201d) with a third-party financial institution to repurchase common stock as part of the Company's existing share repurchase programs.

As of January 1, 2017, the guarantee totaled $1.3 million.\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(c)\n</td> <td>The Company has outstanding letters of credit with various parties totaling $33.0 million, of which $6.2 million are cash collateralized. The Company does not expect any material loss to result from these letters of credit because we do not believe performance will be required.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInflation and Changing Prices\nWe believe that general inflation did not have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations, except as mentioned below for certain commodities, during the reporting periods. We manage any inflationary costs and commodity price increases through product mix and selective menu price increases. Delays in implementing such menu price increases and competitive pressures may limit our ability to recover such cost increases in the future. Inherent volatility experienced in certain commodity markets, such as those for beef, chicken and corn could have a significant effect on our results of operations and may have an adverse effect on us in the future. The extent of any impact will depend on our ability to increase food prices.\nSeasonality\nWendy's restaurant operations are moderately seasonal. Wendy's average restaurant sales are normally higher during the summer months than during the winter months. Because the business is moderately seasonal, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any other quarter or for the full fiscal year.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions in applying our critical accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our estimates and assumptions affect, among other things, impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, impairment of long-lived assets, restaurant dispositions, realizability of deferred tax assets, Federal and state income tax uncertainties and legal and environmental accruals. We evaluate those estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based on historical experience and on various other factors which we believe are reasonable under the circumstances.\nWe believe that the following represent our more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor goodwill impairment testing purposes, Wendy's includes two reporting units comprised of its (1) North America (defined as the United States of America and Canada) Company-operated and franchise restaurants and (2) international franchise restaurants. As of January 1, 2017, all of Wendy's goodwill of $741.4 million was associated with its North America restaurants since its international franchise restaurants goodwill was determined to be fully impaired during the fourth quarter of 2013.\nWe test goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Our annual impairment test of goodwill may be completed through a qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount. If we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting units, or if a qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the estimated carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we perform a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Under the first step, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value (including goodwill). If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and we must perform step two of the impairment test (measurement). Step two of the impairment test, if necessary, requires the estimation of the fair value for the assets and liabilities of a reporting unit in order to calculate the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. Under step two, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined by management and is based on the results of (1) estimates we made regarding the present value of the anticipated cash flows associated with each reporting unit (the income approach\u201d) and (2) the indicated value of the reporting units based on a comparison and correlation of the Company and other similar companies (the market approach\u201d).\nThe income approach, which considers factors unique to each of our reporting units and related long range plans that may not be comparable to other companies and that are not yet publicly available, is dependent on several critical management assumptions. These assumptions include estimates of future sales growth, gross margins, operating costs, income tax rates, terminal value growth rates, capital expenditures and the weighted average cost of capital (discount rate). Anticipated cash flows used under the income approach are developed every fourth quarter in conjunction with our annual budgeting process and also incorporate amounts and timing of future cash flows based on our long range plan.\nThe discount rates used in the income approach are an estimate of the rate of return that a market participant would expect of each reporting unit. To select an appropriate rate for discounting the future earnings stream, a review is made of short-term interest rate yields of long-term corporate and government bonds, as well as the typical capital structure of companies in the industry. The discount rates used for each reporting unit may vary depending on the risk inherent in the cash flow projections, as well as the risk level that would be perceived by a market participant. A terminal value is included at the end of the projection period used in our discounted cash flow analyses to reflect the remaining value that each reporting unit is expected to generate. The terminal value represents the present value in the last year of the projection period of all subsequent cash flows into perpetuity. The terminal value growth rate is a key assumption used in determining the terminal value as it represents the annual growth of all subsequent cash flows into perpetuity.\nUnder the market approach, we apply the guideline company method in estimating fair value. The guideline company method makes use of market price data of corporations whose stock is actively traded in a public market. The corporations\nwe select as guideline companies are engaged in a similar line of business or are subject to similar financial and business risks, including the opportunity for growth. The guideline company method of the market approach provides an indication of value by relating the equity or invested capital (debt plus equity) of guideline companies to various measures of their earnings and cash flow, then applying such multiples to the business being valued. The result of applying the guideline company approach is adjusted based on the incremental value associated with a controlling interest in the business. This control premium\u201d represents the amount a new controlling shareholder would pay for the benefits resulting from synergies and other potential benefits derived from controlling the enterprise.\nOur annual goodwill impairment test was completed through a qualitative assessment performed in the fourth quarter of 2016, which indicated the fair value of goodwill of our Wendy's North America restaurants was more likely than not greater than the carrying amount. The Company last completed a quantitative assessment in the fourth quarter of 2015, which indicated the fair value of goodwill of our Wendy's North America restaurants significantly exceeded the carrying amount.\nOur indefinite-lived intangible assets represent trademarks and totaled $903.0 million as of January 1, 2017. We test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. Our annual impairment test may be completed through a qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount. If we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment, or if a qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the estimated carrying value exceeds the fair value, we test for impairment using a quantitative process. Our quantitative process includes comparing the carrying value to the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, with any excess recognized as an impairment loss. Our critical estimates in the determination of the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets include the anticipated future revenues of Company-operated and franchised restaurants and the resulting cash flows.\nOur annual impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets was completed through a qualitative assessment performed in the fourth quarter of 2016, which indicated the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets was more likely than not greater than the carrying amount. The Company last completed a quantitative assessment in the fourth quarter of 2015, which indicated the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets significantly exceeded the carrying amount.\nThe estimated fair values of our goodwill reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to change as a result of many factors including, among others, any changes in our business plans, changing economic conditions and the competitive environment. Should actual cash flows and our future estimates vary adversely from those estimates we use, we may be required to recognize impairment charges in future years.\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Impairment of long-lived assets:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of January 1, 2017, the net carrying value of our long-lived tangible and definite-lived intangible assets were $1,192.3 million and $419.5 million, respectively. Our long-lived assets include (1) properties and related definite-lived intangible assets (e.g., favorable leases) that are leased and/or subleased to franchisees and (2) Company-operated restaurant assets and related definite-lived intangible assets, which include favorable leases and reacquired rights under franchise agreements.\nWe review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of our long-lived assets by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated through leases and/or subleases or by our individual Company-operated restaurants. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, then impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is included in Impairment of long-lived assets.\u201d Our critical estimates in this review process include the anticipated future cash flows from leases and/or subleases or individual Company-operated restaurants, which is used in assessing the recoverability of the respective long-lived assets. Our impairment losses principally reflect impairment charges resulting from leasing and/or subleasing long-lived assets to franchisees in connection with the sale or anticipated sale of restaurants.\nOur fair value estimates are subject to change as a result of many factors including, among others, any changes in our business plans, changing economic conditions and the competitive environment. Should actual cash flows and our\nfuture estimates vary adversely from those estimates we used, we may be required to recognize additional impairment charges in future years.\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Restaurant dispositions:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn connection with the sale of Company-operated restaurants to franchisees, the Company typically enters into several agreements, in addition to an asset purchase agreement, with franchisees including franchise, development, relationship and lease agreements. See Franchised Restaurants\u201d in Item 1 herein, for further information regarding these agreements. The Company typically sells restaurants' cash, inventory and equipment and retains ownership or the leasehold interest to the real estate to lease and/or sublease to the franchisee. The Company has determined that its restaurant dispositions usually represent multiple-element arrangements, and as such, the cash consideration received is allocated to the separate elements based on their relative selling price. Cash consideration generally includes up-front consideration for the sale of the restaurants, technical assistance fees and development fees and future cash consideration for royalties and lease payments. The Company considers the future lease payments in allocating the initial cash consideration received. The Company obtains third-party evidence to estimate the relative selling price of the stated rent under the lease and/or sublease agreements which is primarily based upon comparable market rents. Based on the Company's review of the third-party evidence the Company records favorable or unfavorable lease assets/liabilities with a corresponding offset to the gain or loss on the sale of the restaurants. The cash consideration per restaurant for technical assistance fees and development fees is consistent with the amounts stated in the related franchise agreements which are charged for separate standalone arrangements. Therefore, the Company recognizes the technical assistance and development fees when earned. Future royalty income is also recognized in revenue as earned. See Revenue Recognition\u201d in Note 1 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Item 8 for further information.\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our ability to realize deferred tax assets:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. A deferred tax asset or liability is recognized whenever there are (1) future tax effects from temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and (2) operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled.\nDeferred tax assets are recognized to the extent the Company believes these assets will more likely than not be realized. In evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including the interaction and the timing of future reversals of existing temporary differences, recent operating results, tax-planning strategies, and projected future taxable income. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results from continuing operations and incorporate assumptions including future operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage our underlying business. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income.\nWhen considered necessary, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the deferred tax assets to their anticipated realizable value. Our evaluation of the realizability of our deferred tax assets is subject to change as a result of many factors including, among others, any changes in our business plans, changing economic conditions, the competitive environment and the effect of future tax legislation. Should future taxable income vary from projected taxable income, we may be required to adjust our valuation allowance in future years.\nNet operating loss and credit carryforwards are subject to various limitations and carryforward periods. As of January 1, 2017, we have foreign tax credits of $21.7 million and state tax credits of $0.5 million, which will begin to expire in 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition, as of January 1, 2017, we have state net operating loss carryforwards of $779.8 million, which began expiring in 2017. We believe it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits will not be realized. In recognition of this risk, we have provided a valuation allowance of $11.4 million.\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Income tax uncertainties:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe measure income tax uncertainties in accordance with a two-step process of evaluating a tax position. We first determine if it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is then measured, for purposes of financial statement recognition, as the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon effective settlement. We have unrecognized tax benefits of $19.5 million, which if resolved favorably would reduce our tax expense by $14.8 million at January 1, 2017.\nWe accrue interest related to uncertain tax positions in Interest expense\u201d and penalties in General and administrative.\u201d At January 1, 2017, we had $1.3 million accrued for interest and $0.6 million accrued for penalties.\nThe Company participates in the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS\u201d) Compliance Assurance Process ( CAP\u201d). As part of CAP, tax years are examined on a contemporaneous basis so that all or most issues are resolved prior to the filing of the tax return. As such, our tax returns for fiscal years 2009 through 2015 have been settled. Certain of the Company's state income tax returns from its 2012 fiscal year and forward remain subject to examination. We believe that adequate provisions have been made for any liabilities, including interest and penalties that may result from the completion of these examinations.\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Legal and environmental accruals:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe are involved in litigation and claims incidental to our current and prior businesses, including the legal proceedings related to a cybersecurity incident as described in Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d We provide accruals for such litigation and claims when payment is probable and reasonably estimable. As of January 1, 2017, the Company had accruals for all of its legal and environmental matters aggregating $1.2 million. Most proceedings are in preliminary stages, with various motions either yet to be submitted or pending, discovery yet to occur and significant factual matters unresolved. In addition, most cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages and many involve multiple parties. Predicting the outcomes of settlement discussions or judicial or arbitral decisions are thus inherently difficult. We review our assumptions and estimates each quarter based on new developments, changes in applicable law and other relevant factors and revise our accruals accordingly.\nNew Accounting Standards\nSee Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for a summary of new or amended accounting standards applicable to us.", "item_7_truncated": "The decrease in restaurant depreciation and amortization during 2015 was primarily due to decreases in (1) accelerated depreciation on existing assets that are being replaced as part of our Image Activation program of $10.7 million and (2) depreciation on assets sold or classified as held for sale under our system optimization initiative of $10.2 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in restaurant depreciation and amortization of $13.2 million on new and reimaged Image Activation restaurants.\nOur anticipated consolidated sources of cash and cash requirements for 2017 exclusive of operating cash flow requirements consist principally of:\nOn June 1, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program for up to $1,400.0 million of our common stock through January 1, 2017, when and if market conditions warrant and to the extent legally permissible. In November 2016, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the 2016 ASR Agreement\u201d) with a third-party financial institution to repurchase common stock as part of the Company's existing $1,400.0 million share repurchase program. Under the 2016 ASR Agreement, the Company paid the financial institution an initial purchase price of $150.0 million in cash and received an initial delivery of 11.1 million shares of common stock, representing an estimate of 85% of the total shares expected to be delivered under the 2016 ASR Agreement. The total number of shares of common stock ultimately purchased by the Company under the 2016 ASR Agreement was based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of the common stock during the term of the 2016 ASR Agreement, less an agreed discount. On December 27, 2016, the Company completed the 2016 ASR Agreement and received an additional 0.3 million shares of common stock. Additionally, during 2016, the Company repurchased 18.1 million shares with an aggregate purchase price of $185.0 million, excluding commissions of $0.3 million. As a result, the Company completed substantially all of the $1,400.0 million share repurchase program. In February, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program for up to $150.0 million of our common stock through March 4, 2018. Subsequent to January 1, 2017 through February 22, 2017, the Company repurchased 0.1 million shares with an aggregate purchase price of $1.3 million, excluding commissions.\nA wholly-owned subsidiary of Wendy's leases restaurant facilities from TimWen for the operation of Wendy's/Tim Hortons combo units in Canada. Prior to the second quarter of 2015, Wendy's operated certain of the Wendy's/Tim Hortons combo units in Canada and subleased some of the restaurant facilities to franchisees. As a result of the Company completing its plan to sell all of its Company-operated restaurants in Canada to franchisees during the second quarter of 2015, all of the restaurant facilities are subleased to franchisees. Wendy's paid TimWen $11.8 million, $12.1 million and $6.3 million under these lease agreements during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, TimWen paid Wendy's a management fee under the TimWen joint venture agreement of $0.2 million each year during 2016, 2015 and 2014, which has been included as a reduction to General and administrative.\u201d\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Franchise Rental Expense\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Franchise rental expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFranchise Rental Expense\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018-2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020-2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,065.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>155.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,530.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,869.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>418.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>548.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>143.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>141.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>898.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,258.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total (e)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>252.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,285.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>372.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,847.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,756.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nThe decrease in sales during 2015 was primarily due to the impact of Wendy's Company-operated restaurants sold under our system optimization initiative, which resulted in a reduction in sales of $271.0 million.

Under the new methodology, the Company includes restaurants in its comparable sales base as soon as reimaged restaurants reopen (the New Method\u201d). Reimaged restaurants previously entered the comparable sales base after they had been open for three continuous months (the Old Method\u201d). There was no change in the reporting methodology for new restaurants, which will continue to be excluded from same-restaurant sales until they have been open for 15 continuous months. The table summarizing the results of operations provides the same-restaurant sales percent change using the New Method, as well as the Old Method. The New Method is consistent with the metric used by our management for internal reporting and analysis. Same-restaurant sales exclude the impact of currency translation. \nWe believe that general inflation did not have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations, except as mentioned below for certain commodities, during the reporting periods. We manage any inflationary costs and commodity price increases through product mix and selective menu price increases. Delays in implementing such menu price increases and competitive pressures may limit our ability to recover such cost increases in the future. Inherent volatility experienced in certain commodity markets, such as those for beef, chicken and corn could have a significant effect on our results of operations and may have an adverse effect on us in the future. The extent of any impact will depend on our ability to increase food prices.\n (c) Represents the minimum lease cash payments for operating lease obligations. Excludes aggregate related sublease rental receipts of $1,171.2 million on operating lease obligations. \nFinancing Activities\nWe measure income tax uncertainties in accordance with a two-step process of evaluating a tax position. We first determine if it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is then measured, for purposes of financial statement recognition, as the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon effective settlement. We have unrecognized tax benefits of $19.5 million, which if resolved favorably would reduce our tax expense by $14.8 million at January 1, 2017.\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of long-lived assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nby the shifting relative taxable presence in the various states as our system optimization initiative was executed.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for a summary of new or amended accounting standards applicable to us.\nCash provided by investing activities increased $223.2 million during 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to (1) $78.4 million in proceeds from the sale of the Bakery, (2) a decrease of $52.7 million in payments for restaurant acquisitions, (3) a decrease of $46.8 million in capital expenditures and (4) an increase of $43.0 million in proceeds from dispositions related to our system optimization initiative.\nOn May 31, 2015, Wendy's completed the sale of 100% of its membership interest in The New Bakery Company, LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Bakery\u201d) to East Balt US, LLC (the Buyer\u201d) for $78.5 million in cash (subject to customary purchase price adjustments). The Company recorded a pre-tax gain on the disposal of the Bakery of $25.5 million during 2015, which included transaction closing costs and a reduction of goodwill. The Company recognized income tax expense associated with the gain on disposal of $14.9 million during 2015, which included the impact of the disposal of non-deductible goodwill. In conjunction with the Bakery sale, Wendy's entered into a transition services agreement with the Buyer, pursuant to which Wendy's provided certain continuing corporate and shared services to the Buyer through March 31, 2016 for no additional consideration. The Bakery's results of operations and the gain on disposal have been included in discontinued operations.\nIn connection with the sale of Company-operated restaurants to franchisees, the Company typically enters into several agreements, in addition to an asset purchase agreement, with franchisees including franchise, development, relationship and lease agreements. See Franchised Restaurants\u201d in Item 1 herein, for further information regarding these agreements. The Company typically sells restaurants' cash, inventory and equipment and retains ownership or the leasehold interest to the real estate to lease and/or sublease to the franchisee. The Company has determined that its restaurant dispositions usually represent multiple-element arrangements, and as such, the cash consideration received is allocated to the separate elements based on their relative selling price. Cash consideration generally includes up-front consideration for the sale of the restaurants, technical assistance fees and development fees and future cash consideration for royalties and lease payments. The Company considers the future lease payments in allocating the initial cash consideration received. The Company obtains third-party evidence to estimate the relative selling price of the stated rent under the lease and/or sublease agreements which is primarily based upon comparable market rents. Based on the Company's review of the third-party evidence the Company records favorable or unfavorable lease assets/liabilities with a corresponding offset to the gain or loss on the sale of the restaurants. The cash consideration per restaurant for technical assistance fees and development fees is consistent with the amounts stated in the related franchise agreements which are charged for separate standalone arrangements. Therefore, the Company recognizes the technical assistance and development fees when earned. Future royalty income is also recognized in revenue as earned.

In the fourth quarter of 2016, The Wendy's Company paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.065 per share on its common stock aggregating $16.0 million. During the first quarter of 2017, The Wendy's Company declared a dividend of $0.07 per share to be paid on March 15, 2017 to shareholders of record as of March 1, 2017. If The Wendy's Company pays regular quarterly cash dividends for the remainder of 2017 at the same rate as declared in the first quarter of 2017, The Wendy's Company's total cash requirement for dividends for all of 2017 would be approximately $69.1 million based on the number of shares of its common stock outstanding at February 22, 2017. The Wendy's Company currently intends to continue to declare and pay quarterly cash dividends; however, there can be no assurance that any additional quarterly dividends will be declared or paid or of the amount or timing of such dividends, if any.\n \u2022 comprehensive income of $137.2 million; \nIn August 2015, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the 2015 ASR Agreement\u201d) with a third-party financial institution to repurchase common stock as part of the Company's existing share repurchase programs. Under the 2015 ASR Agreement, the Company paid the financial institution an initial purchase price of $164.5 million in cash and received an initial delivery of 14.4 million shares of common stock, representing an estimate of 85% of the total shares expected to be delivered under the 2015 ASR Agreement. The total number of shares of common stock ultimately purchased by the Company under the 2015 ASR Agreement was based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of the common stock during the term of the 2015 ASR Agreement, less an agreed discount. On September 25, 2015, the Company completed the 2015 ASR Agreement and received an additional 3.6 million shares of common stock. During 2015, the Company incurred costs of $0.1 million in connection with the 2015 ASR Agreement, which were recorded to treasury stock.\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repurchases of common stock (a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>335.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,098.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>298.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of shares repurchased\n</td> <td>29.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased upon current levels of operations, the Company expects that available cash and cash flows from operations will provide sufficient liquidity to meet operating cash requirements for the next 12 months.\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest Expense\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Series 2015-1 Senior Notes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term loans\n</td> <td>(17.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash used in financing activities increased $228.7 million during 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to a net decrease in cash provided by long-term debt activities of $949.6 million resulting from the securitized financing facility and the related repayment of the 2013 Restated Credit Agreement during 2015.

The favorable change in operating assets and liabilities resulted from (1) an increase as a result of cash restricted for the payment of interest under our securitized financing facility during the second quarter of 2015, (2) an increase in real estate and property tax receivables in 2015 as a result of an increase in franchise restaurants in connection with our system optimization initiative and (3) a decrease in receivables for income tax refunds. These favorable changes were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a decrease in the incentive compensation accrual for the 2016 fiscal year due to weaker operating performance as compared to plan in 2016 versus 2015, as well as an increase in payments for the 2015 fiscal year.\nCash provided by investing activities increased $56.7 million during 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to (1) a decrease of $101.6 million in capital expenditures and (2) an increase of $57.8 million in proceeds from dispositions related to our system optimization initiative. These changes were partially offset by (1) a decrease of $78.4 million in proceeds from the sale of the Bakery in 2015 and (2) an increase in restricted cash for the reinvestment in capital assets under our securitized financing facility of $18.6 million.\n (b) Excludes Venezuela due to the impact of Venezuela's highly inflationary economy. \nThe decrease in cost of sales, as a percent of sales, during 2015 was due to benefits from strategic price increases on our menu items and higher sales at our Image Activation restaurants.

The impact of the 53rd week in 2015 on cost of sales, as a percent of sales, was not material.\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Sales\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restaurant margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>176.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>254.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>253.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn July 4, 2011, Wendy's Restaurants completed the sale of 100% of the common stock of its then wholly-owned subsidiary, Arby's Restaurant Group, Inc.

as a result of changes in staffing driven by our system optimization initiative and (2) incentive compensation accruals due to a decrease in operating performance as compared to plan in 2016 versus 2015. These decreases in general and administrative expenses were partially offset by increases in (1) severance expense, (2) legal reserves and (3) professional services due to legal and other costs associated with the cybersecurity incident (see Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information).\nOur effective tax rates in 2016, 2015, and 2014 were impacted by variations in income from continuing operations before income taxes, adjusted for recurring items such as non-deductible expenses and state income taxes, as well as non-recurring discrete items. Discrete items, which may occur in any given year but are not consistent from year to year include the following: (1) the impact of our system optimization initiative further described below, (2) valuation allowances which decreased in 2016 and increased in 2015 and 2014 primarily as a result of changes in expected future state taxable income available to offset certain state net operating loss carryforwards (including a correction to a prior year identified and recorded in the first quarter of 2016, which resulted in a benefit of $2.9 million) and (3) a deduction for a dividend received in 2015 from our investment in Arby's.\n\n\n\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Franchise Royalty Revenue and Fees\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Royalty revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Franchise fees\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\n\nSecuritized Financing Facility\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and Amortization\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restaurants\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(24.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and other\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(22.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIntroduction\nSystem Optimization Initiative\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions in applying our critical accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our estimates and assumptions affect, among other things, impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, impairment of long-lived assets, restaurant dispositions, realizability of deferred tax assets, Federal and state income tax uncertainties and legal and environmental accruals. We evaluate those estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based on historical experience and on various other factors which we believe are reasonable under the circumstances.\nThe tables included throughout Results of Operations set forth in millions the Company's consolidated results of operations for the years ended January 1, 2017, January 3, 2016 and December 28, 2014 (except average unit volumes, which are in thousands).\n \u2022 Legal and environmental accruals: \nDeferred income taxes are not recorded for temporary differences related to our investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries which we consider permanently invested outside of the U.S. At January 1, 2017, our cash balances held outside of the U.S. totaled $97.8 million.\nExecutive Overview\n \u2022 capital lease obligations of $104.1 million; \nwe select as guideline companies are engaged in a similar line of business or are subject to similar financial and business risks, including the opportunity for growth. The guideline company method of the market approach provides an indication of value by relating the equity or invested capital (debt plus equity) of guideline companies to various measures of their earnings and cash flow, then applying such multiples to the business being valued. The result of applying the guideline company approach is adjusted based on the incremental value associated with a controlling interest in the business. This control premium\u201d represents the amount a new controlling shareholder would pay for the benefits resulting from synergies and other potential benefits derived from controlling the enterprise.\nOur primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our securitized financing facility. Principal uses of cash are operating expenses, capital expenditures, repurchases of common stock and dividends to shareholders.\nDeferred tax assets are recognized to the extent the Company believes these assets will more likely than not be realized. In evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including the interaction and the timing of future reversals of existing temporary differences, recent operating results, tax-planning strategies, and projected future taxable income. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results from continuing operations and incorporate assumptions including future operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage our underlying business. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income.\n\n \u2022 dividends paid of $63.8 million \nThe increase in franchise rental expense during 2016 and 2015 was primarily due to subleasing properties to franchisees that were previously Company-operated restaurants and as such, had been previously recorded in cost of sales. Rental expense in 2016 and 2015 also increased as a result of entering into new leases in connection with facilitating franchisee-to-franchisee restaurant transfers for purposes of subleasing such properties to the franchisee.\n\nOur Continuing Business\nThe estimated fair values of our goodwill reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to change as a result of many factors including, among others, any changes in our business plans, changing economic conditions and the competitive environment. Should actual cash flows and our future estimates vary adversely from those estimates we use, we may be required to recognize impairment charges in future years.\nWendy's has a purchasing co-op relationship agreement (the Wendy's Co-op\u201d) with its franchisees which establishes Quality Supply Chain Co-op, Inc. ( QSCC\u201d). QSCC manages, for the Wendy's system in the U.S. and Canada, contracts for the purchase and distribution of food, proprietary paper, operating supplies and equipment under national agreements with pricing based upon total system volume. QSCC's supply chain management facilitates continuity of supply and provides consolidated purchasing efficiencies while monitoring and seeking to minimize possible obsolete inventory throughout the Wendy's supply chain in the U.S. and Canada.\nThe following table summarizes the expected payments under our outstanding contractual obligations at January 1, 2017:\nThe impact of our system optimization initiative on the provision for income taxes included the effects of the disposition of non-deductible goodwill (including a correction to a prior year identified and recorded in the first quarter of 2016, which resulted in a benefit of $4.2 million), and changes to our state deferred taxes and valuation allowances on state net operating losses caused\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWendy's executed an agreement in 2013 to partner with a third-party lender to establish a financing program for franchisees that participate in our Image Activation program. Under the program, the lender agreed to provide loans to franchisees to be used for the reimaging of restaurants according to the guidelines and specifications under Wendy's Image Activation program. To support the program, Wendy's provided to the lender a $6.0 million irrevocable stand-by letter of credit, which was issued on July 1, 2013 and was cash collateralized. During 2016, the Company executed an agreement to terminate the letter of credit agreement that had been previously executed as part of the financing program.\nNet operating loss and credit carryforwards are subject to various limitations and carryforward periods. As of January 1, 2017, we have foreign tax credits of $21.7 million and state tax credits of $0.5 million, which will begin to expire in 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition, as of January 1, 2017, we have state net operating loss carryforwards of $779.8 million, which began expiring in 2017. We believe it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits will not be realized. In recognition of this risk, we have provided a valuation allowance of $11.4 million.\n \u2022 repayments of long-term debt of $24.6 million; partially offset by \n \u2022 Impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets: \n\n \u2022 treasury share issuances of $32.7 million for exercises and vestings of share-based compensation awards. \n\n\nGeneral and Administrative ( G&A\u201d) Realignment\nEffective January 1, 2011, Wendy's leased 14,333 square feet of office space to QSCC for an annual base rental of $0.2 million. The lease expired on December 31, 2016. A new lease agreement was signed effective January 1, 2017, expiring on December 31, 2020 for an annual base rental of $0.2 million. The Wendy's Company received $0.2 million of lease income from QSCC each year during 2016, 2015 and 2014, which has been recorded as a reduction of General and administrative.\u201d\nCash used in financing activities decreased $198.8 million during 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to a net increase in cash provided by long-term debt activities of $961.3 million resulting from the securitized financing facility and the related repayment of the 2013 Restated Credit Agreement. The favorable impact of long-term debt activities was partially offset by an increase in repurchases of common stock of $797.5 million.\nWendy's and its franchisees pay sourcing fees to third-party vendors on certain products sourced by QSCC. Such sourcing fees are remitted by these vendors to QSCC and are the primary means of funding QSCC's operations. Should QSCC's sourcing fees exceed its expected needs, QSCC's board of directors may return some or all of the excess to its members in the form of a patronage dividend. Wendy's recorded its share of patronage dividends of $0.9 million, $1.3 million and $1.5 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which are included as a reduction of Cost of sales.\u201d\n\n\nDuring 2014, the Company repurchased 3.0 million shares with an aggregate purchase price of $23.9 million, excluding commissions of $0.1 million, as part of the August 2014 authorization. In January 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program, which the Company fully utilized through completion of a modified Dutch auction tender offer on February 19, 2014 resulting in 29.7 million shares repurchased for an aggregate purchase price of $275.0 million. The Company incurred costs of $2.3 million in connection with the tender offer, which were recorded to treasury stock.\n\nResults of Operations\nThe tables below present key business measures which are defined and further discussed in the Executive Overview\u201d section included here-in.\nDuring 2015, the Company recognized a gain on the disposal of the Bakery of $10.6 million, net of income tax expense of $14.9 million which has been included in net income from discontinued operations. The provision for income taxes on the gain on disposal includes the impact of non-deductible goodwill disposed of as a result of the sale.\nCash Flows\nThe tables included throughout Liquidity and Capital Resources present dollars in millions.\nAs a result of the sale of the Bakery discussed above in Executive Overview - Sale of the Bakery,\u201d the Bakery's results of operations for the period from December 29, 2014 through May 31, 2015 and for the year ended 2014 have been included in Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes\u201d in the table below.\n (a) Wendy's is contingently liable for certain leases and other obligations primarily from former Company-operated restaurant locations now operated by franchisees amounting to $62.9 million as of January 1, 2017. These leases extend through 2050. In addition, Wendy's is contingently liable for certain other leases which have been assigned to unrelated third parties, who have indemnified Wendy's against future liabilities amounting to $0.7 million as of January 1, 2017. These leases expire on various dates through 2021. \nOutlook for 2017\nSupply Chain Relationship Agreement\nThe Company manages and internally reports its business geographically. The operation and franchising of Wendy's restaurants in North America comprises virtually all of our current operations and represents a single reportable segment. The revenues and operating results of Wendy's restaurants outside of North America are not material. The results of operations discussed below may not necessarily be indicative of future results.\n\nincrease in customer count. The customer count increase for the year was driven by significantly higher customer transactions during the fourth quarter of 2015, which resulted in a Company-operated same-restaurant sales increase of 3.7% during the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Sales during 2015 were negatively impacted by $7.4 million due to changes in Canadian foreign currency rates relative to the U.S. dollar.\n (b) Includes international franchised restaurants same-restaurant sales (excluding Venezuela due to the impact of Venezuela's highly inflationary economy). \n (d) Includes (1) $49.3 million for the remaining beverage purchase requirement under a beverage agreement, (2) $11.3 million for capital expenditures, (3) $2.4 million for utility commitments and (4) $0.5 million of other purchase obligations. \nLong-Term Debt, Including Current Portion\nThe changes in impairment charges were primarily driven by variations in losses from the remeasurement of properties to fair value upon determination that the assets will be leased and/or subleased to franchisees in connection with the sale of Company-operated restaurants. Such impairment charges totaled $14.0 million, $19.2 million and $12.0 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Impairment of long-lived assets also decreased during 2016 due to lower impairment charges resulting from closing Company-operated restaurants and classifying such surplus properties as held for sale.\n \u2022 Income tax uncertainties: \nOn June 1, 2015, the Company completed a $2,275.0 million securitized financing facility, which consists of the following: $875.0 million of 3.371%, $900.0 million of 4.080% and $500.0 million of 4.497% Series 2015-1 fixed rate senior secured notes (collectively, the Series 2015-1 Class A-2 Notes\u201d). In addition, the Company entered into a purchase agreement for the issuance of Series 2015-1 variable funding senior secured notes, Class A-1 (the Series 2015-1 Class A-1 Notes\u201d and, together with the Series 2015-1 Class A-2 Notes, the Series 2015-1 Senior Notes\u201d), which allows for the issuance of up to $150.0 million of variable funding notes and certain other credit instruments, including letters of credit. The proceeds from the issuance of the Series 2015-1 Class A-2 Notes, were used to repay all amounts outstanding on the Term A Loans and Term B Loans under the Company's May 16, 2013 Restated Credit Agreement amended on September 24, 2013 (the 2013 Restated Credit Agreement\u201d). In connection with the repayment of the Term A Loans and Term B Loans, the Company terminated the related interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $350.0 million and $100.0 million, respectively, which had been designated as cash flow hedges. As a result, the Company recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $7.3 million during the second quarter of 2015, primarily consisting of the write-off of deferred costs related to the 2013 Restated Credit Agreement of $7.2 million and fees paid to terminate the related interest rate swaps of $0.1 million.\n327 and 255 Company-operated restaurants to franchisees, respectively, which included the sale of all of its Company-operated restaurants in Canada. The Company recognized net gains totaling $71.9 million, $74.0 million and $91.5 million on the sale of Company-operated restaurants and other assets during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which were recorded to System optimization gains, net\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations. In addition, the Company facilitated the transfer of 144 and 71 restaurants between franchisees during 2016 and 2015, respectively. With the sale of 310 restaurants during 2016, the Company completed its plan to reduce its Company-operated restaurant ownership to approximately 5% as of January 1, 2017. Wendy's will continue to optimize its system by facilitating franchisee-to-franchisee transfers of restaurants, as well as evaluating strategic acquisitions of franchised restaurants and strategic dispositions of Company-operated restaurants to existing and new franchisees, to further strengthen the franchisee base, drive new restaurant development and accelerate Image Activation adoption.\n\n \u2022 capital expenditures of approximately $85.0 million as discussed below in Capital Expenditures;\u201d \nSale of Arby's\nDuring 2015, the Company incurred a loss on the early extinguishment of debt as a result of repaying all amounts outstanding on the Term A Loans and Term B Loans under the 2013 Restated Credit Agreement, with the proceeds from its securitized financing facility. The loss on the early extinguishment of debt was primarily comprised of the write-off of deferred costs associated with the 2013 Restated Credit Agreement of $7.2 million and fees paid to terminate the related interest rate swaps of $0.1 million.\nInvesting Activities\nOn June 2, 2015, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement to repurchase our common stock from Nelson Peltz, Peter W. May (Messrs. Peltz and May are members of the Company's Board of Directors) and Edward P. Garden (who served on the Company's Board of Directors until December 14, 2015) and certain of their family members and affiliates, investment funds managed by Trian Fund Management, L.P. (an investment management firm controlled by Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden, TFM\u201d) and the general partner of certain of those funds (together with Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden, certain of their family members and affiliates and TFM, the Trian Group\u201d), who in the aggregate owned approximately 24.8% of the Company's outstanding shares as of May 29, 2015. Pursuant to the agreement, the Trian Group agreed not to tender or sell any of its shares in the modified Dutch auction tender offer the Company commenced on June 3, 2015. Also pursuant to the agreement, the Company agreed, following completion of the tender offer, to purchase from the Trian Group a pro rata amount of its shares based on the number of shares the Company purchased in the tender offer, at the same price received by shareholders who participated in the tender offer. On July 17, 2015, after completion of the modified Dutch auction tender offer, the Company repurchased 18.4 million shares of its common stock from the Trian Group at the price paid in the tender offer of $11.45 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $210.9 million.\nThe table below summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years:\nContractual Obligations\n (a) Excludes capital lease obligations, which are shown separately in the table. The table includes interest of approximately $522.9 million. These amounts exclude the fair value adjustment related to Wendy's 7% debentures assumed in the Wendy's merger. \n (c) Excludes the impact of the 53rd week in 2015. \nThe following table summarizes the Company's repurchases of common stock for 2016, 2015 and 2014:\n\nTimWen lease and management fee payments\nCash provided by operating activities decreased $42.3 million during 2015 as compared to 2014, due to an unfavorable change in operating assets and liabilities of $54.3 million, partially offset by an increase of $12.0 million in net income adjusted for non-cash expenses. The unfavorable change in operating assets and liabilities resulted from (1) an increase in receivables for income tax refunds, (2) an increase in royalty, rent and property tax receivables as a result of an increase in franchise restaurants in connection with our system optimization initiative and the impact of the 53rd week on royalty receivables and (3) an increase in restricted cash for the payment of interest under our securitized financing facility. These unfavorable changes were partially offset by the favorable impact of an increase in the incentive compensation accrual for the 2015 fiscal year due to stronger operating performance as compared to plan in 2015 versus 2014, as well as a decrease in payments for the 2014 fiscal year.\nWe expect that the sales trends for franchised restaurants will continue to be generally impacted by the factors described above under Sales\u201d related to the improvements in the North America business. The impact of Company-operated restaurants sold to franchisees in 2016 and facilitating franchisee-to-franchisee restaurant transfers under our system optimization initiative will continue to result in increased franchise royalty revenue and fees and franchise rental income.\nThe increase in franchise rental income during 2016 and 2015 was primarily due to leasing and/or subleasing properties to franchisees in connection with the sale of Company-operated restaurants and facilitating franchisee-to-franchisee restaurant transfers.\nSales\nThe non-GAAP financial measures discussed above do not replace the presentation of the Company's financial results in accordance with GAAP. Because all companies do not calculate non-GAAP financial measures in the same way, these measures as used by other companies may not be consistent with the way the Company calculates such measures.\nInflation and Changing Prices\nDepreciation and Amortization\nSeasonality\nOur annual impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets was completed through a qualitative assessment performed in the fourth quarter of 2016, which indicated the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets was more likely than not greater than the carrying amount. The Company last completed a quantitative assessment in the fourth quarter of 2015, which indicated the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets significantly exceeded the carrying amount.\nThe improvement in cost of sales, as a percent of sales, during 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in commodity costs, reflecting lower beef prices. In addition, the increase in same-restaurant sales and higher sales at our new and remodeled Image Activation restaurants contributed to the improvement in cost of sales, as a percent of sales. These decreases in cost of sales, as a percent of sales, were partially offset by (1) higher medical insurance costs, (2) increased labor rates and (3) the negative impact of changes in product mix.\nWe expect sales will be favorably impacted primarily by improving our North America business through continuing core menu improvement, product innovation and focused execution of operational excellence and brand positioning. In addition, sales are expected to benefit from higher sales growth at our new and remodeled Image Activation restaurants. The impact of Wendy's restaurants sold in 2016 will continue to result in decreased sales.\nFor goodwill impairment testing purposes, Wendy's includes two reporting units comprised of its (1) North America (defined as the United States of America and Canada) Company-operated and franchise restaurants and (2) international franchise restaurants. As of January 1, 2017, all of Wendy's goodwill of $741.4 million was associated with its North America restaurants since its international franchise restaurants goodwill was determined to be fully impaired during the fourth quarter of 2013.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWendy's long-term growth opportunities will be driven by a combination of brand relevance and economic relevance. Key components of growth include (1) systemwide same-restaurant sales growth through continuing core menu improvement, product innovation and customer count growth, (2) investing in our Image Activation program, which includes innovative exterior and interior restaurant designs for our new and reimaged restaurants and focused execution of operational excellence, (3) growth in new restaurants, including global growth, (4) increased restaurant utilization in various dayparts and brand access utilizing mobile technology, (5) building shareholder value through financial management strategies and (6) our system optimization initiative.\nCash provided by operating activities was $181.4 million, $212.5 million and $254.8 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net income, adjusted for non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization, deferred income tax and share-based compensation, and the net change in operating assets and liabilities.\nKey Business Measures\nWe are involved in litigation and claims incidental to our current and prior businesses, including the legal proceedings related to a cybersecurity incident as described in Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d We provide accruals for such litigation and claims when payment is probable and reasonably estimable. As of January 1, 2017, the Company had accruals for all of its legal and environmental matters aggregating $1.2 million. Most proceedings are in preliminary stages, with various motions either yet to be submitted or pending, discovery yet to occur and significant factual matters unresolved. In addition, most cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages and many involve multiple parties. Predicting the outcomes of settlement discussions or judicial or arbitral decisions are thus inherently difficult. We review our assumptions and estimates each quarter based on new developments, changes in applicable law and other relevant factors and revise our accruals accordingly.\n \u2022 Our ability to realize deferred tax assets: \nThere were no material changes to the terms of any debt obligations since January 3, 2016. See Note 11 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Item 8 herein, for further information related to our long-term debt obligations.\nThe decrease in sales during 2016 was primarily due to the impact of Wendy's Company-operated restaurants sold under our system optimization initiative, which resulted in a reduction in sales of $560.0 million. In addition, 2016 included one less week of sales when compared to 2015, which resulted in a reduction in sales of $19.2 million. Company-operated same-restaurant sales during 2016 increased 2.7% primarily due to an increase in customer count. Sales also benefited from higher sales growth at our new and remodeled Image Activation restaurants.\nThe increase in other operating income, net during 2016 was primarily due to a gain recognized on a lease buyout during the first quarter of 2016. In addition, 2016 includes costs incurred to provide customer care and help desk support services to our franchisees. The decrease in other operating income, net during 2015 was primarily due to lower equity in earnings in joint ventures.\n\nThe decrease in distributions, including dividends in 2016 was primarily a result of a $54.9 million dividend we received in 2015 from our investment in Arby's.\nThe Company's fiscal reporting periods consist of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Sunday closest to December 31 and are referred to herein as (1) the year ended January 1, 2017\u201d or 2016,\u201d which consisted of 52 weeks, (2) the year ended January 3, 2016\u201d or 2015,\u201d which consisted of 53 weeks, and (3) the year ended December 28, 2014\u201d or 2014,\u201d which consisted of 52 weeks. All references to years and quarters relate to fiscal periods rather than calendar periods.\nWe review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of our long-lived assets by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated through leases and/or subleases or by our individual Company-operated restaurants. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, then impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is included in Impairment of long-lived assets.\u201d Our critical estimates in this review process include the anticipated future cash flows from leases and/or subleases or individual Company-operated restaurants, which is used in assessing the recoverability of the respective long-lived assets. Our impairment losses principally reflect impairment charges resulting from leasing and/or subleasing long-lived assets to franchisees in connection with the sale or anticipated sale of restaurants.\n_____________________\n (b) Wendy's provides loan guarantees to various lenders on behalf of franchisees under debt arrangements for new restaurant development and equipment financing to promote systemwide initiatives. Recourse on the majority of these loans is limited, generally to a percentage of the original loan amount or the current loan balance on individual franchisee loans or an aggregate minimum for the entire loan arrangement. \nOur indefinite-lived intangible assets represent trademarks and totaled $903.0 million as of January 1, 2017. We test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. Our annual impairment test may be completed through a qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount. If we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment, or if a qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the estimated carrying value exceeds the fair value, we test for impairment using a quantitative process. Our quantitative process includes comparing the carrying value to the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, with any excess recognized as an impairment loss. Our critical estimates in the determination of the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets include the anticipated future revenues of Company-operated and franchised restaurants and the resulting cash flows.\nAs of January 1, 2017, the net carrying value of our long-lived tangible and definite-lived intangible assets were $1,192.3 million and $419.5 million, respectively. Our long-lived assets include (1) properties and related definite-lived intangible assets (e.g., favorable leases) that are leased and/or subleased to franchisees and (2) Company-operated restaurant assets and related definite-lived intangible assets, which include favorable leases and reacquired rights under franchise agreements.\nUnder the market approach, we apply the guideline company method in estimating fair value. The guideline company method makes use of market price data of corporations whose stock is actively traded in a public market. The corporations\nCitationAir Aircraft Lease Agreement\n \u2022 quarterly cash dividends aggregating up to approximately $69.1 million as discussed below in Dividends;\u201d and \n\n________________\nWe believe that the following represent our more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\n \u2022 Restaurant Margin - We define restaurant margin as sales from Company-operated restaurants less cost of sales divided by sales from Company-operated restaurants. Cost of sales includes food and paper, restaurant labor and occupancy, advertising and other operating costs. Restaurant margin is influenced by factors such as restaurant openings and closures, price increases, the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing initiatives, featured products, product mix, the level of our fixed and semi-variable costs and fluctuations in food and labor costs. \nIn order to promote Image Activation new restaurant development, Wendy's has an incentive program for franchisees that provides for reductions in royalty and national advertising payments for up to the first two years of operation for qualifying new restaurants opened by December 31, 2020, with the value of the incentives declining in the later years of the program. Wendy's also has incentive programs for 2017 available to franchisees that commence Image Activation restaurant remodels by December 15, 2017. The remodel incentive programs provide for reductions in royalty payments for one year after the completion of construction.\nCapital Expenditures\nSale of the Bakery\n\nAlso as part of the June 2015 authorization, the Company repurchased 2.1 million shares during 2015 with an aggregate purchase price of $22.0 million, of which $1.7 million was accrued at January 3, 2016 and excluding commissions.\n \u2022 Average Unit Volumes - We calculate Company-operated restaurant average unit volumes by summing the average weekly sales of all Company-operated restaurants which reported sales during the week.  Franchised restaurant average unit volumes is a non-GAAP financial measure, which includes sales by franchised restaurants, which are reported by our franchisees and represent their revenues from sales at franchised Wendy's restaurants. The Company's consolidated financial statements do not include sales by franchised restaurants to their customers. The Company believes franchised restaurant average unit volumes is useful information for the same reasons described above for Systemwide Sales.\u201d We calculate franchised restaurant average unit volumes by summing the average weekly sales of all franchised restaurants which reported sales during the week.\nDuring 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company sold 310, 327 and 255 Company-operated restaurants to franchisees, respectively, under its system optimization initiative. System optimization gains, net in 2014 includes the impact of recording net favorable lease assets of $36.3 million as a result of leasing and/or subleasing land, buildings, and/or leasehold improvements to franchisees, in connection with the sales of restaurants. See Note 2 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Item 8 herein for further discussion.\nIn July 2013, the Company announced a system optimization initiative, as part of its brand transformation, which includes a shift from Company-operated restaurants to franchised restaurants over time, through acquisitions and dispositions, as well as helping to facilitate franchisee-to-franchisee restaurant transfers. In February 2015, the Company announced plans to sell approximately 540 additional restaurants to franchisees and reduce its ongoing Company-operated restaurant ownership to approximately 5% of the total system by the end of 2016. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company completed the sale of 310,\nFranchise Royalty Revenue and Fees and Franchise Rental Income\nThe increase in franchise royalty revenue and fees during 2015 was primarily due to sales of Company-operated restaurants to franchisees and facilitating franchisee-to-franchisee restaurant transfers under our system optimization initiative. Royalty revenue was also positively impacted by an increase in franchise same-restaurant sales, which excludes sales during the 53rd week of 2015. We believe franchise same-restaurant sales were higher than Company-operated same-restaurant sales during 2015 due to higher price increases. Royalty revenue also includes approximately $6.0 million for the 53rd week of 2015.\nIn 2016, cash capital expenditures amounted to $150.0 million and non-cash capital expenditures, consisting of capitalized lease obligations, amounted to $104.1 million. In 2017, we expect that cash capital expenditures will amount to approximately $85.0 million, principally relating to (1) reimaging Company-operated restaurants, (2) the opening of new Image Activation Company-operated restaurants, (3) technology, including consumer-facing restaurant technology, (4) maintenance capital expenditures for our Company-operated restaurants and (5) various other capital projects. As of January 1, 2017, the Company had $11.3 million of outstanding commitments, included in Accounts payable,\u201d for capital expenditures expected to be paid in 2017.\nFranchisee Incentive Programs\nThe decrease in general and administrative expenses during 2015 was primarily due to (1) a decrease in share-based compensation primarily as a result of awards granted and timing of expense recognition, (2) a decrease in franchise incentives due to the 2015 Image Activation incentive program solely including royalty reductions as compared to our 2014 program which also included a cash incentive and (3) a decrease in employee compensation and related expenses primarily as a result of the realignment of our U.S. field operations and Restaurant Support Center in Dublin, Ohio as part of our G&A realignment plan to reduce general and administrative expenses. These decreases were partially offset by higher incentive compensation accruals due to stronger operating performance as compared to plan in 2015 versus 2014.\nGuarantees and Other Contingencies\nfuture estimates vary adversely from those estimates we used, we may be required to recognize additional impairment charges in future years.\n \u2022 tax benefit from share-based compensation of $3.3 million; and \nThe Company participates in the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS\u201d) Compliance Assurance Process ( CAP\u201d). As part of CAP, tax years are examined on a contemporaneous basis so that all or most issues are resolved prior to the filing of the tax return. As such, our tax returns for fiscal years 2009 through 2015 have been settled. Certain of the Company's state income tax returns from its 2012 fiscal year and forward remain subject to examination. We believe that adequate provisions have been made for any liabilities, including interest and penalties that may result from the completion of these examinations.\nWe expect franchise rental expense to continue to increase due to subleasing properties to franchisees that were previously Company-operated restaurants in 2016 and as such, had been previously recorded in cost of sales.\n (e) Excludes obligation for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, of $21.5 million. We are unable to predict when and if cash payments will be required. \nWendy's operating results are impacted by a number of external factors, including unemployment, general economic trends, intense price competition, commodity costs, labor costs and weather.\nWendy's revenues for 2016 include: (1) $920.8 million of sales at Company-operated restaurants, (2) $371.5 million of royalty revenue and fees and (3) $143.1 million of franchise rental income. In 2016, substantially all of our Wendy's royalty agreements provided for royalties of 4.0% of franchise revenues.\nFranchisee Image Activation Incentive Programs\nThe decrease in restaurant depreciation and amortization during 2016 was primarily due to decreases in (1) depreciation on assets sold or classified as held for sale under our system optimization initiative of $19.5 million and (2) accelerated depreciation on existing assets that are being replaced as part of our Image Activation program of $6.0 million.\nWe expect cost of sales, as a percent of sales, will be favorably impacted by the same factors described above for sales. We expect these favorable impacts on cost of sales, as a percent of sales, to be offset by higher restaurant labor due to increases in wages.\n \u2022 Impairment of long-lived assets: \nAs of January 1, 2017, the Wendy's restaurant system was comprised of 6,537 restaurants, of which 330 were owned and operated by the Company. All of our Company-operated restaurants are located in the U.S. as a result of the Company completing its initiative during the second quarter of 2015 to sell all Company-operated restaurants in Canada to franchisees.\nAs a result of the sale of the Bakery as discussed above in Executive Overview - Sale of the Bakery,\u201d the Bakery's results of operations for the period from December 29, 2014 through May 31, 2015 and for the year ended 2014 have been included in Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes\u201d in the table above. 2015 includes a reduction to cost of sales of $12,486 resulting from the reversal of a liability recorded during 2013 associated with the Bakery's withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan. See Note 19 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Item 8 herein for further discussion.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2017, our effective tax rate will be impacted by the adoption of an amendment issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d), which will require that excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to share based payments be recognized in net income. See Note 1 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Item 8 herein for further discussion.\nWhen considered necessary, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the deferred tax assets to their anticipated realizable value. Our evaluation of the realizability of our deferred tax assets is subject to change as a result of many factors including, among others, any changes in our business plans, changing economic conditions, the competitive environment and the effect of future tax legislation. Should future taxable income vary from projected taxable income, we may be required to adjust our valuation allowance in future years.\nOur annual goodwill impairment test was completed through a qualitative assessment performed in the fourth quarter of 2016, which indicated the fair value of goodwill of our Wendy's North America restaurants was more likely than not greater than the carrying amount. The Company last completed a quantitative assessment in the fourth quarter of 2015, which indicated the fair value of goodwill of our Wendy's North America restaurants significantly exceeded the carrying amount.\n (a) Excludes commissions of $0.3 million, $2.4 million and $2.3 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. \n\nCosts related to our system optimization initiative are recorded to Reorganization and realignment costs.\u201d During 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company recognized costs totaling $9.4 million, $11.6 million and $19.0 million, respectively, which primarily included severance and related employee costs, accelerated depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense and professional fees. The Company expects to incur additional costs, primarily comprised of professional fees, of approximately $1.3 million during 2017 in connection with an in-process transaction as of January 1, 2017. Costs incurred during 2017 related to facilitating franchisee-to-franchisee transfers of restaurants will be recorded to Other operating income, net.\u201d\nNew Accounting Standards\n (d) The decrease in average unit volumes for international franchised restaurants is primarily driven by changes in the countries and territories in which the franchised restaurants operate, as well as the impact of foreign currency translation. \nWe expect depreciation and amortization will slightly decrease primarily as a result of reducing our mix of Company-operated restaurants to franchise restaurants through our system optimization initiative. As a result, we also expect accelerated depreciation and depreciation for new and reimaged restaurants under our Image Activation program to decrease.\nCybersecurity Incident\nDuring 2014, Wendy's provided a C$2.3 million ($1.7 million as of January 1, 2017) guarantee to a lender on behalf of a franchisee, in connection with the sale of restaurants to the franchisee under the Company's system optimization initiative. As a result, the total amount of the guarantee was recorded as a deferred gain in 2014 and is included in Other liabilities.\u201d\nIn August 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program for up to $100.0 million of our common stock through December 31, 2015, when and if market conditions warrant and to the extent legally permissible. As part of the August 2014 authorization, $76.1 million remained available as of December 28, 2014. During the first and second quarters of 2015, the Company repurchased 5.7 million shares with an aggregate purchase price of $61.6 million, excluding commissions of $0.1 million. During the third quarter of 2015, the Company repurchased $14.5 million through the 2015 ASR Agreement described above. As a result, the $100.0 million share repurchase program authorized in August 2014 was completed.\nThe Company first reported unusual payment card activity affecting some franchise-owned restaurants in February 2016 and that malware had been discovered on certain systems. Subsequently, on June 9, 2016, the Company reported that an additional malware variant had been identified and disabled. On July 7, 2016, the Company, on behalf of affected franchise locations, provided information about specific restaurant locations that may have been impacted by these attacks, all of which are located in the United States, along with support for customers who may have been affected by the malware variants. See Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nThe Wendy's Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, was party to a three-year aircraft management and lease agreement, which expired in March 2014, with CitationAir, a subsidiary of Cessna Aircraft Company, pursuant to which the Company leased a corporate aircraft to CitationAir to use as part of its Jet Card program fleet. During the first quarter of 2014, our Chairman, who was our former Chief Executive Officer, and our Vice Chairman, who was our former President and Chief Operating Officer (the Former Executives\u201d) and a director, who was our former Vice Chairman, and members of their immediate families, used their Jet Card agreements for business and personal travel on aircraft in the Jet Card program fleet. A management company formed by the Former Executives and a director (the Management Company\u201d) paid CitationAir directly, and the Company received credit from CitationAir for charges related to such travel of approximately $0.4 million during 2014.\nIn November 2014, the Company initiated a plan to reduce its general and administrative expenses. The plan included a realignment and reinvestment of resources to focus primarily on accelerated restaurant development and consumer-facing restaurant technology to drive long-term growth. The Company achieved the majority of the expense reductions through the realignment of its U.S. field operations and savings at its Restaurant Support Center in Dublin, Ohio, which was substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of 2015. Costs related to G&A realignment are recorded to Reorganization and realignment costs.\u201d The Company recognized costs totaling $0.7 million, $10.3 million and $12.9 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which primarily included severance and related employee costs, share-based compensation and recruitment and relocation costs. No additional costs are expected to be incurred under the G&A realignment plan.\nIn addition, Wendy's had incentive programs that included reductions in royalty payments in 2016, 2015 and 2014 as well as cash incentives for franchisees' participation in Wendy's Image Activation program throughout 2014. The Company recognized expense of $4.4 million for cash incentives in General and administrative\u201d during 2014.\nStock Repurchases\nDuring 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company recognized costs associated with its G&A realignment plan totaling $0.7 million, $10.3 million and $12.9 million, respectively. During 2016, costs primarily included recruitment and relocation costs. In 2015, costs primarily included (1) share-based compensation expense of $5.6 million, (2) severance and related employee costs of $3.0 million and (3) recruitment and relocation costs of $1.7 million. During 2014, the Company recorded costs aggregating $12.9 million, which primarily included severance and related employee costs.\nStock Purchase Agreement\nDividends\n \u2022 Systemwide Sales - Systemwide sales is a non-GAAP financial measure, which includes sales by both Company-operated restaurants and franchised restaurants. Franchised restaurants' sales are reported by our franchisees and represent their revenues from sales at franchised Wendy's restaurants. The Company's consolidated financial statements do not include sales by franchised restaurants to their customers. The Company believes systemwide sales data is useful in assessing consumer demand for the Company's products, the overall success of the Wendy's brand and, ultimately, the performance of the Company. The Company's royalty revenues are computed as percentages of sales made by Wendy's franchisees. As a result, sales by Wendy's franchisees have a direct effect on the Company's royalty revenues and therefore on the Company's profitability.  The Company reviews systemwide sales for its international franchised restaurants on a constant currency basis. Constant currency results exclude the impact of foreign currency translation and are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. The Company believes excluding the impact of foreign currency translation provides better year over year comparability.\nFranchisee Image Activation Financing Program\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of The Wendy's Company ( The Wendy's Company\u201d and, together with its subsidiaries, the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d or our\u201d) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere within this report. Certain statements we make under this Item 7 constitute forward-looking statements\u201d under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Projections\u201d in Part I\u201d preceding Item 1 - Business.\u201d You should consider our forward-looking statements in light of the risks discussed under the heading Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A above, as well as our consolidated financial statements, related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe income approach, which considers factors unique to each of our reporting units and related long range plans that may not be comparable to other companies and that are not yet publicly available, is dependent on several critical management assumptions. These assumptions include estimates of future sales growth, gross margins, operating costs, income tax rates, terminal value growth rates, capital expenditures and the weighted average cost of capital (discount rate). Anticipated cash flows used under the income approach are developed every fourth quarter in conjunction with our annual budgeting process and also incorporate amounts and timing of future cash flows based on our long range plan.\n________________\nWe accrue interest related to uncertain tax positions in Interest expense\u201d and penalties in General and administrative.\u201d At January 1, 2017, we had $1.3 million accrued for interest and $0.6 million accrued for penalties.\nThe increase in interest expense during 2016 and 2015 was primarily a result of the Company completing a $2,275.0 million securitized financing facility on June 1, 2015. The proceeds were used to repay all amounts outstanding on the Term A Loans and Term B Loans under the Company's 2013 Restated Credit Agreement. The securitized financing facility includes the Series 2015-1 Class A-2 Notes, which are comprised of fixed interest rate notes, and the Series 2015-1 Class A-1 Notes, which allow for the issuance up to $150.0 million of variable funding notes. The principal amounts outstanding on the Series 2015-1 Class A-2 Notes significantly exceed the amounts that were outstanding on the Term A Loans and Term B Loans. In addition, the Series 2015-1 Class A-2 Notes bear fixed-rate interest at rates higher than our historical effective interest rates on our variable interest rate Term A Loans and Term B Loans. Interest expense also increased during 2016 due to an increase in capital lease obligations resulting from facilitating franchisee-to-franchisee restaurant transfers and subleasing such properties to the franchisee.", "item_7_text": "The decrease in restaurant depreciation and amortization during 2015 was primarily due to decreases in (1) accelerated depreciation on existing assets that are being replaced as part of our Image Activation program of $10.7 million and (2) depreciation on assets sold or classified as held for sale under our system optimization initiative of $10.2 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in restaurant depreciation and amortization of $13.2 million on new and reimaged Image Activation restaurants.\nOur anticipated consolidated sources of cash and cash requirements for 2017 exclusive of operating cash flow requirements consist principally of:\nOn June 1, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program for up to $1,400.0 million of our common stock through January 1, 2017, when and if market conditions warrant and to the extent legally permissible. In November 2016, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the 2016 ASR Agreement\u201d) with a third-party financial institution to repurchase common stock as part of the Company's existing $1,400.0 million share repurchase program. Under the 2016 ASR Agreement, the Company paid the financial institution an initial purchase price of $150.0 million in cash and received an initial delivery of 11.1 million shares of common stock, representing an estimate of 85% of the total shares expected to be delivered under the 2016 ASR Agreement. The total number of shares of common stock ultimately purchased by the Company under the 2016 ASR Agreement was based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of the common stock during the term of the 2016 ASR Agreement, less an agreed discount. On December 27, 2016, the Company completed the 2016 ASR Agreement and received an additional 0.3 million shares of common stock. Additionally, during 2016, the Company repurchased 18.1 million shares with an aggregate purchase price of $185.0 million, excluding commissions of $0.3 million. As a result, the Company completed substantially all of the $1,400.0 million share repurchase program. In February, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program for up to $150.0 million of our common stock through March 4, 2018. Subsequent to January 1, 2017 through February 22, 2017, the Company repurchased 0.1 million shares with an aggregate purchase price of $1.3 million, excluding commissions.\nA wholly-owned subsidiary of Wendy's leases restaurant facilities from TimWen for the operation of Wendy's/Tim Hortons combo units in Canada. Prior to the second quarter of 2015, Wendy's operated certain of the Wendy's/Tim Hortons combo units in Canada and subleased some of the restaurant facilities to franchisees. As a result of the Company completing its plan to sell all of its Company-operated restaurants in Canada to franchisees during the second quarter of 2015, all of the restaurant facilities are subleased to franchisees. Wendy's paid TimWen $11.8 million, $12.1 million and $6.3 million under these lease agreements during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, TimWen paid Wendy's a management fee under the TimWen joint venture agreement of $0.2 million each year during 2016, 2015 and 2014, which has been included as a reduction to General and administrative.\u201d\nFranchise Rental Expense\n\nThe decrease in sales during 2015 was primarily due to the impact of Wendy's Company-operated restaurants sold under our system optimization initiative, which resulted in a reduction in sales of $271.0 million. This decrease in sales was partially offset by sales during the 53rd week of 2015 of $19.2 million, which were excluded from same-restaurant sales, and sales from restaurants acquired of $36.9 million. Company-operated same-restaurant sales during 2015 increased due to an increase in our average per customer check amount, which reflects benefits from strategic price increases on our menu items and changes in product mix. Same-restaurant sales also benefited from higher sales growth at our new and remodeled Image Activation restaurants and a slight\nAlso as part of the June 2015 authorization, the Company commenced an $850.0 million share repurchase program on June 3, 2015, which included (1) a modified Dutch auction tender offer to repurchase up to $639.0 million of our common stock and (2) a separate stock purchase agreement to repurchase up to $211.0 million of our common stock from the Trian Group. For additional information on the separate stock purchase agreement see Executive Overview - Related Party Transactions\u201d included herein. On June 30, 2015, the tender offer expired and on July 8, 2015, the Company repurchased 55.8 million shares at $11.45 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $639.0 million. On July 17, 2015, the Company repurchased 18.4 million shares at $11.45 per share, pursuant to the separate stock purchase agreement, for an aggregate purchase price of $210.9 million. As a result, the $850.0 million share repurchase program that commenced on June 3, 2015 was completed during the third quarter of 2015. During 2015, the Company incurred costs of $2.3 million in connection with the tender offer and Trian Group stock purchase agreement, which were recorded to treasury stock.\n\n\nWe expect general and administrative expense will be favorably impacted by decreases in (1) employee compensation and related expenses primarily as a result of changes in staffing driven by our system optimization initiative, (2) incentive compensation and (3) professional services.\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. A deferred tax asset or liability is recognized whenever there are (1) future tax effects from temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and (2) operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled.\n (a) On a constant currency basis, systemwide sales for international franchised restaurants increased 3.8% and 0.8% during 2016 and 2015, respectively. \nCost of Sales\n\nOur fair value estimates are subject to change as a result of many factors including, among others, any changes in our business plans, changing economic conditions and the competitive environment. Should actual cash flows and our\nWe test goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Our annual impairment test of goodwill may be completed through a qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount. If we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting units, or if a qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the estimated carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we perform a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Under the first step, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value (including goodwill). If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and we must perform step two of the impairment test (measurement). Step two of the impairment test, if necessary, requires the estimation of the fair value for the assets and liabilities of a reporting unit in order to calculate the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. Under step two, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined by management and is based on the results of (1) estimates we made regarding the present value of the anticipated cash flows associated with each reporting unit (the income approach\u201d) and (2) the indicated value of the reporting units based on a comparison and correlation of the Company and other similar companies (the market approach\u201d).\nThe discount rates used in the income approach are an estimate of the rate of return that a market participant would expect of each reporting unit. To select an appropriate rate for discounting the future earnings stream, a review is made of short-term interest rate yields of long-term corporate and government bonds, as well as the typical capital structure of companies in the industry. The discount rates used for each reporting unit may vary depending on the risk inherent in the cash flow projections, as well as the risk level that would be perceived by a market participant. A terminal value is included at the end of the projection period used in our discounted cash flow analyses to reflect the remaining value that each reporting unit is expected to generate. The terminal value represents the present value in the last year of the projection period of all subsequent cash flows into perpetuity. The terminal value growth rate is a key assumption used in determining the terminal value as it represents the annual growth of all subsequent cash flows into perpetuity.\nDuring 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company recognized costs associated with its system optimization initiative totaling $9.4 million, $11.6 million and $19.0 million, respectively. During 2016, costs primarily included professional fees of $7.4 million and accelerated amortization of previously acquired franchise rights of $1.6 million. In 2015, costs primarily included accelerated amortization of previously acquired franchise rights of $6.4 million and professional fees of $3.4 million. During 2014, costs primarily included (1) severance and related employee costs of $7.6 million, (2) share-based compensation expense of $3.8 million and (3) professional fees of $3.4 million.\n \u2022 Same-Restaurant Sales - Beginning with the first quarter of 2016, the Company revised its reporting methodology for same-restaurant sales to simplify the reporting of its same-restaurant sales performance for reimaged restaurants and to better align with restaurant-industry practice. Under the new methodology, the Company includes restaurants in its comparable sales base as soon as reimaged restaurants reopen (the New Method\u201d). Reimaged restaurants previously entered the comparable sales base after they had been open for three continuous months (the Old Method\u201d). There was no change in the reporting methodology for new restaurants, which will continue to be excluded from same-restaurant sales until they have been open for 15 continuous months. The table summarizing the results of operations provides the same-restaurant sales percent change using the New Method, as well as the Old Method. The New Method is consistent with the metric used by our management for internal reporting and analysis. Same-restaurant sales exclude the impact of currency translation. \nWe believe that general inflation did not have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations, except as mentioned below for certain commodities, during the reporting periods. We manage any inflationary costs and commodity price increases through product mix and selective menu price increases. Delays in implementing such menu price increases and competitive pressures may limit our ability to recover such cost increases in the future. Inherent volatility experienced in certain commodity markets, such as those for beef, chicken and corn could have a significant effect on our results of operations and may have an adverse effect on us in the future. The extent of any impact will depend on our ability to increase food prices.\n (c) Represents the minimum lease cash payments for operating lease obligations. Excludes aggregate related sublease rental receipts of $1,171.2 million on operating lease obligations. \nFinancing Activities\nWe measure income tax uncertainties in accordance with a two-step process of evaluating a tax position. We first determine if it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is then measured, for purposes of financial statement recognition, as the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon effective settlement. We have unrecognized tax benefits of $19.5 million, which if resolved favorably would reduce our tax expense by $14.8 million at January 1, 2017.\nby the shifting relative taxable presence in the various states as our system optimization initiative was executed. These items, which are non-recurring, increased tax expense by $2.8 million, $15.1 million and $9.5 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n________________\nGeneral and Administrative\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nSee Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for a summary of new or amended accounting standards applicable to us.\nCash provided by investing activities increased $223.2 million during 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to (1) $78.4 million in proceeds from the sale of the Bakery, (2) a decrease of $52.7 million in payments for restaurant acquisitions, (3) a decrease of $46.8 million in capital expenditures and (4) an increase of $43.0 million in proceeds from dispositions related to our system optimization initiative.\nOn May 31, 2015, Wendy's completed the sale of 100% of its membership interest in The New Bakery Company, LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Bakery\u201d) to East Balt US, LLC (the Buyer\u201d) for $78.5 million in cash (subject to customary purchase price adjustments). The Company recorded a pre-tax gain on the disposal of the Bakery of $25.5 million during 2015, which included transaction closing costs and a reduction of goodwill. The Company recognized income tax expense associated with the gain on disposal of $14.9 million during 2015, which included the impact of the disposal of non-deductible goodwill. In conjunction with the Bakery sale, Wendy's entered into a transition services agreement with the Buyer, pursuant to which Wendy's provided certain continuing corporate and shared services to the Buyer through March 31, 2016 for no additional consideration. The Bakery's results of operations and the gain on disposal have been included in discontinued operations.\nIn connection with the sale of Company-operated restaurants to franchisees, the Company typically enters into several agreements, in addition to an asset purchase agreement, with franchisees including franchise, development, relationship and lease agreements. See Franchised Restaurants\u201d in Item 1 herein, for further information regarding these agreements. The Company typically sells restaurants' cash, inventory and equipment and retains ownership or the leasehold interest to the real estate to lease and/or sublease to the franchisee. The Company has determined that its restaurant dispositions usually represent multiple-element arrangements, and as such, the cash consideration received is allocated to the separate elements based on their relative selling price. Cash consideration generally includes up-front consideration for the sale of the restaurants, technical assistance fees and development fees and future cash consideration for royalties and lease payments. The Company considers the future lease payments in allocating the initial cash consideration received. The Company obtains third-party evidence to estimate the relative selling price of the stated rent under the lease and/or sublease agreements which is primarily based upon comparable market rents. Based on the Company's review of the third-party evidence the Company records favorable or unfavorable lease assets/liabilities with a corresponding offset to the gain or loss on the sale of the restaurants. The cash consideration per restaurant for technical assistance fees and development fees is consistent with the amounts stated in the related franchise agreements which are charged for separate standalone arrangements. Therefore, the Company recognizes the technical assistance and development fees when earned. Future royalty income is also recognized in revenue as earned. See Revenue Recognition\u201d in Note 1 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Item 8 for further information.\n \u2022 Restaurant dispositions: \n_______________\nWe track our results of operations and manage our business using the following key business measures, which include non-GAAP financial measures:\n\nThe Wendy's Company paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.06 per share on its common stock aggregating $47.8 million in the first three quarters of 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2016, The Wendy's Company paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.065 per share on its common stock aggregating $16.0 million. During the first quarter of 2017, The Wendy's Company declared a dividend of $0.07 per share to be paid on March 15, 2017 to shareholders of record as of March 1, 2017. If The Wendy's Company pays regular quarterly cash dividends for the remainder of 2017 at the same rate as declared in the first quarter of 2017, The Wendy's Company's total cash requirement for dividends for all of 2017 would be approximately $69.1 million based on the number of shares of its common stock outstanding at February 22, 2017. The Wendy's Company currently intends to continue to declare and pay quarterly cash dividends; however, there can be no assurance that any additional quarterly dividends will be declared or paid or of the amount or timing of such dividends, if any.\n \u2022 comprehensive income of $137.2 million; \nIn August 2015, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the 2015 ASR Agreement\u201d) with a third-party financial institution to repurchase common stock as part of the Company's existing share repurchase programs. Under the 2015 ASR Agreement, the Company paid the financial institution an initial purchase price of $164.5 million in cash and received an initial delivery of 14.4 million shares of common stock, representing an estimate of 85% of the total shares expected to be delivered under the 2015 ASR Agreement. The total number of shares of common stock ultimately purchased by the Company under the 2015 ASR Agreement was based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of the common stock during the term of the 2015 ASR Agreement, less an agreed discount. On September 25, 2015, the Company completed the 2015 ASR Agreement and received an additional 3.6 million shares of common stock. During 2015, the Company incurred costs of $0.1 million in connection with the 2015 ASR Agreement, which were recorded to treasury stock.\nBased upon current levels of operations, the Company expects that available cash and cash flows from operations will provide sufficient liquidity to meet operating cash requirements for the next 12 months.\nCash used in financing activities increased $228.7 million during 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to a net decrease in cash provided by long-term debt activities of $949.6 million resulting from the securitized financing facility and the related repayment of the 2013 Restated Credit Agreement during 2015. The unfavorable impact of long-term debt activities was partially offset by a decrease in repurchases of common stock of $761.8 million.\n\nRelated Party Transactions\n (a) Excludes the impact of the 53rd week in 2015. \nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt\n \u2022 potential stock repurchases of up to $150.0 million, of which $1.3 million was repurchased subsequent to January 1, 2017 through February 22, 2017 as discussed below in Stock Repurchases.\u201d \n \u2022 stock repurchases of $335.3 million \nCapitalization\n\nThe Wendy's Company's total capitalization at January 1, 2017 decreased $139.0 million from $3,179.0 million at January 3, 2016 and was impacted principally by the following:\nIn addition during 2012, Wendy's provided a $2.0 million guarantee to a lender for a franchisee, in connection with the refinancing of the franchisee's debt which originated in 2007. Pursuant to the agreement, the guarantee is subject to an annual reduction over a five year period. As of January 1, 2017, the guarantee totaled $1.3 million.\nOperating Activities\n (b) Excludes related sublease rental receipts of $750.6 million on capital lease obligations. The table includes interest of approximately $336.7 million for capital lease obligations. \n (c) The Company has outstanding letters of credit with various parties totaling $33.0 million, of which $6.2 million are cash collateralized. The Company does not expect any material loss to result from these letters of credit because we do not believe performance will be required. \nThe increase in franchise royalty revenue and fees during 2016 was primarily due to sales of Company-operated restaurants to franchisees and facilitating franchisee-to-franchisee restaurant transfers under our system optimization initiative. Royalty revenue also benefited from a 1.4% increase in franchise same-restaurant sales. These increases were partially offset by royalty revenue of approximately $6.0 million for the 53rd week of 2015.\nWendy's restaurant operations are moderately seasonal. Wendy's average restaurant sales are normally higher during the summer months than during the winter months. Because the business is moderately seasonal, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any other quarter or for the full fiscal year.\nCash provided by operating activities decreased $31.1 million during 2016 as compared to 2015, due to a decrease of $99.4 million in net income adjusted for non-cash expenses, partially offset by a favorable change in operating assets and liabilities of $68.3 million. The favorable change in operating assets and liabilities resulted from (1) an increase as a result of cash restricted for the payment of interest under our securitized financing facility during the second quarter of 2015, (2) an increase in real estate and property tax receivables in 2015 as a result of an increase in franchise restaurants in connection with our system optimization initiative and (3) a decrease in receivables for income tax refunds. These favorable changes were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a decrease in the incentive compensation accrual for the 2016 fiscal year due to weaker operating performance as compared to plan in 2016 versus 2015, as well as an increase in payments for the 2015 fiscal year.\nCash provided by investing activities increased $56.7 million during 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to (1) a decrease of $101.6 million in capital expenditures and (2) an increase of $57.8 million in proceeds from dispositions related to our system optimization initiative. These changes were partially offset by (1) a decrease of $78.4 million in proceeds from the sale of the Bakery in 2015 and (2) an increase in restricted cash for the reinvestment in capital assets under our securitized financing facility of $18.6 million.\n (b) Excludes Venezuela due to the impact of Venezuela's highly inflationary economy. \nThe decrease in cost of sales, as a percent of sales, during 2015 was due to benefits from strategic price increases on our menu items and higher sales at our Image Activation restaurants. As a percent of sales, commodity costs were flat compared with prior year, as higher beef prices were offset by lower prices of other commodities. The impact of the 53rd week in 2015 on cost of sales, as a percent of sales, was not material.\nOn July 4, 2011, Wendy's Restaurants completed the sale of 100% of the common stock of its then wholly-owned subsidiary, Arby's Restaurant Group, Inc. ( Arby's\u201d) to ARG IH Corporation ( ARG\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ARG Holding Corporation ( ARG Parent\u201d), for $130.0 million in cash (subject to customary purchase price adjustments) and 18.5% of the common stock of ARG Parent (through which Wendy's Restaurants indirectly retained an 18.5% interest in Arby's). The Company received a $54.9 million dividend from our investment in Arby's in 2015, which was recognized in Investment income, net.\u201d\nThe Wendy's Company is the parent company of its 100% owned subsidiary holding company, Wendy's Restaurants, LLC ( Wendy's Restaurants\u201d). The principal 100% owned subsidiary of Wendy's Restaurants is Wendy's International, LLC and its subsidiaries ( Wendy's\u201d). Wendy's franchises and operates Wendy's\u00ae quick-service restaurants specializing in hamburger sandwiches throughout North America (defined as the United States of America (the U.S.\u201d) and Canada). Wendy's also has franchised restaurants in 29 foreign countries and U.S. territories.\nThe decrease in general and administrative expenses during 2016 was primarily due to decreases in (1) employee compensation and related expenses primarily as a result of changes in staffing driven by our system optimization initiative and (2) incentive compensation accruals due to a decrease in operating performance as compared to plan in 2016 versus 2015. These decreases in general and administrative expenses were partially offset by increases in (1) severance expense, (2) legal reserves and (3) professional services due to legal and other costs associated with the cybersecurity incident (see Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information).\nOur effective tax rates in 2016, 2015, and 2014 were impacted by variations in income from continuing operations before income taxes, adjusted for recurring items such as non-deductible expenses and state income taxes, as well as non-recurring discrete items. Discrete items, which may occur in any given year but are not consistent from year to year include the following: (1) the impact of our system optimization initiative further described below, (2) valuation allowances which decreased in 2016 and increased in 2015 and 2014 primarily as a result of changes in expected future state taxable income available to offset certain state net operating loss carryforwards (including a correction to a prior year identified and recorded in the first quarter of 2016, which resulted in a benefit of $2.9 million) and (3) a deduction for a dividend received in 2015 from our investment in Arby's.\n\n\n\n\n\nSecuritized Financing Facility\nIntroduction\nSystem Optimization Initiative\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions in applying our critical accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our estimates and assumptions affect, among other things, impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, impairment of long-lived assets, restaurant dispositions, realizability of deferred tax assets, Federal and state income tax uncertainties and legal and environmental accruals. We evaluate those estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based on historical experience and on various other factors which we believe are reasonable under the circumstances.\nThe tables included throughout Results of Operations set forth in millions the Company's consolidated results of operations for the years ended January 1, 2017, January 3, 2016 and December 28, 2014 (except average unit volumes, which are in thousands).\n \u2022 Legal and environmental accruals: \nDeferred income taxes are not recorded for temporary differences related to our investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries which we consider permanently invested outside of the U.S. At January 1, 2017, our cash balances held outside of the U.S. totaled $97.8 million.\nExecutive Overview\n \u2022 capital lease obligations of $104.1 million; \nwe select as guideline companies are engaged in a similar line of business or are subject to similar financial and business risks, including the opportunity for growth. The guideline company method of the market approach provides an indication of value by relating the equity or invested capital (debt plus equity) of guideline companies to various measures of their earnings and cash flow, then applying such multiples to the business being valued. The result of applying the guideline company approach is adjusted based on the incremental value associated with a controlling interest in the business. This control premium\u201d represents the amount a new controlling shareholder would pay for the benefits resulting from synergies and other potential benefits derived from controlling the enterprise.\nOur primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our securitized financing facility. Principal uses of cash are operating expenses, capital expenditures, repurchases of common stock and dividends to shareholders.\nDeferred tax assets are recognized to the extent the Company believes these assets will more likely than not be realized. In evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including the interaction and the timing of future reversals of existing temporary differences, recent operating results, tax-planning strategies, and projected future taxable income. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results from continuing operations and incorporate assumptions including future operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage our underlying business. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income.\n\n \u2022 dividends paid of $63.8 million \nThe increase in franchise rental expense during 2016 and 2015 was primarily due to subleasing properties to franchisees that were previously Company-operated restaurants and as such, had been previously recorded in cost of sales. Rental expense in 2016 and 2015 also increased as a result of entering into new leases in connection with facilitating franchisee-to-franchisee restaurant transfers for purposes of subleasing such properties to the franchisee.\n\nOur Continuing Business\nThe estimated fair values of our goodwill reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to change as a result of many factors including, among others, any changes in our business plans, changing economic conditions and the competitive environment. Should actual cash flows and our future estimates vary adversely from those estimates we use, we may be required to recognize impairment charges in future years.\nWendy's has a purchasing co-op relationship agreement (the Wendy's Co-op\u201d) with its franchisees which establishes Quality Supply Chain Co-op, Inc. ( QSCC\u201d). QSCC manages, for the Wendy's system in the U.S. and Canada, contracts for the purchase and distribution of food, proprietary paper, operating supplies and equipment under national agreements with pricing based upon total system volume. QSCC's supply chain management facilitates continuity of supply and provides consolidated purchasing efficiencies while monitoring and seeking to minimize possible obsolete inventory throughout the Wendy's supply chain in the U.S. and Canada.\nThe following table summarizes the expected payments under our outstanding contractual obligations at January 1, 2017:\nThe impact of our system optimization initiative on the provision for income taxes included the effects of the disposition of non-deductible goodwill (including a correction to a prior year identified and recorded in the first quarter of 2016, which resulted in a benefit of $4.2 million), and changes to our state deferred taxes and valuation allowances on state net operating losses caused\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWendy's executed an agreement in 2013 to partner with a third-party lender to establish a financing program for franchisees that participate in our Image Activation program. Under the program, the lender agreed to provide loans to franchisees to be used for the reimaging of restaurants according to the guidelines and specifications under Wendy's Image Activation program. To support the program, Wendy's provided to the lender a $6.0 million irrevocable stand-by letter of credit, which was issued on July 1, 2013 and was cash collateralized. During 2016, the Company executed an agreement to terminate the letter of credit agreement that had been previously executed as part of the financing program.\nNet operating loss and credit carryforwards are subject to various limitations and carryforward periods. As of January 1, 2017, we have foreign tax credits of $21.7 million and state tax credits of $0.5 million, which will begin to expire in 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition, as of January 1, 2017, we have state net operating loss carryforwards of $779.8 million, which began expiring in 2017. We believe it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits will not be realized. In recognition of this risk, we have provided a valuation allowance of $11.4 million.\n \u2022 repayments of long-term debt of $24.6 million; partially offset by \n \u2022 Impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets: \n\n \u2022 treasury share issuances of $32.7 million for exercises and vestings of share-based compensation awards. \n\n\nGeneral and Administrative ( G&A\u201d) Realignment\nEffective January 1, 2011, Wendy's leased 14,333 square feet of office space to QSCC for an annual base rental of $0.2 million. The lease expired on December 31, 2016. A new lease agreement was signed effective January 1, 2017, expiring on December 31, 2020 for an annual base rental of $0.2 million. The Wendy's Company received $0.2 million of lease income from QSCC each year during 2016, 2015 and 2014, which has been recorded as a reduction of General and administrative.\u201d\nCash used in financing activities decreased $198.8 million during 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to a net increase in cash provided by long-term debt activities of $961.3 million resulting from the securitized financing facility and the related repayment of the 2013 Restated Credit Agreement. The favorable impact of long-term debt activities was partially offset by an increase in repurchases of common stock of $797.5 million.\nWendy's and its franchisees pay sourcing fees to third-party vendors on certain products sourced by QSCC. Such sourcing fees are remitted by these vendors to QSCC and are the primary means of funding QSCC's operations. Should QSCC's sourcing fees exceed its expected needs, QSCC's board of directors may return some or all of the excess to its members in the form of a patronage dividend. Wendy's recorded its share of patronage dividends of $0.9 million, $1.3 million and $1.5 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which are included as a reduction of Cost of sales.\u201d\n\n\nDuring 2014, the Company repurchased 3.0 million shares with an aggregate purchase price of $23.9 million, excluding commissions of $0.1 million, as part of the August 2014 authorization. In January 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program, which the Company fully utilized through completion of a modified Dutch auction tender offer on February 19, 2014 resulting in 29.7 million shares repurchased for an aggregate purchase price of $275.0 million. The Company incurred costs of $2.3 million in connection with the tender offer, which were recorded to treasury stock.\n\nResults of Operations\nThe tables below present key business measures which are defined and further discussed in the Executive Overview\u201d section included here-in.\nDuring 2015, the Company recognized a gain on the disposal of the Bakery of $10.6 million, net of income tax expense of $14.9 million which has been included in net income from discontinued operations. The provision for income taxes on the gain on disposal includes the impact of non-deductible goodwill disposed of as a result of the sale.\nCash Flows\nThe tables included throughout Liquidity and Capital Resources present dollars in millions.\nAs a result of the sale of the Bakery discussed above in Executive Overview - Sale of the Bakery,\u201d the Bakery's results of operations for the period from December 29, 2014 through May 31, 2015 and for the year ended 2014 have been included in Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes\u201d in the table below.\n (a) Wendy's is contingently liable for certain leases and other obligations primarily from former Company-operated restaurant locations now operated by franchisees amounting to $62.9 million as of January 1, 2017. These leases extend through 2050. In addition, Wendy's is contingently liable for certain other leases which have been assigned to unrelated third parties, who have indemnified Wendy's against future liabilities amounting to $0.7 million as of January 1, 2017. These leases expire on various dates through 2021. \nOutlook for 2017\nSupply Chain Relationship Agreement\nThe Company manages and internally reports its business geographically. The operation and franchising of Wendy's restaurants in North America comprises virtually all of our current operations and represents a single reportable segment. The revenues and operating results of Wendy's restaurants outside of North America are not material. The results of operations discussed below may not necessarily be indicative of future results.\n\nincrease in customer count. The customer count increase for the year was driven by significantly higher customer transactions during the fourth quarter of 2015, which resulted in a Company-operated same-restaurant sales increase of 3.7% during the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Sales during 2015 were negatively impacted by $7.4 million due to changes in Canadian foreign currency rates relative to the U.S. dollar.\n (b) Includes international franchised restaurants same-restaurant sales (excluding Venezuela due to the impact of Venezuela's highly inflationary economy). \n (d) Includes (1) $49.3 million for the remaining beverage purchase requirement under a beverage agreement, (2) $11.3 million for capital expenditures, (3) $2.4 million for utility commitments and (4) $0.5 million of other purchase obligations. \nLong-Term Debt, Including Current Portion\nThe changes in impairment charges were primarily driven by variations in losses from the remeasurement of properties to fair value upon determination that the assets will be leased and/or subleased to franchisees in connection with the sale of Company-operated restaurants. Such impairment charges totaled $14.0 million, $19.2 million and $12.0 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Impairment of long-lived assets also decreased during 2016 due to lower impairment charges resulting from closing Company-operated restaurants and classifying such surplus properties as held for sale.\n \u2022 Income tax uncertainties: \nOn June 1, 2015, the Company completed a $2,275.0 million securitized financing facility, which consists of the following: $875.0 million of 3.371%, $900.0 million of 4.080% and $500.0 million of 4.497% Series 2015-1 fixed rate senior secured notes (collectively, the Series 2015-1 Class A-2 Notes\u201d). In addition, the Company entered into a purchase agreement for the issuance of Series 2015-1 variable funding senior secured notes, Class A-1 (the Series 2015-1 Class A-1 Notes\u201d and, together with the Series 2015-1 Class A-2 Notes, the Series 2015-1 Senior Notes\u201d), which allows for the issuance of up to $150.0 million of variable funding notes and certain other credit instruments, including letters of credit. The proceeds from the issuance of the Series 2015-1 Class A-2 Notes, were used to repay all amounts outstanding on the Term A Loans and Term B Loans under the Company's May 16, 2013 Restated Credit Agreement amended on September 24, 2013 (the 2013 Restated Credit Agreement\u201d). In connection with the repayment of the Term A Loans and Term B Loans, the Company terminated the related interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $350.0 million and $100.0 million, respectively, which had been designated as cash flow hedges. As a result, the Company recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $7.3 million during the second quarter of 2015, primarily consisting of the write-off of deferred costs related to the 2013 Restated Credit Agreement of $7.2 million and fees paid to terminate the related interest rate swaps of $0.1 million.\n327 and 255 Company-operated restaurants to franchisees, respectively, which included the sale of all of its Company-operated restaurants in Canada. The Company recognized net gains totaling $71.9 million, $74.0 million and $91.5 million on the sale of Company-operated restaurants and other assets during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which were recorded to System optimization gains, net\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations. In addition, the Company facilitated the transfer of 144 and 71 restaurants between franchisees during 2016 and 2015, respectively. With the sale of 310 restaurants during 2016, the Company completed its plan to reduce its Company-operated restaurant ownership to approximately 5% as of January 1, 2017. Wendy's will continue to optimize its system by facilitating franchisee-to-franchisee transfers of restaurants, as well as evaluating strategic acquisitions of franchised restaurants and strategic dispositions of Company-operated restaurants to existing and new franchisees, to further strengthen the franchisee base, drive new restaurant development and accelerate Image Activation adoption.\n\n \u2022 capital expenditures of approximately $85.0 million as discussed below in Capital Expenditures;\u201d \nSale of Arby's\nDuring 2015, the Company incurred a loss on the early extinguishment of debt as a result of repaying all amounts outstanding on the Term A Loans and Term B Loans under the 2013 Restated Credit Agreement, with the proceeds from its securitized financing facility. The loss on the early extinguishment of debt was primarily comprised of the write-off of deferred costs associated with the 2013 Restated Credit Agreement of $7.2 million and fees paid to terminate the related interest rate swaps of $0.1 million.\nInvesting Activities\nOn June 2, 2015, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement to repurchase our common stock from Nelson Peltz, Peter W. May (Messrs. Peltz and May are members of the Company's Board of Directors) and Edward P. Garden (who served on the Company's Board of Directors until December 14, 2015) and certain of their family members and affiliates, investment funds managed by Trian Fund Management, L.P. (an investment management firm controlled by Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden, TFM\u201d) and the general partner of certain of those funds (together with Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden, certain of their family members and affiliates and TFM, the Trian Group\u201d), who in the aggregate owned approximately 24.8% of the Company's outstanding shares as of May 29, 2015. Pursuant to the agreement, the Trian Group agreed not to tender or sell any of its shares in the modified Dutch auction tender offer the Company commenced on June 3, 2015. Also pursuant to the agreement, the Company agreed, following completion of the tender offer, to purchase from the Trian Group a pro rata amount of its shares based on the number of shares the Company purchased in the tender offer, at the same price received by shareholders who participated in the tender offer. On July 17, 2015, after completion of the modified Dutch auction tender offer, the Company repurchased 18.4 million shares of its common stock from the Trian Group at the price paid in the tender offer of $11.45 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $210.9 million.\nThe table below summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years:\nContractual Obligations\n (a) Excludes capital lease obligations, which are shown separately in the table. The table includes interest of approximately $522.9 million. These amounts exclude the fair value adjustment related to Wendy's 7% debentures assumed in the Wendy's merger. \n (c) Excludes the impact of the 53rd week in 2015. \nThe following table summarizes the Company's repurchases of common stock for 2016, 2015 and 2014:\n\nTimWen lease and management fee payments\nCash provided by operating activities decreased $42.3 million during 2015 as compared to 2014, due to an unfavorable change in operating assets and liabilities of $54.3 million, partially offset by an increase of $12.0 million in net income adjusted for non-cash expenses. The unfavorable change in operating assets and liabilities resulted from (1) an increase in receivables for income tax refunds, (2) an increase in royalty, rent and property tax receivables as a result of an increase in franchise restaurants in connection with our system optimization initiative and the impact of the 53rd week on royalty receivables and (3) an increase in restricted cash for the payment of interest under our securitized financing facility. These unfavorable changes were partially offset by the favorable impact of an increase in the incentive compensation accrual for the 2015 fiscal year due to stronger operating performance as compared to plan in 2015 versus 2014, as well as a decrease in payments for the 2014 fiscal year.\nWe expect that the sales trends for franchised restaurants will continue to be generally impacted by the factors described above under Sales\u201d related to the improvements in the North America business. The impact of Company-operated restaurants sold to franchisees in 2016 and facilitating franchisee-to-franchisee restaurant transfers under our system optimization initiative will continue to result in increased franchise royalty revenue and fees and franchise rental income.\nThe increase in franchise rental income during 2016 and 2015 was primarily due to leasing and/or subleasing properties to franchisees in connection with the sale of Company-operated restaurants and facilitating franchisee-to-franchisee restaurant transfers.\nSales\nThe non-GAAP financial measures discussed above do not replace the presentation of the Company's financial results in accordance with GAAP. Because all companies do not calculate non-GAAP financial measures in the same way, these measures as used by other companies may not be consistent with the way the Company calculates such measures.\nInflation and Changing Prices\nDepreciation and Amortization\nSeasonality\nOur annual impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets was completed through a qualitative assessment performed in the fourth quarter of 2016, which indicated the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets was more likely than not greater than the carrying amount. The Company last completed a quantitative assessment in the fourth quarter of 2015, which indicated the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets significantly exceeded the carrying amount.\nThe improvement in cost of sales, as a percent of sales, during 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in commodity costs, reflecting lower beef prices. In addition, the increase in same-restaurant sales and higher sales at our new and remodeled Image Activation restaurants contributed to the improvement in cost of sales, as a percent of sales. These decreases in cost of sales, as a percent of sales, were partially offset by (1) higher medical insurance costs, (2) increased labor rates and (3) the negative impact of changes in product mix.\nWe expect sales will be favorably impacted primarily by improving our North America business through continuing core menu improvement, product innovation and focused execution of operational excellence and brand positioning. In addition, sales are expected to benefit from higher sales growth at our new and remodeled Image Activation restaurants. The impact of Wendy's restaurants sold in 2016 will continue to result in decreased sales.\nFor goodwill impairment testing purposes, Wendy's includes two reporting units comprised of its (1) North America (defined as the United States of America and Canada) Company-operated and franchise restaurants and (2) international franchise restaurants. As of January 1, 2017, all of Wendy's goodwill of $741.4 million was associated with its North America restaurants since its international franchise restaurants goodwill was determined to be fully impaired during the fourth quarter of 2013.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWendy's long-term growth opportunities will be driven by a combination of brand relevance and economic relevance. Key components of growth include (1) systemwide same-restaurant sales growth through continuing core menu improvement, product innovation and customer count growth, (2) investing in our Image Activation program, which includes innovative exterior and interior restaurant designs for our new and reimaged restaurants and focused execution of operational excellence, (3) growth in new restaurants, including global growth, (4) increased restaurant utilization in various dayparts and brand access utilizing mobile technology, (5) building shareholder value through financial management strategies and (6) our system optimization initiative.\nCash provided by operating activities was $181.4 million, $212.5 million and $254.8 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net income, adjusted for non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization, deferred income tax and share-based compensation, and the net change in operating assets and liabilities.\nKey Business Measures\nWe are involved in litigation and claims incidental to our current and prior businesses, including the legal proceedings related to a cybersecurity incident as described in Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d We provide accruals for such litigation and claims when payment is probable and reasonably estimable. As of January 1, 2017, the Company had accruals for all of its legal and environmental matters aggregating $1.2 million. Most proceedings are in preliminary stages, with various motions either yet to be submitted or pending, discovery yet to occur and significant factual matters unresolved. In addition, most cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages and many involve multiple parties. Predicting the outcomes of settlement discussions or judicial or arbitral decisions are thus inherently difficult. We review our assumptions and estimates each quarter based on new developments, changes in applicable law and other relevant factors and revise our accruals accordingly.\n \u2022 Our ability to realize deferred tax assets: \nThere were no material changes to the terms of any debt obligations since January 3, 2016. See Note 11 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Item 8 herein, for further information related to our long-term debt obligations.\nThe decrease in sales during 2016 was primarily due to the impact of Wendy's Company-operated restaurants sold under our system optimization initiative, which resulted in a reduction in sales of $560.0 million. In addition, 2016 included one less week of sales when compared to 2015, which resulted in a reduction in sales of $19.2 million. Company-operated same-restaurant sales during 2016 increased 2.7% primarily due to an increase in customer count. Sales also benefited from higher sales growth at our new and remodeled Image Activation restaurants.\nThe increase in other operating income, net during 2016 was primarily due to a gain recognized on a lease buyout during the first quarter of 2016. In addition, 2016 includes costs incurred to provide customer care and help desk support services to our franchisees. The decrease in other operating income, net during 2015 was primarily due to lower equity in earnings in joint ventures.\n\nThe decrease in distributions, including dividends in 2016 was primarily a result of a $54.9 million dividend we received in 2015 from our investment in Arby's.\nThe Company's fiscal reporting periods consist of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Sunday closest to December 31 and are referred to herein as (1) the year ended January 1, 2017\u201d or 2016,\u201d which consisted of 52 weeks, (2) the year ended January 3, 2016\u201d or 2015,\u201d which consisted of 53 weeks, and (3) the year ended December 28, 2014\u201d or 2014,\u201d which consisted of 52 weeks. All references to years and quarters relate to fiscal periods rather than calendar periods.\nWe review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of our long-lived assets by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated through leases and/or subleases or by our individual Company-operated restaurants. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, then impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is included in Impairment of long-lived assets.\u201d Our critical estimates in this review process include the anticipated future cash flows from leases and/or subleases or individual Company-operated restaurants, which is used in assessing the recoverability of the respective long-lived assets. Our impairment losses principally reflect impairment charges resulting from leasing and/or subleasing long-lived assets to franchisees in connection with the sale or anticipated sale of restaurants.\n_____________________\n (b) Wendy's provides loan guarantees to various lenders on behalf of franchisees under debt arrangements for new restaurant development and equipment financing to promote systemwide initiatives. Recourse on the majority of these loans is limited, generally to a percentage of the original loan amount or the current loan balance on individual franchisee loans or an aggregate minimum for the entire loan arrangement. \nOur indefinite-lived intangible assets represent trademarks and totaled $903.0 million as of January 1, 2017. We test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. Our annual impairment test may be completed through a qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount. If we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment, or if a qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the estimated carrying value exceeds the fair value, we test for impairment using a quantitative process. Our quantitative process includes comparing the carrying value to the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, with any excess recognized as an impairment loss. Our critical estimates in the determination of the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets include the anticipated future revenues of Company-operated and franchised restaurants and the resulting cash flows.\nAs of January 1, 2017, the net carrying value of our long-lived tangible and definite-lived intangible assets were $1,192.3 million and $419.5 million, respectively. Our long-lived assets include (1) properties and related definite-lived intangible assets (e.g., favorable leases) that are leased and/or subleased to franchisees and (2) Company-operated restaurant assets and related definite-lived intangible assets, which include favorable leases and reacquired rights under franchise agreements.\nUnder the market approach, we apply the guideline company method in estimating fair value. The guideline company method makes use of market price data of corporations whose stock is actively traded in a public market. The corporations\nCitationAir Aircraft Lease Agreement\n \u2022 quarterly cash dividends aggregating up to approximately $69.1 million as discussed below in Dividends;\u201d and \n\n________________\nWe believe that the following represent our more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\n \u2022 Restaurant Margin - We define restaurant margin as sales from Company-operated restaurants less cost of sales divided by sales from Company-operated restaurants. Cost of sales includes food and paper, restaurant labor and occupancy, advertising and other operating costs. Restaurant margin is influenced by factors such as restaurant openings and closures, price increases, the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing initiatives, featured products, product mix, the level of our fixed and semi-variable costs and fluctuations in food and labor costs. \nIn order to promote Image Activation new restaurant development, Wendy's has an incentive program for franchisees that provides for reductions in royalty and national advertising payments for up to the first two years of operation for qualifying new restaurants opened by December 31, 2020, with the value of the incentives declining in the later years of the program. Wendy's also has incentive programs for 2017 available to franchisees that commence Image Activation restaurant remodels by December 15, 2017. The remodel incentive programs provide for reductions in royalty payments for one year after the completion of construction.\nCapital Expenditures\nSale of the Bakery\n\nAlso as part of the June 2015 authorization, the Company repurchased 2.1 million shares during 2015 with an aggregate purchase price of $22.0 million, of which $1.7 million was accrued at January 3, 2016 and excluding commissions.\n \u2022 Average Unit Volumes - We calculate Company-operated restaurant average unit volumes by summing the average weekly sales of all Company-operated restaurants which reported sales during the week.  Franchised restaurant average unit volumes is a non-GAAP financial measure, which includes sales by franchised restaurants, which are reported by our franchisees and represent their revenues from sales at franchised Wendy's restaurants. The Company's consolidated financial statements do not include sales by franchised restaurants to their customers. The Company believes franchised restaurant average unit volumes is useful information for the same reasons described above for Systemwide Sales.\u201d We calculate franchised restaurant average unit volumes by summing the average weekly sales of all franchised restaurants which reported sales during the week.\nDuring 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company sold 310, 327 and 255 Company-operated restaurants to franchisees, respectively, under its system optimization initiative. System optimization gains, net in 2014 includes the impact of recording net favorable lease assets of $36.3 million as a result of leasing and/or subleasing land, buildings, and/or leasehold improvements to franchisees, in connection with the sales of restaurants. See Note 2 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Item 8 herein for further discussion.\nIn July 2013, the Company announced a system optimization initiative, as part of its brand transformation, which includes a shift from Company-operated restaurants to franchised restaurants over time, through acquisitions and dispositions, as well as helping to facilitate franchisee-to-franchisee restaurant transfers. In February 2015, the Company announced plans to sell approximately 540 additional restaurants to franchisees and reduce its ongoing Company-operated restaurant ownership to approximately 5% of the total system by the end of 2016. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company completed the sale of 310,\nFranchise Royalty Revenue and Fees and Franchise Rental Income\nThe increase in franchise royalty revenue and fees during 2015 was primarily due to sales of Company-operated restaurants to franchisees and facilitating franchisee-to-franchisee restaurant transfers under our system optimization initiative. Royalty revenue was also positively impacted by an increase in franchise same-restaurant sales, which excludes sales during the 53rd week of 2015. We believe franchise same-restaurant sales were higher than Company-operated same-restaurant sales during 2015 due to higher price increases. Royalty revenue also includes approximately $6.0 million for the 53rd week of 2015.\nIn 2016, cash capital expenditures amounted to $150.0 million and non-cash capital expenditures, consisting of capitalized lease obligations, amounted to $104.1 million. In 2017, we expect that cash capital expenditures will amount to approximately $85.0 million, principally relating to (1) reimaging Company-operated restaurants, (2) the opening of new Image Activation Company-operated restaurants, (3) technology, including consumer-facing restaurant technology, (4) maintenance capital expenditures for our Company-operated restaurants and (5) various other capital projects. As of January 1, 2017, the Company had $11.3 million of outstanding commitments, included in Accounts payable,\u201d for capital expenditures expected to be paid in 2017.\nFranchisee Incentive Programs\nThe decrease in general and administrative expenses during 2015 was primarily due to (1) a decrease in share-based compensation primarily as a result of awards granted and timing of expense recognition, (2) a decrease in franchise incentives due to the 2015 Image Activation incentive program solely including royalty reductions as compared to our 2014 program which also included a cash incentive and (3) a decrease in employee compensation and related expenses primarily as a result of the realignment of our U.S. field operations and Restaurant Support Center in Dublin, Ohio as part of our G&A realignment plan to reduce general and administrative expenses. These decreases were partially offset by higher incentive compensation accruals due to stronger operating performance as compared to plan in 2015 versus 2014.\nGuarantees and Other Contingencies\nfuture estimates vary adversely from those estimates we used, we may be required to recognize additional impairment charges in future years.\n \u2022 tax benefit from share-based compensation of $3.3 million; and \nThe Company participates in the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS\u201d) Compliance Assurance Process ( CAP\u201d). As part of CAP, tax years are examined on a contemporaneous basis so that all or most issues are resolved prior to the filing of the tax return. As such, our tax returns for fiscal years 2009 through 2015 have been settled. Certain of the Company's state income tax returns from its 2012 fiscal year and forward remain subject to examination. We believe that adequate provisions have been made for any liabilities, including interest and penalties that may result from the completion of these examinations.\nWe expect franchise rental expense to continue to increase due to subleasing properties to franchisees that were previously Company-operated restaurants in 2016 and as such, had been previously recorded in cost of sales.\n (e) Excludes obligation for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, of $21.5 million. We are unable to predict when and if cash payments will be required. \nWendy's operating results are impacted by a number of external factors, including unemployment, general economic trends, intense price competition, commodity costs, labor costs and weather.\nWendy's revenues for 2016 include: (1) $920.8 million of sales at Company-operated restaurants, (2) $371.5 million of royalty revenue and fees and (3) $143.1 million of franchise rental income. In 2016, substantially all of our Wendy's royalty agreements provided for royalties of 4.0% of franchise revenues.\nFranchisee Image Activation Incentive Programs\nThe decrease in restaurant depreciation and amortization during 2016 was primarily due to decreases in (1) depreciation on assets sold or classified as held for sale under our system optimization initiative of $19.5 million and (2) accelerated depreciation on existing assets that are being replaced as part of our Image Activation program of $6.0 million.\nWe expect cost of sales, as a percent of sales, will be favorably impacted by the same factors described above for sales. We expect these favorable impacts on cost of sales, as a percent of sales, to be offset by higher restaurant labor due to increases in wages.\n \u2022 Impairment of long-lived assets: \nAs of January 1, 2017, the Wendy's restaurant system was comprised of 6,537 restaurants, of which 330 were owned and operated by the Company. All of our Company-operated restaurants are located in the U.S. as a result of the Company completing its initiative during the second quarter of 2015 to sell all Company-operated restaurants in Canada to franchisees.\nAs a result of the sale of the Bakery as discussed above in Executive Overview - Sale of the Bakery,\u201d the Bakery's results of operations for the period from December 29, 2014 through May 31, 2015 and for the year ended 2014 have been included in Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes\u201d in the table above. 2015 includes a reduction to cost of sales of $12,486 resulting from the reversal of a liability recorded during 2013 associated with the Bakery's withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan. See Note 19 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Item 8 herein for further discussion.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2017, our effective tax rate will be impacted by the adoption of an amendment issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d), which will require that excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to share based payments be recognized in net income. See Note 1 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Item 8 herein for further discussion.\nWhen considered necessary, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the deferred tax assets to their anticipated realizable value. Our evaluation of the realizability of our deferred tax assets is subject to change as a result of many factors including, among others, any changes in our business plans, changing economic conditions, the competitive environment and the effect of future tax legislation. Should future taxable income vary from projected taxable income, we may be required to adjust our valuation allowance in future years.\nOur annual goodwill impairment test was completed through a qualitative assessment performed in the fourth quarter of 2016, which indicated the fair value of goodwill of our Wendy's North America restaurants was more likely than not greater than the carrying amount. The Company last completed a quantitative assessment in the fourth quarter of 2015, which indicated the fair value of goodwill of our Wendy's North America restaurants significantly exceeded the carrying amount.\n (a) Excludes commissions of $0.3 million, $2.4 million and $2.3 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. \n\nCosts related to our system optimization initiative are recorded to Reorganization and realignment costs.\u201d During 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company recognized costs totaling $9.4 million, $11.6 million and $19.0 million, respectively, which primarily included severance and related employee costs, accelerated depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense and professional fees. The Company expects to incur additional costs, primarily comprised of professional fees, of approximately $1.3 million during 2017 in connection with an in-process transaction as of January 1, 2017. Costs incurred during 2017 related to facilitating franchisee-to-franchisee transfers of restaurants will be recorded to Other operating income, net.\u201d\nNew Accounting Standards\n (d) The decrease in average unit volumes for international franchised restaurants is primarily driven by changes in the countries and territories in which the franchised restaurants operate, as well as the impact of foreign currency translation. \nWe expect depreciation and amortization will slightly decrease primarily as a result of reducing our mix of Company-operated restaurants to franchise restaurants through our system optimization initiative. As a result, we also expect accelerated depreciation and depreciation for new and reimaged restaurants under our Image Activation program to decrease.\nCybersecurity Incident\nDuring 2014, Wendy's provided a C$2.3 million ($1.7 million as of January 1, 2017) guarantee to a lender on behalf of a franchisee, in connection with the sale of restaurants to the franchisee under the Company's system optimization initiative. As a result, the total amount of the guarantee was recorded as a deferred gain in 2014 and is included in Other liabilities.\u201d\nIn August 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program for up to $100.0 million of our common stock through December 31, 2015, when and if market conditions warrant and to the extent legally permissible. As part of the August 2014 authorization, $76.1 million remained available as of December 28, 2014. During the first and second quarters of 2015, the Company repurchased 5.7 million shares with an aggregate purchase price of $61.6 million, excluding commissions of $0.1 million. During the third quarter of 2015, the Company repurchased $14.5 million through the 2015 ASR Agreement described above. As a result, the $100.0 million share repurchase program authorized in August 2014 was completed.\nThe Company first reported unusual payment card activity affecting some franchise-owned restaurants in February 2016 and that malware had been discovered on certain systems. Subsequently, on June 9, 2016, the Company reported that an additional malware variant had been identified and disabled. On July 7, 2016, the Company, on behalf of affected franchise locations, provided information about specific restaurant locations that may have been impacted by these attacks, all of which are located in the United States, along with support for customers who may have been affected by the malware variants. See Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nThe Wendy's Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, was party to a three-year aircraft management and lease agreement, which expired in March 2014, with CitationAir, a subsidiary of Cessna Aircraft Company, pursuant to which the Company leased a corporate aircraft to CitationAir to use as part of its Jet Card program fleet. During the first quarter of 2014, our Chairman, who was our former Chief Executive Officer, and our Vice Chairman, who was our former President and Chief Operating Officer (the Former Executives\u201d) and a director, who was our former Vice Chairman, and members of their immediate families, used their Jet Card agreements for business and personal travel on aircraft in the Jet Card program fleet. A management company formed by the Former Executives and a director (the Management Company\u201d) paid CitationAir directly, and the Company received credit from CitationAir for charges related to such travel of approximately $0.4 million during 2014.\nIn November 2014, the Company initiated a plan to reduce its general and administrative expenses. The plan included a realignment and reinvestment of resources to focus primarily on accelerated restaurant development and consumer-facing restaurant technology to drive long-term growth. The Company achieved the majority of the expense reductions through the realignment of its U.S. field operations and savings at its Restaurant Support Center in Dublin, Ohio, which was substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of 2015. Costs related to G&A realignment are recorded to Reorganization and realignment costs.\u201d The Company recognized costs totaling $0.7 million, $10.3 million and $12.9 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which primarily included severance and related employee costs, share-based compensation and recruitment and relocation costs. No additional costs are expected to be incurred under the G&A realignment plan.\nIn addition, Wendy's had incentive programs that included reductions in royalty payments in 2016, 2015 and 2014 as well as cash incentives for franchisees' participation in Wendy's Image Activation program throughout 2014. The Company recognized expense of $4.4 million for cash incentives in General and administrative\u201d during 2014.\nStock Repurchases\nDuring 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company recognized costs associated with its G&A realignment plan totaling $0.7 million, $10.3 million and $12.9 million, respectively. During 2016, costs primarily included recruitment and relocation costs. In 2015, costs primarily included (1) share-based compensation expense of $5.6 million, (2) severance and related employee costs of $3.0 million and (3) recruitment and relocation costs of $1.7 million. During 2014, the Company recorded costs aggregating $12.9 million, which primarily included severance and related employee costs.\nStock Purchase Agreement\nDividends\n \u2022 Systemwide Sales - Systemwide sales is a non-GAAP financial measure, which includes sales by both Company-operated restaurants and franchised restaurants. Franchised restaurants' sales are reported by our franchisees and represent their revenues from sales at franchised Wendy's restaurants. The Company's consolidated financial statements do not include sales by franchised restaurants to their customers. The Company believes systemwide sales data is useful in assessing consumer demand for the Company's products, the overall success of the Wendy's brand and, ultimately, the performance of the Company. The Company's royalty revenues are computed as percentages of sales made by Wendy's franchisees. As a result, sales by Wendy's franchisees have a direct effect on the Company's royalty revenues and therefore on the Company's profitability.  The Company reviews systemwide sales for its international franchised restaurants on a constant currency basis. Constant currency results exclude the impact of foreign currency translation and are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. The Company believes excluding the impact of foreign currency translation provides better year over year comparability.\nFranchisee Image Activation Financing Program\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of The Wendy's Company ( The Wendy's Company\u201d and, together with its subsidiaries, the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d or our\u201d) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere within this report. Certain statements we make under this Item 7 constitute forward-looking statements\u201d under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Projections\u201d in Part I\u201d preceding Item 1 - Business.\u201d You should consider our forward-looking statements in light of the risks discussed under the heading Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A above, as well as our consolidated financial statements, related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe income approach, which considers factors unique to each of our reporting units and related long range plans that may not be comparable to other companies and that are not yet publicly available, is dependent on several critical management assumptions. These assumptions include estimates of future sales growth, gross margins, operating costs, income tax rates, terminal value growth rates, capital expenditures and the weighted average cost of capital (discount rate). Anticipated cash flows used under the income approach are developed every fourth quarter in conjunction with our annual budgeting process and also incorporate amounts and timing of future cash flows based on our long range plan.\n________________\nWe accrue interest related to uncertain tax positions in Interest expense\u201d and penalties in General and administrative.\u201d At January 1, 2017, we had $1.3 million accrued for interest and $0.6 million accrued for penalties.\nThe increase in interest expense during 2016 and 2015 was primarily a result of the Company completing a $2,275.0 million securitized financing facility on June 1, 2015. The proceeds were used to repay all amounts outstanding on the Term A Loans and Term B Loans under the Company's 2013 Restated Credit Agreement. The securitized financing facility includes the Series 2015-1 Class A-2 Notes, which are comprised of fixed interest rate notes, and the Series 2015-1 Class A-1 Notes, which allow for the issuance up to $150.0 million of variable funding notes. The principal amounts outstanding on the Series 2015-1 Class A-2 Notes significantly exceed the amounts that were outstanding on the Term A Loans and Term B Loans. In addition, the Series 2015-1 Class A-2 Notes bear fixed-rate interest at rates higher than our historical effective interest rates on our variable interest rate Term A Loans and Term B Loans.
