Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere herein.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a major supplier to the aerospace industry and have two reportable segments: (i) Systems & Support, whose companies' revenues are derived from integrated solutions, including design, development and support of proprietary components, subsystems and systems, production of complex assemblies using external designs, as well as full life cycle solutions for commercial, regional and military aircraft; and (ii) Aerospace Structures, whose companies supply commercial, business, regional, and military manufacturers with large metallic and composite structures and produce close-tolerance parts primarily to customer designs and model-based definition, including a wide range of aluminum, hard metal and composite structure capabilities.\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, we divested of a number of our assets and operations, including the transfer of the assets and certain liabilities associated with our Gulfstream G650 wing supply chain activities. Additionally, subsequent to March 31, 2021, we completed the sale of our composites manufacturing operations located in Milledgeville, Georgia, and Rayong, Thailand, as well as our manufacturing operations located in Red Oak, Texas. We recognized combined net losses of $104.7 million primarily from these transactions. These losses are presented on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations within loss on sale of assets and businesses, net. The operating results associated with the G650 wing supply chain activities and the composites and other manufacturing operations referred to above were included within Aerospace Structures through the date of transfer and through March 31, 2021, respectively. During the year ended March 31, 2021, these transactions represented, in the aggregate, approximately $266.2 million of the $1.87 billion of consolidated net sales (or approximately 14.2% of consolidated net sales).\nSignificant financial results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, include:\nTable 32: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Net sales for fiscal 2021 decreased 35.5% to $1.87 billion.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 33: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Operating loss for fiscal 2021 was $326.2 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 34: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Included in operating loss for fiscal 2021 was loss on sale of assets and businesses of $104.7 million and restructuring charges of $53.2 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 35: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Net loss for fiscal 2021 was $450.9 million or $8.55 per diluted common share.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 36: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Backlog decreased 41.6% over the prior year to $1.9 billion primarily due to the divestitures occurring in and subsequent to the year-ended March 31, 2021, which had backlog of approximately $684.3 million as of March 31, 2020.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur working capital needs are generally funded through cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit arrangements. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, we used $173.1 million of cash flows in operating activities, used $9.3 million in investing activities, and received $277.2 million from financing activities. Cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2020 were $96.7 million.\nWe have committed to several plans that incorporated the restructuring of certain of our businesses. As of March 31, 2021, with the exception of two pending facility closures to be completed in fiscal 2022 or 2023, we have substantially completed these plans.\nDuring late fiscal 2020, in response to anticipated market headwinds primarily arising from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we committed to new restructuring and cost reduction activities to align capacity with expected demand. These plans and related activities were implemented to generate savings of approximately $120.0 million in fiscal 2021 on a consolidated basis, primarily from headcount and other human resource related cost reductions. We achieved these savings goals for the year ended March 31, 2021.\nWhile the long-term outlook for the aerospace industry remains positive due the fundamental drivers of air travel demand, current expectations are that it will take 2-3 years for travel to return to calendar 2019 levels and a few years beyond that for the industry to return to long-term trend growth, although there can be no assurance that such period will not be longer. To balance the supply and demand given the COVID-19 shock and to preserve long-term potential and competitiveness, our customers have decided to reduce the production rates of several of their commercial aircraft programs. These rate decisions were based on assessments of the demand environment. There is uncertainty with respect to how commercial air traffic levels will recover, and whether and at what point capacity will return to and/or exceed pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. We continue to work with our customers to closely monitor the key factors that affect backlog and future demand including customers' evolving manufacturing plans, the widebody replacement cycle and the cargo market, but such impact could be material and make it difficult to compare periods.\nWe continue to expect the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce demand for commercial aviation aftermarket due to the recent sharp decreases in flights; as well as reduce demand for commercial aviation production as OEMs have lowered their related delivery rate assumptions. The COVID-19 pandemic related reduction in OEM production rates has resulted in additional costs to produce and deliver our products. While these costs were largely mitigated through our cost reduction initiatives during the year ended March 31, 2021, continued or further cost increases may not be mitigated through additional cost reduction initiatives and could negatively impact earnings and cash flows, particularly with respect to our fixed-price contracts.\nWe are unable at this time to reasonably estimate potential future additional financial impacts or a range of loss, if any, due to continued uncertainties related to the impacts of COVID-19 on our operations, supply chain and customers, future changes to OEM production rates, supply chain impacts, and/or the results of negotiations with particular customers. Any such impacts, including any changes in our estimates, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows.\nFor example, we expect that, in the event that our customers are unable to resume aircraft deliveries consistent with provided assumptions, the continued absence of revenue, earnings, and cash flows associated with those deliveries would continue to have a material impact on our operating results. In the event that future OEM production rate increases occur at a slower rate or take longer than we are currently assuming, we expect that the growth in inventory and other cash flow impacts associated with production would decrease. However, while any prolonged delays in planned OEM production rate increases could mitigate the impact on our liquidity, it could significantly increase the overall expected costs to manufacture our products, which would reduce operating margins and/or increase abnormal production costs in the future. Additionally, the declines in global air travel are expected to result in reduced demand for MRO services and uncertainty exists related to the length of time until air travel returns to historical levels.\nFrom fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2019, our Aerospace Structures business unit experienced operating and forward losses on our production of the Boeing 747-8 fuselage for Boeing, Gulfstream G280 wing for Israel Aerospace Industries, Ltd (\"IAI\") and Gulfstream G650 wing for Gulfstream. Further discussion is included below regarding the significant developments of each program as well as other significant programs.\nBoeing 737 MAX\nThe Boeing 737 MAX program represented approximately 3% of revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. During the third fiscal quarter of the year ended March 31, 2021, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Ag\u00eancia Nacional de Avia\u00e7\u00e3o Civil of Brazil approved the 737 MAX return to flight which was quickly followed by Transport Canada and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency in January 2021. Boeing resumed 737 MAX deliveries in our third fiscal quarter of the year ended March 31, 2021, delivering 27 aircraft. Conditions are expected to improve as COVID-19 vaccination distribution accelerates, and Boeing has projected further 737 MAX rate increases in the latter half of calendar year 2021. The International Air Transport Association has predicted a 55% increase in passengers traveling in 2021 to 2.8 billion passengers.\nBoeing has predicted that revenue passenger miles will return to 2019 levels in approximately two to three years. Boeing has planned 737 MAX gradual rate increases to 31 per month in early calendar year 2022 with further gradual increases corresponding with market demand. In January, Boeing stated that it has delivered more than 80 737 MAX airplanes since the FAA granted a return to flight and approximately 320 airplanes remain in inventory. Boeing has stated that the balance of 737 MAX airplanes produced during the grounding and included within inventory will be delivered by the close of calendar year 2022. While we expect to see gradual increases in 737 MAX revenue across both of our reportable segments in fiscal year 2022 based on these assumptions, a resurgence of COVID-19 that results in additional delays or shutdowns could degrade this expectation.\nBoeing 747-8\nAs of March 31, 2020, Triumph's production on this program has completed from its Hawthorne, California, facility, with the remaining production from its Grand Prairie, Texas, facility expected to be completed in early to mid-fiscal 2022. Facility exit plans are underway at both locations and are expected to result in additional cost to exit of approximately $7.5 million through mid-fiscal 2022 and result in projected cash uses.\nG280\nIn May 2020, we reached agreement to the accelerated transfer of the G280 wing program to IAI and Korean Aerospace Industries. We completed the final wing assembly in July 2020 and have closed our manufacturing operations at the leased Tulsa factory as of the end of October 2020.\nG650\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we reached an agreement with Gulfstream to optimize the supply chain on our G650 work scope. The G650 wing box and wing completion work, which had been coproduced across three facilities at both companies, are being consolidated into Gulfstream's facilities in Savannah, Georgia. We completed the manufacturing of our final wing box in July 2019. In August 2020, we completed the transfer of our remaining G650 wing supply chain activity and engineering services to Gulfstream. As a result of the divestiture of our composites manufacturing operations located in Milledgeville, Georgia, in May 2021, we no longer are responsible for the production of G650 wing components. We continue to produce G650 flaps under a separate supply agreement.\nT-7 Red Hawk\nThe T-7 Red Hawk wing and horizontal tail manufacturing operations were part of the sale of our Red Oak, Texas manufacturing operations which closed in May 2021. The related manufacturing operations did not have a significant impact on the results of our operations in the year ended March 31, 2021.\nAlthough none of the development or production programs noted above individually are expected to have a material impact on our net revenues, they do have the potential, either individually or in the aggregate, to materially and negatively impact our consolidated results of operations if future changes in estimates result in the need for a forward loss provision. Absent any such loss provisions, we do not anticipate that any of these programs will significantly dilute our future consolidated margins, although a prolonged impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in changes in expectations.\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, we divested of a number of our assets and operations, including the sale of our manufacturing operations at our Nashville, Tennessee, facility and the assignment of our E-2 Jets contract with Embraer for the manufacture of structural components for their program to AeroSpace Technologies of Korea Inc. (\"ASTK\"). We recognized combined net losses of $56.9 million associated with the fiscal 2020 divestitures, which are presented on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations within loss on sale of assets and businesses, net. The operating results of the Nashville manufacturing operations are included in Aerospace Structures through the date of divestiture or assignment. Collectively, these transactions are referred to as the fiscal 2020 divestitures.\u201d\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, we divested of a number of our assets and operations, including (i) selling all of the shares of Triumph Structures - East Texas, Inc. and all of the shares of Triumph Structures - Los Angeles, Inc. and Triumph Processing, Inc. (collectively, the \"Long & Large\"), (ii) transitioning the responsibility for the Bombardier Global 7500 (\"Global 7500\") wing program manufacturing operations of Aerospace Structures to Bombardier, (iii) selling all of the shares of Triumph Fabrications - San Diego, Inc. and Triumph Fabrications - Ft. Worth, Inc. (together, \"Fabrications\"), (iv) selling all of the shares of Triumph Structures - Kansas City, Inc., Triumph Structures - Wichita, Inc., Triumph Gear Systems - Toronto, ULC and Triumph Northwest (The Triumph Group Operations, Inc.) (together, \"Machining\"), and (v) selling all of the shares of Triumph Aviation Services - NAAS Division, Inc. (\"NAAS\"). Collectively, these transactions are referred to as the \"fiscal 2019 divestitures\". We recognized combined net losses of $235.3 million associated with the fiscal 2019 divestitures, which are presented on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations within loss on divestitures. With the exception of NAAS, the operating results for the fiscal 2019 divestitures are included in Aerospace Structures (\"fiscal 2019 Aerospace Structures Divestitures\") through the respective dates of divestiture. The operating results for NAAS are included in Systems & Support through the date of divestiture.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following includes a discussion of our consolidated and business segment results of operations. Our diverse structure and customer base do not provide for precise comparisons of the impact of price and volume changes to our results. However, we have disclosed the significant variances between the respective periods.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe prepare and publicly release annual audited and quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") rules, we also disclose and discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our public filings and earning releases. Currently, the non-GAAP financial measures that we disclose are Adjusted EBITDA, which is our net loss before interest, income taxes, amortization of acquired contract liabilities, legal settlements, loss on divestitures, depreciation and amortization; and Adjusted EBITDAP, which is Adjusted EBITDA, before pension expense or benefit, including the effects of curtailments, settlements, and other early retirement incentives. We disclose Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated and Adjusted EBITDAP on a consolidated and a reportable segment basis in our earnings releases, investor conference calls and filings with the SEC. The non-GAAP financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Also, in the future, we may disclose different non-GAAP financial measures in order to help our investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare our future results of operations with our previously reported results of operations.\nWe view Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP as operating performance measures and, as such, we believe that the U.S. GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to such measures is net loss. In calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP, we exclude from net loss the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the day-to-day operation of our business. We have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of these non-GAAP financial measures as a result of these exclusions. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP are not measurements of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity, as an alternative to net loss, or as an indicator of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDAP as a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measure, including net loss. In addition, we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP to net loss set forth below, in our earnings releases, and in other filings with the SEC and to carefully review the U.S. GAAP financial information included as part of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our Annual Reports on Form 10-K that are filed with the SEC, as well as our quarterly earnings releases, and compare the U.S. GAAP financial information with our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP are used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and by investors as a supplemental financial measure to evaluate the performance of our business that, when viewed with our U.S. GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, we believe provides additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business. We have spent more than 20 years expanding our product and service capabilities, partially through acquisitions of complementary businesses. Due to the expansion of our operations, which included acquisitions, our net loss has included significant charges for depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP exclude these charges and provide meaningful information about the operating performance of our business, apart from charges for depreciation and amortization. We believe the disclosure of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year. We also believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP are measures of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of noncash charges, such as depreciation and amortization, and nonoperating items, such as interest, income taxes, pension and other postretirement benefits, provides additional information about our cost structure and, over time, helps track our operating progress. In addition, investors, securities analysts, and others have regularly relied on Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP to provide financial measures by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry.\nSet forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been excluded from our net income to calculate Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP and the material limitations associated with using these non-GAAP financial measures as compared with net loss from continuing operations:\nTable 37: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Gains or losses from sale of assets and businesses may be useful for investors to consider because they reflect gains or losses from sale of operating units or other assets.

for the above-described limitations of using non-GAAP measures only to supplement our U.S. GAAP results and to provide additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business.\nThe following table shows our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP reconciled to our net loss for the indicated periods (in thousands):\nTable 45: <table> <tr>

fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, from $2.90 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Organic sales adjusted for inter-segment sales decreased $782.3 million, or 29.9%, with additional declines from the Nashville and G650 divestitures of $248.1 million. Organic sales decreased primarily due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including temporarily idle facilities and certain production rate decreases primarily on commercial programs, planned reductions on sunsetting programs (i.e., 747-8, G280, G550), and the transitioned workscope on the E-2 Jet program. These declines were partially offset by increases in military platforms. Net sales for the year ended March 31, 2021, included $43.8 million in total nonrecurring revenues, as compared with $41.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2020.\nCost of Sales and Gross Margin\nCost of sales decreased by $831.1 million, or 36.0%, to $1.48 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, from $2.31 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Organic cost of sales adjusted for inter-segment sales decreased $588.8 million, or 29.0%, with additional declines from the Nashville and G650 divestitures of $242.3 million. Organic cost of sales decreased primarily due to the lower volumes described above within our discussion of net sales and a $10.0 million partial reversal of prior loss reserves. These decreases were partially offset by an approximately $23.7 million impairment loss recognized in cost of sales on certain rotable inventory that primarily arose as a result of customer fleet retirement announcements resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOrganic gross margin for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, was 21.1% compared with 22.1% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. The gross margin for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, decreased primarily as a result of the impairment of rotable asset inventory as cost-reduction actions and certain favorable customer settlements offset absorption related increases. Gross margin for the year ended March 31, 2021, included net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments on long-term contracts of $12.3 million. The favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments to operating income included gross favorable adjustments of $55.2 million and gross unfavorable adjustments of $42.8 million. Gross margins for the year ended March 31, 2020, included net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $22.8 million.\nSegment Operating Income\nSegment operating income decreased by $337.4 million, or 184.2%, to an operating loss of $154.2 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, from segment operating income of $183.2 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Organic segment operating income decreased by $338.9 million, or 187.9%, primarily due to long-lived asset impairment charges of $252.4 million partially offset by the prior year goodwill impairment of $66.1 million, the decreased volumes and impairment of rotable asset inventory discussed above within our discussion of net sales and cost of sales, increased restructuring costs of $20.4 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases in administrative compensation cost of $20.5 million, travel costs of $6.9 million, decreased research and development costs of $4.9 million, the reduction in the forward loss reserve of a commercial widebody program described above within our discussion of cost of sales, and intangible asset amortization expense of $26.7 million, the latter being the result of the reduction in the carrying value of the long-lived assets impaired in the first fiscal quarter impairment as disclosed in Note 2. Additionally, the Nashville and G650 divestitures contributed approximately $4.3 million of operating income in the year ended March 31, 2021, which is consistent with the operating income contributed in the year ended March 31, 2020.\nCorporate Expense\nCorporate operations incurred expenses of $172.0 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, as compared with $125.3 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. The corporate expenses increased because of increased loss on sale of assets and businesses of $37.7 million, increased restructuring costs of $7.5 million, and a $9.3 million gain on legal judgment in the prior fiscal year. These increases were partially offset by decreased subscription costs of $3.3 million and travel costs of $2.6 million.\nInterest Expense and Other\nInterest expense and other increased by $49.3 million, or 40.3%, to $171.4 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, compared with $122.1 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, due to the write-off of approximately $15.6 million of deferred financing fees associated with the extinguishment of our revolving credit facility and partial extinguishment of our 5.25% Senior Notes due June 1, 2022 (the 2022 Notes\u201d), as well as higher interest rates and relative debt levels and a $6.2 million increase from the net unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rate losses.\nNon-service Defined Benefit Income\nNon-service defined benefit income increased by $8.9 million, or 22.0%, to $49.5 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, compared with $40.6 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to prior year expenses from pension settlements, special termination benefits, and curtailment losses of $64.6 million partially offset by a prior year gain from curtailment of other post-employment benefits of $49.5 million, partially offset by changes in actuarial assumptions and experience which reduced income for the year ended March 31, 2021, by $6.3 million.\nIncome Taxes\nThe income tax expense was $2.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, reflecting an effective tax rate of (0.7)%. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, we adjusted the valuation allowance against the consolidated net deferred tax asset by $73.9 million primarily due to an increase in the net operating loss and changes to temporary differences related to interest disallowance, long-lived intangible asset impairment, and pension and other postretirement benefit plans. As of March 31, 2021, management determined that it was necessary to maintain a valuation allowance against principally all of our net deferred tax assets.\nFiscal year ended March 31, 2020, compared with fiscal year ended March 31, 2019\nTable 52: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,900,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,364,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 183,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (125,298\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (323,366\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (274,679\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 122,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 114,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-service defined benefit income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (40,587\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (56,726\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,426\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (29,433\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (327,146\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales\nNet sales decreased by $464.8 million, or 13.8%, to $2.90 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, from $3.36 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Organic sales adjusted for inter-segment sales increased $140.5 million, or 5.2%, offset by declines from the fiscal 2019 divestitures and fiscal 2020 divestitures, including the Global 7500 transition, of $605.3 million. Organic sales increased primarily due to increased volumes across Airbus commercial programs and various military programs, as well as aftermarket demand for military rotorcraft programs in Systems & Support, increased volumes on G550, 767, 787, G280, and M100 programs as well as increased volume and pricing on E-2 Jets sales to ASTK in Aerospace Structures, and increased demand for accessory components. These increases were partially offset in decreased volumes on 737.\nCost of Sales and Gross Margin\nCost of sales decreased by $617.5 million, or 21.1%, to $2.31 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, from $2.92 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Organic cost of sales adjusted for inter-segment sales increased $26.3 million, or 1.2%, offset by declines from the fiscal 2019 divestitures and fiscal 2020 divestitures, including the Global 7500 transition, of $645.6 million. Organic cost of sales increased primarily due to the higher volumes in the above programs partially offset by the prior year forward loss provisions from the adoption of ASU 2017-07 of $87.2 million. Organic gross margin for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, was 20.8% compared with 17.6% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. The gross margin for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, increased compared with the prior year period due to the nonrecurring forward loss provisions from the adoption of ASU 2017-07.\nGross margin included net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments on long-term contracts of $22.8 million. The unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments to operating income included gross favorable adjustments of $43.4 million and gross unfavorable adjustments of $66.2 million. Gross margins for fiscal 2019 included net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $68.7 million.\nSegment Operating Income\nSegment operating income increased by $134.5 million, or 276.3%, to $183.2 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, from $48.7 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Organic segment operating income increased by $45.1 million, or 31.7%,\nprimarily due to the increased margins above as well as decreases in administrative compensation cost of $13.7 million and research and development of $8.5 million, were partially offset by a $66.1 million goodwill impairment charge under Systems & Support. The fiscal 2019 divestitures and fiscal 2020 divestitures contributed $89.4 million in increased operating income in the current year primarily due to incurring operating losses of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.\nCorporate Expense\nCorporate operations incurred expenses of $125.3 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, as compared with $323.4 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. The corporate expenses included decreased loss on sale of assets and businesses of $168.3 million, decreased compensation cost of $12.3 million, with additional benefit from the legal judgment gain of $9.3 million.\nInterest Expense and Other\nInterest expense and other increased by $7.5 million, or 6.6%, to $122.1 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, compared with $114.6 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, due to higher interest rates and relative debt levels.\nNon-service Defined Benefit Income\nNon-service defined benefit income decreased by $16.1 million, or 28.5%, to $40.6 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, compared with $56.7 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to additional expense in the current year from pension settlements, special termination benefits, and curtailment losses of $64.6 million partially offset by a gain from curtailment of other post-employment benefits of $49.5 million, as well as changes in actuarial assumptions and experience which reduced income for fiscal year 2020 by $4.1 million.\nIncome Taxes\nThe income tax expense was $5.8 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, reflecting an effective tax rate of (24.5)%. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, we adjusted the valuation allowance against the consolidated net deferred tax asset by $36.9 million primarily due to an increase in the net operating loss and changes to temporary differences related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans. As of March 31, 2020, management determined that it was necessary to maintain a valuation allowance against principally all of our net deferred tax assets.\nBusiness Segment Performance\nWe report our financial performance based on the following two reportable segments: Systems & Support and Aerospace Structures. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") utilizes Adjusted EBITDAP as a primary measure of profitability to evaluate performance of our segments and allocate resources.\nThe results of operations among our reportable segments vary due to differences in competitors, customers, extent of proprietary deliverables and performance. For example, Systems & Support, which generally includes proprietary products and/or arrangements where we become the primary source or one of a few primary sources to our customers, our unique manufacturing capabilities command a higher margin. Also, OEMs are increasingly focusing on assembly activities while outsourcing more manufacturing and repair to third parties, and as a result, are less of a competitive force than in previous years. This compares to Aerospace Structures, which generally includes long-term sole-source or preferred supplier contracts and the success of these programs provides a strong foundation for our business and positions us well for future growth on new programs and new derivatives.\nRefer to Item 1 for further details regarding the operations and capabilities of each of our reportable segments.\nWe currently generate a majority of our revenue from clients in the commercial aerospace industry, the military, the business jet industry and the regional airline industry. Our growth and financial results are largely dependent on continued demand for our products and services from clients in these industries. If any of these industries experiences a downturn, our clients in these sectors may conduct less business with us. The following table summarizes our net sales by end market by business segment. The loss of one or more of our major customers or an economic downturn in the commercial airline or the military and defense markets could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Systems & Support\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial aerospace\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Military\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Business Jets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Regional\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-aviation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Systems & Support net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Aerospace Structures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial aerospace\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Military\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Business Jets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Regional\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-aviation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Aerospace Structures net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 61.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Consolidated net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting production rate decreases primarily on commercial programs led to a reduction in the proportion of our sales mix arising from the commercial aerospace end market in both of our segments. The current year transfer of the assets and certain liabilities associated with our Gulfstream G650 wing supply chain activities and the fiscal 2020 divestitures led to reductions in our sales mix arising from the business jets end market and also contributed to the reductions in commercial aerospace within Aerospace Structures.

year ended March 31, 2021, from $1.36 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Sales decreased primarily due the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and decreased sales volumes on commercial narrowbody and widebody programs, partially offset by increases in military platforms.\nCost of Sales and Gross Margin\nSystems & Support cost of sales decreased by $178.6 million, or 18.6%, to $781.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, from $960.5 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Gross margin for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, was 26.2% compared with 29.3% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Cost of sales decreased due to the sales decrease noted above as well as sales mix and the results of our restructuring and cost-reduction activities as well as a $10.0 million partial reversal of prior loss reserves. These decreases were partially offset by an approximately $23.7 million impairment loss recognized in cost of sales on certain rotable inventory that primarily arose as a result of customer fleet retirement announcements resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Gross margin decreased primarily as a result of the changes in sales mix and the impairment of rotable inventory, as cost-reduction actions offset absorption related increases.\nOperating Income and Adjusted EBITDAP\nSystems & Support operating income decreased by $27.8 million, or 19.7%, to $113.5 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, from $141.3 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Operating income decreased primarily due to the decreased sales and factors affecting cost of sales noted above, partially offset by reductions in administrative compensation cost of $9.4 million and restructuring costs of $11.8 million as well the goodwill impairment recognized in the year ended March 31, 2020, of $66.1 million. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAP year over year is due to the same factors that decreased operating income, with the exception of the current year rotable inventory asset impairment and the prior year goodwill impairment, which are excluded from Adjusted EBITDAP.\nOperating Margin and Adjusted EBITDAP Margin\nSystems & Support operating income as a percentage of segment sales increased to 10.7% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, as compared with 10.4% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, due to the factors described above. These same factors contributed to the decrease in Adjusted EBITDAP margin to 14.9% from 15.5% year over year, with the exception of the current year rotable inventory asset impairment and the prior year goodwill impairment, which are excluded from Adjusted EBITDAP.\nAerospace Structures:\nNet Sales\nAerospace Structures net sales decreased by $741.5 million, or 47.7%, to $814.4 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, from $1.56 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Organic net sales decreased by $493.5 million, with additional declines from the Nashville and G650 divestitures of $248.1 million. Organic net sales decreased due to the planned reductions on sunsetting programs (i.e., 747-8, G280, G550), the transitioned workscope on the E-2 Jets and G650 programs, as well as the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including temporarily idle facilities and certain production rate decreases primarily on commercial programs. Net sales for the year ended March 31, 2021, included $43.8 million in total nonrecurring revenues, as compared with $36.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2020.\nCost of Sales and Gross Margin\nAerospace Structures cost of sales decreased by $661.2 million, or 48.6%, to $699.0 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, from $1.36 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Organic cost of sales decreased by $418.9 million, with an additional reduction in cost of sales from the Nashville and G650 divestitures of $242.3 million. Organic gross margin for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, was 14.1% compared with 14.5% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. The decrease in organic cost of sales is due to decrease in sales noted above. Organic gross margin decreased primarily as a result of increased product costs due to the lower sales volumes partially offset by the results of our restructuring and cost reduction activities and certain favorable customer settlements. The gross margin included net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $11.5 million. The net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments included gross favorable adjustments of $54.4 million and gross unfavorable adjustments of $42.8 million. The net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, was $22.9 million.\nOperating Income and Adjusted EBITDAP\nAerospace Structures operating income decreased by $309.6 million, or 739.5%, to an operating loss of $267.7 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, from operating income of $41.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Organic operating income decreased by $311.1 million, or 795.9%. The Nashville and G650 divestitures contributed approximately $4.3 million of operating income in the year ended March 31, 2021, which is consistent with the operating income contributed in the year ended March 31, 2020. The decreased organic operating income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, was primarily the result of the decreases noted above as well as the $252.4 million long-lived asset impairment described above and an increase in restructuring costs of $32.2 million partially offset by decreased administrative compensation cost of $11.1 million and intangible asset amortization expense of $26.7 million, the latter being the result of the reduction in the carrying value of the long-lived assets impaired in the first quarter impairment as disclosed in Note 2. The increase in Adjusted EBITDAP year over year is due to the same factors that increased operating income, except for the long-lived asset impairment charges, which are excluded from Adjusted EBITDAP.\nOperating Margin and Adjusted EBITDAP Margin\nAerospace Structures operating loss as a percentage of segment sales decreased to (32.9)% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, as compared with 2.7% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, due to the decrease in operating income as noted above. These same factors as noted above for the Adjusted EBITDAP contributed to the decrease in Adjusted EBITDAP margin to 2.2% from 6.6% year over year.\nBusiness Segment Performance-Fiscal year ended

from $1.33 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Organic sales increased by $63.3 million, or 4.9%, offset by declines of $30.8 million from the fiscal 2019 divestitures within Systems & Support. Organic sales increased due to increased volumes on engine components, Airbus commercial programs, aftermarket demand for military rotorcraft components, and aftermarket spare part sales and accessory component repairs. These increases were partially offset by decreased volumes on 737.\nCost of Sales and Gross Margin\nSystems & Support cost of sales increased by $8.7 million, or 0.9%, to $960.5 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, from $951.8 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Organic cost of sales increased by $33.1 million, or 3.6%, offset by declines of $24.4 million from the fiscal 2019 divestitures within Systems & Support. Organic gross margin for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, was 29.3% compared with 28.3% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Organic cost of sales increased due to the sales increase noted above and sales mix, partially offset by a reduction of cost of sales as a result of a $5.3 million reduction in acquired contract reserves, which also drove the increased gross margin for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020.\nOperating Income and Adjusted EBITDAP\nSystems & Support operating income decreased by $59.8 million, or 29.7%, to $141.3 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, from $201.1 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Organic operating income decreased by $57.2 million, or 28.8% primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of $66.1 million and increased restructuring costs of $8.3 million, partially offset by decreased research and development costs of $5.9 million and the increased gross margin described above. The fiscal 2019 divestitures resulted in $2.6 million in decreased operating income in the current year primarily due to operating income earned in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.\nOperating Margin and Adjusted EBITDAP Margin\nSystems & Support operating income as a percentage of segment sales decreased to 10.4% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, as compared with 15.2% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, due to the factors described above. These same factors contributed to the decrease in Adjusted EBITDAP margin year over year.\nAerospace Structures:\nNet Sales\nAerospace Structures net sales decreased by $506.5 million, or 24.6%, to $1.56 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, from $2.06 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Organic net sales increased by $68.0 million, offset by declines of $574.5 million from the fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 divestitures within Aerospace Structures. Organic net sales increased due to increased volumes for the G280, G550, 767, and M100 programs, as well as increased volumes and pricing related to the E-2 Jets and 787 programs. These increases were partially offset by decreased volumes on 737.\nCost of Sales and Gross Margin\nAerospace Structures cost of sales decreased by $637.2 million, or 31.9%, to $1.36 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, from $2.00 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Organic cost of sales decreased by $16.0 million, with an additional reduction in cost of sales of $621.3 million from the fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 divestitures within Aerospace Structures. Organic gross margin for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, was 13.0% compared with 7.7% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. The decrease in organic cost of sales is due to the nonrecurring forward loss provisions from the adoption of ASU 2017-07 in the year ended March 31, 2019, of $87.2 million and a reduction in unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $45.8 million partially offset by increases related to the increased net sales above. The gross margin included net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $22.9 million due in large part to the estimated effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments included gross favorable adjustments of $43.3 million and gross unfavorable adjustments of $66.2 million. The net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, was $68.7 million.\nOperating Income and Adjusted EBITDAP\nAerospace Structures operating income increased by $194.3 million, or 127.5%, to $41.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, from an operating loss of $152.4 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Organic operating income increased by $102.3 million, or 182.0%, with further increases resulting from the fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 divestitures within Aerospace Structures of $92.0 million. The increased organic operating income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, was primarily due to the increased gross margin discussed above as well as lower administrative compensation due to decreased severance and headcount of approximately $18.8 million and the approximately $10.0 million gain recognized as a result of the transfer of the E-2 Jets program to ASTK. The increase in Adjusted EBITDAP year over year is due to the same factors that increased operating income.\nOperating Margin and Adjusted EBITDAP Margin\nAerospace Structures operating income as a percentage of segment sales increased to 2.7% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, as compared with (7.4)% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, due to the increase in operating income as noted above. These same factors as noted above for the Adjusted EBITDAP contributed to the increased Adjusted EBITDAP margin year over year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur working capital needs are generally funded through our current cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and proceeds from the Securitization Facility. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, we had a net cash outflow of $173.1 million from operating activities, a decrease of $269.8 million, compared with a net cash inflow of $96.7 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Cash flows from operations were unfavorably impacted by increased disbursements to our suppliers relative to the receipts from our customers, as we were unable to reduce volumes of our material purchases at the same rates that our sales declined from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Cash flows included steady inventory levels and significantly lower accounts payable. Additionally, of the approximately $51.0 million in cash proceeds from the transfer of the assets and certain liabilities associated with the G650 wing supply chain activities, approximately $50.0 million of the cash proceeds were allocated to the settlement of existing relationships derived from operations and therefore are classified within operating cash flows. The remaining approximately $1.0 million of the cash proceeds were allocated to the productive assets transferred as part of the transaction and are classified within investing cash flows. Cash flows from operations began to recover in the second half of the fiscal year. Cash flows from operations also included approximately $40.0 million in the liquidation of prior period customer advances against current period deliveries. Interest payments were approximately $116.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2021, as compared with $99.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. The increase in interest payments was the result of higher interest rates and relative debt levels as a result of the financing activities described below.\nIn March 2020, in response to anticipated headwinds resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the aerospace industry, including the impact on global air travel, we implemented certain cost reduction actions to improve our financial health, align capacity with expected demand, and ensure our long-term competitiveness. This included the reduction of overhead and indirect staff and temporary workers and the selective implementation of furloughs across our business to reduce costs while delivering on customer commitments. Through these initiatives, combined with reductions in travel, corporate events, and other expenses, we achieved our cost reduction goals in fiscal year 2021. We also completed certain previously announced\nconsolidation and shutdown initiatives with sunsetting programs within Aerospace Structures that resulted in cash outflows of approximately $20.0 million.\nCash flows provided by investing activities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, decreased $16.7 million from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, to cash used in investing activities of $9.3 million compared with cash provided by investing activities of $7.4 million. Cash flows provided by investing activities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, included cash from the sale of assets and businesses of $15.9 million offset by capital expenditures of $25.2 million. Cash flows used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, included cash from the fiscal 2020 divestitures of $47.2 million offset by capital expenditures of $39.8 million. We currently expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2022 to be in the range of $30.0 million, of which approximately $22.0 million pertains to our core Systems & Support operating segment. The majority of our fiscal 2022 capital expenditures are capital investments designed to improve our manufacturing efficiency and expand our capabilities.\nCash flows provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, were $277.2 million, compared with cash flows provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, of $293.7 million. In March, we drew on our Credit Facility (as defined below), bringing the outstanding balance as of March 31, 2020, to $400.0 million. This was done as part of a comprehensive precautionary approach to increase our cash position and maximize our financial flexibility, in light of the current volatility in the global markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. In the year ended March 31, 2021, the following significant financing cash flow events occurred:\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We issued $700.0 million of 8.875% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2024 (the First Lien Notes\u201d).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Using a portion of the proceeds from issuance of the First Lien Notes, we terminated the Revolving Credit Facility and fully repaid the $400.0 million borrowed thereunder.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We fully repaid the $75.0 million borrowed as of March 31, 2020, under our Receivables Securitization Facility.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We extinguished approximately $63.5 million of the outstanding balance under the 2022 Notes\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We sold 9.2 million shares of common stock for net cash proceeds of approximately $145.4 million\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> As part of these transactions, we paid approximately $20.7 million in deferred financing costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe remainder of financing cash flows pertain primarily to borrowings and payments under finance leases. As of March 31, 2021, we had $589.9 million of cash on hand and $34.2 million was available under our receivable securitization facility (the Securitization Facility\u201d) (subject to any additional constraints arising from the balance of eligible receivables at that time) after giving effect to approximately $27.8 million in outstanding letters of credit.\nWe have taken a number of actions to improve liquidity. In March 2020, we suspended the declaration and/or payment of dividends until further notice. We have furloughed certain employees and announced reductions in force which were largely implemented in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2021. We have reduced discretionary spending as well as reduced or deferred research and development and capital expenditures. We are also working with our customers and supply chain to accelerate receipts and conserve cash. We have also deferred certain employer payroll tax payments pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ( CARES\u201d) Act. In September 2020, we submitted an application to the IRS requesting a change in the plan year for our U.S. pension plan. The change was designed to minimize the funding impact of the temporary market trough caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The IRS approved our application. As a result, our projected required pension contributions for the next three fiscal years were reduced by approximately $50.0 million. In addition, the pension funding relief provisions of the American Rescue Plan Act ( ARPA\u201d) further reduced our projected pension funding requirements by approximately an additional $200.0 million over the next six fiscal years. We expect to take advantage of additional programs if passed by the federal government.\nAs disclosed above, subsequent to March 31, 2021, we completed the sale of our manufacturing operations in Milledgeville, Georgia, Rayong, Thailand, and Red Oak, Texas, receiving net proceeds of approximately $155.0 million. We intend to use approximately $120.0 million of the net proceeds to redeem approximately $113.0 million aggregate principal amount of the First Lien Notes at a redemption price of 106.656%, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The redemption is required by the terms of the First Lien Notes, and following the redemption, approximately $587.0 million aggregate principal amount of First Lien Notes will remain outstanding. The divestiture transactions will significantly reduce our cash receipts from customers as well as our contractual obligations as disclosed below, including reducing the risk of incurring cash flow losses on long-term fixed price contracts. We also expect that in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 we will use available cash to redeem all $236.5 million aggregate principal outstanding amount of our 2022 Notes at a redemption price of 100.000%, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Subsequent to this redemption, we will have no material outstanding indebtedness maturing before 2024.\nWhile we currently expect fiscal 2022 operations to result in net cash outflows due to liquidation of prior customer advances, losses on exit costs on our 747-8 program and customer settlement; we believe, based on an assessment of our current cash as presented on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2021, as well as current market conditions, that cash flows from operations and borrowings under our receivable securitization facility (the Securitization Facility\u201d) will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements for our current operations for at least the next 12 months. We also believe, based on our current cash, our fiscal 2022 operating cash flow expectations, the expected recovery of cash flows from operations subsequent to fiscal 2022, the successful capital market transactions occurring during the year ended March 31, 2021, and the repayment of the 2022 Notes, that we have the ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of cash to meet anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future. We are evaluating additional funding options from the U.S. government via the U.S. Treasury and various Federal Reserve programs. We are also considering various divestiture opportunities that should provide liquidity as well as opportunities to access credit and capital markets. There can be no assurance that such funding sources will be available to us on\nterms favorable to us, if at all. We may also seek transactions to extend the maturity of our indebtedness, reduce leverage, or decrease interest expense. Such transactions could include one or more repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding indebtedness. These transactions could increase our total amount of secured indebtedness or be dilutive to stockholders. There can be no assurances if or when we will consummate any such transactions or the timing thereof.\nOn August 17, 2020, we completed a series of refinancing transactions that are described below:\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We issued $700.0 million principal amount of the First Lien Notes pursuant to an indenture among us, the Guarantor Subsidiaries (as defined below) and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the First Lien Notes Indenture\u201d). The First Lien Notes were sold at 100% of the principal amount and have an effective interest yield of 8.875%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We repaid the loans and other amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d), which was governed by the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of November 19, 2013 (as amended, the Revolving Credit Agreement\u201d) and terminated all commitment thereunder. The payment of $335.2 million was made using a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the First Lien Notes. We initially cash collateralized the letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Agreement but now have the ability to issue letters of credit under the Securitization Facility.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We entered into amendments to the Securitization Facility. The August amendments removed the covenants that required us to maintain certain financial ratios. As of March 31, 2021, the maximum amount available under the Receivables Securitization Facility was $75.0 million, and we have the ability to reduce the facility amount to not less than $50.0 million. The actual amount available under the Securitization Facility at any point in time is dependent upon the balance of eligible accounts receivables as well as the amount of letters of credit outstanding. At March 31, 2021, there was $0.0 million outstanding under our Securitization Facility. Interest rates on the Securitization Facility are based on prevailing market rates for short-term commercial paper, plus a program fee and a commitment fee.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn September 29, 2020, we entered into additional amendments to the Securitization Facility. The September amendments provide us with enhanced liquidity options by establishing a letter of credit facility under the Securitization Facility which effectively replaces a similar limited letter of credit facility under the Revolving Credit Facility. Pursuant to the letter of credit facility, we may request the Securitization Facility's administrator to issue one or more letters of credit that will expire no later than 12 months after the date of issuance, extension or renewal, as applicable.\nThe 2022 Notes and the 7.750% Senior Notes due August 15, 2025 (the 2025 Notes\u201d) (collectively, the \"Senior Notes\") are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future subordinated indebtedness. The Senior Notes are guaranteed on a full, joint and several basis by each of the Guarantor Subsidiaries.\nPursuant to the documentation governing the Senior Notes, we may redeem some or all of our Senior Notes prior to their stated maturities, subject to certain limitations set forth in the indenture governing the applicable Senior Notes and, in certain cases, subject to significant prepayment premiums. We are obligated to offer to repurchase the Senior Notes at specified prices as a result of certain change-of-control events and a sale of all or substantially all of our assets. These restrictions and prohibitions are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions.\nThe indentures governing the Senior Notes, as well as Securitization Facility, contain covenants and restrictions that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of any of the Guarantor Subsidiaries to (i) grant liens on our assets; (ii) make dividend payments, other distributions or other restricted payments; (iii) incur restrictions on the ability of the Guarantor Subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments or investments; (iv) enter into sale and leaseback transactions; (v) merge, consolidate, transfer or dispose of substantially all of their assets; (vi) incur additional indebtedness; (vii) use the proceeds from sales of assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries (in the case of the Senior Notes); and (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates. We are currently in compliance with all covenants under our debt documents and expect to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.\nFor further information on our long-term debt, see Note 10.\nThe 2022 Notes and 2025 Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future subordinated indebtedness. The 2022 Notes and 2025 Notes are guaranteed on a full, joint and several basis by each of our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that is a borrower under any of our credit facilities or that guarantees any of our debt or that of any of our restricted subsidiaries, in each case incurred under any of our credit facilities.\nOur only consolidated subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the First Lien Notes, 2022 Notes, the 2024 Notes and the 2025 Notes (the \"Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries\") are: (i) the receivables securitization special purpose entity, and (ii) the foreign operating subsidiaries.\nThe First Lien Notes, the 6.250% Senior Secured Notes due September 15, 2024 (the 2024 Notes\u201d),and the guarantees are secured, subject to permitted liens, by second-priority liens on all of our assets and our subsidiary guarantors (the Collateral\u201d) that secure all of the indebtedness under certain hedging and cash management obligations. The First Lien Notes and the 2024 Notes and the guarantees are not secured by the assets of Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries. Some of our assets are excluded from the Collateral, including our real property assets.\nThe following tables present summarized financial information of the Company and the Guarantor Subsidiaries on a combined basis. The combined summarized financial information eliminates intercompany balances and transactions among the Company and the Guarantor Subsidiaries and equity in earnings and investments in any Guarantor Subsidiaries or Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries.

We liquidated approximately $89.0 million in prior period customer advances against current period deliveries. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, we invested in inventory to support ramping and existing programs.\nCash flows provided by investing activities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, decreased $193.2 million from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Cash flows provided by investing activities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, included cash from the fiscal 2020 sales of assets and businesses of $47.2 million offset by capital expenditures of $39.8 million.

Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. Below are those policies applied in preparing our consolidated financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. For additional accounting policies, refer to Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition and Contract Balances\nOur accounting policy regarding revenue recognition is disclosed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. As described in Note 2, for certain contracts and performance obligations, we are required to exercise judgment when developing assumptions regarding expected total costs to fulfill performance obligations, variable consideration, and the standalone selling price of a performance obligation. These assumptions are most significant within the Aerospace Structures business segment because the size and long-term nature of our contracts with customers. Specifically, assumptions regarding the total costs require significant judgment with regard to materials, labor, and overhead costs that are affected by our ability to achieve technical requirements and schedule requirements, as well as our estimation of internal and subcontractor performance projections, anticipated volume, asset utilization, labor agreements, and inflation trends. We continually review and update our assumptions based on market trends and program performance. When we satisfy a performance obligation and recognize revenue over time, material changes in assumptions may result in positive or negative cumulative catch-up adjustments related to revenues previously recognized or, in some cases, forward loss contract reserves.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nRefer to Note 2 and Note 7 for details on our goodwill and intangible asset accounting policies. As disclosed in Note 7, as of March 31, 2021, Aerospace Structures had goodwill of $871.4 million which was fully impaired during fiscal year 2018. The goodwill of one of the reporting units within Systems & Support had goodwill of $66.1 million which was fully impaired during fiscal year 2020. No reporting units have goodwill with a material carrying value that is at risk of impairment as of March 31, 2021.\nWe review identified intangible assets with definite lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Determining whether an impairment loss has occurred requires the use of our internal forecast to estimate future cash flows and the useful life over which these cash flows will occur. As disclosed in Note 2, in May 2020, we concluded that the planned divestitures of our composites manufacturing operations located in Milledgeville, Georgia and Rayong, Thailand, represented a significant change in the manner in which the related asset group was expected to be used and that the asset group therefore needed to be tested for recoverability and\nimpairment. We applied a discount rate of 15.0% to the estimated future excess earnings and cash flows of the asset group in order to estimate the fair value of the asset group as of the measurement date and recognized a total noncash impairment charge of $252.4 million, primarily allocated to definite-lived intangible assets.\nPostretirement Plans\nCertain of our current and former employees participate in defined benefit pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans (collectively, referred to as defined benefit plans\u201d) in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, which we sponsor. The determination of projected benefit obligations and the recognition of expenses related to defined benefit pension plans are dependent on various assumptions. The most significant of these assumptions are the discount rates and the long-term expected rates of return on plan assets. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized for each plan to the extent required over the estimated future life expectancy of plan participants.\nSignificant Assumptions\nWe develop assumptions using relevant experience, in conjunction with market-related data for each plan. Assumptions are reviewed annually with third party consultants and adjusted as appropriate. Refer to Note 15 for details regarding the assumptions used to estimate projected benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost as they pertain to our defined benefit pension plans.\nExpected Return on Plan Assets\nWe determine our expected return on plan assets by evaluating both historical returns and estimates of future returns. Specifically, we consider the plan's actual historical annual return on assets and historical broad market returns over long-term time frames based on our strategic allocation, which is detailed in Note 15. Future returns are based on independent estimates of long-term asset class returns. Based on this approach, the weighted average long-term expected annual rate of return on assets was estimated at 7.94% for fiscal years 2021 and 2020.\nDiscount Rate\nThe discount rate is used to calculate the present value of expected future benefit payments at the measurement date. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and generally decreases pension expense. The discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of high-quality fixed income investments during the retirement benefits maturity period. The pension discount rate is determined by considering an interest rate yield curve comprising AAA/AA bonds, with maturities between zero and thirty years, developed by the plan's actuaries. Annual benefit payments are then discounted to present value using this yield curve to develop a single discount rate matching the plan's characteristics. The discount rate assumption will change from measurement date to measurement date as market yields on high quality corporate bonds change.\nSensitivity Analysis\nPension Expense\nA 25 basis point change in each of the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate would have the following effect on the combined U.S. defined benefit pension plans' pension income for the next 12 months:\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)/Increase in Pension Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25 Basis Point Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25 Basis Point Decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4,218\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (586\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProjected Benefit Obligation\nFunded status is derived by subtracting the respective year-end values of the projected benefit obligations ( PBO\u201d) from the fair value of plan assets. The sensitivity of the PBO to changes in the discount rate varies depending on the magnitude and direction of the change in the discount rate. Refer to Note 12 for a quantitative sensitivity analysis for the PBO.\nIncome Tax\nWe follow ASC 740, Income Taxes, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute criteria for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, as well as guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets, liabilities, net operating losses and tax carryforwards. A valuation allowance is required to be recognized to reduce the recorded deferred tax asset to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income by jurisdiction during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible or when carryforwards can be utilized. We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in this assessment. As of March 31, 2021, we have a valuation allowance against substantially all of our net deferred tax assets given the insufficient positive evidence to support the realization of our deferred tax assets. A reduction in the valuation allowance could result in a significant decrease in income tax expense in the period that the reduction is recorded. However, the exact timing and amount of the reduction in our valuation allowance are unknown at this time and will be subject to the earnings level we achieve as well as our projected income in future periods.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2 for disclosure of the effects of recently issued accounting guidance.",

A valuation allowance is required to be recognized to reduce the recorded deferred tax asset to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income by jurisdiction during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible or when carryforwards can be utilized. We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in this assessment. As of March 31, 2021, we have a valuation allowance against substantially all of our net deferred tax assets given the insufficient positive evidence to support the realization of our deferred tax assets. A reduction in the valuation allowance could result in a significant decrease in income tax expense in the period that the reduction is recorded. However, the exact timing and amount of the reduction in our valuation allowance are unknown at this time and will be subject to the earnings level we achieve as well as our projected income in future periods.\n\nTable 55: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Segment Sales\n</td>

For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, we used $173.1 million of cash flows in operating activities, used $9.3 million in investing activities, and received $277.2 million from financing activities. Cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2020 were $96.7 million.\nBoeing has predicted that revenue passenger miles will return to 2019 levels in approximately two to three years. Boeing has planned 737 MAX gradual rate increases to 31 per month in early calendar year 2022 with further gradual increases corresponding with market demand. In January, Boeing stated that it has delivered more than 80 737 MAX airplanes since the FAA granted a return to flight and approximately 320 airplanes remain in inventory. Boeing has stated that the balance of 737 MAX airplanes produced during the grounding and included within inventory will be delivered by the close of calendar year 2022. While we expect to see gradual increases in 737 MAX revenue across both of our reportable segments in fiscal year 2022 based on these assumptions, a resurgence of COVID-19 that results in additional delays or shutdowns could degrade this expectation.\nOn September 29, 2020, we entered into additional amendments to the Securitization Facility. The September amendments provide us with enhanced liquidity options by establishing a letter of credit facility under the Securitization Facility which effectively replaces a similar limited letter of credit facility under the Revolving Credit Facility. Pursuant to the letter of credit facility, we may request the Securitization Facility's administrator to issue one or more letters of credit that will expire no later than 12 months after the date of issuance, extension or renewal, as applicable.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we reached an agreement with Gulfstream to optimize the supply chain on our G650 work scope. The G650 wing box and wing completion work, which had been coproduced across three facilities at both companies, are being consolidated into Gulfstream's facilities in Savannah, Georgia. We completed the manufacturing of our final wing box in July 2019. In August 2020, we completed the transfer of our remaining G650 wing supply chain activity and engineering services to Gulfstream. As a result of the divestiture of our composites manufacturing operations located in Milledgeville, Georgia, in May 2021, we no longer are responsible for the production of G650 wing components. We continue to produce G650 flaps under a separate supply agreement.\nTable 49: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal year ended March 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Systems & Support\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Aerospace\nStructures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Corporate/\nEliminations\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating (loss) income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (274,679\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 201,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (152,407\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (323,366\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on sale of assets and businesses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 235,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 235,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adoption of ASU 2017-07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 87,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 87,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of acquired contract liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (67,314\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (34,121\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (33,193\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 149,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 111,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 130,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 202,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (84,965\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nconsolidation and shutdown initiatives with sunsetting programs within Aerospace Structures that resulted in cash outflows of approximately $20.0 million.\nIncome Tax\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Pension\nBenefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Other\nPostretirement\nBenefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Projected benefit obligation at March 31, 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,230,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Plan assets at March 31, 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,853,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Projected contributions by fiscal year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total 2022 - 2026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 Gains or losses from sale of assets and businesses may be useful for investors to consider because they reflect gains or losses from sale of operating units or other assets.

While these costs were largely mitigated through our cost reduction initiatives during the year ended March 31, 2021, continued or further cost increases may not be mitigated through additional cost reduction initiatives and could negatively impact earnings and cash flows, particularly with respect to our fixed-price contracts.\nTable 58: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Segment Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Systems & Support\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 141,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 201,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (29.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Aerospace Structures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (152,407\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 127.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.4\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (125,298\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (323,366\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 61.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total segment operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 57,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (274,679\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 121.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8.2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSystems & Support operating income decreased by $59.8 million, or 29.7%, to $141.3 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, from $201.1 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.

We do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure. \nWe are unable at this time to reasonably estimate potential future additional financial impacts or a range of loss, if any, due to continued uncertainties related to the impacts of COVID-19 on our operations, supply chain and customers, future changes to OEM production rates, supply chain impacts, and/or the results of negotiations with particular customers. Any such impacts, including any changes in our estimates, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows.\nThe discount rate is used to calculate the present value of expected future benefit payments at the measurement date. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and generally decreases pension expense. The discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of high-quality fixed income investments during the retirement benefits maturity period. The pension discount rate is determined by considering an interest rate yield curve comprising AAA/AA bonds, with maturities between zero and thirty years, developed by the plan's actuaries. Annual benefit payments are then discounted to present value using this yield curve to develop a single discount rate matching the plan's characteristics. The discount rate assumption will change from measurement date to measurement date as market yields on high quality corporate bonds change.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nSystems & Support operating income decreased by $27.8 million, or 19.7%, to $113.5 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, from $141.3 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Operating income decreased primarily due to the decreased sales and factors affecting cost of sales noted above, partially offset by reductions in administrative compensation cost of $9.4 million and restructuring costs of $11.8 million as well the goodwill impairment recognized in the year ended March 31, 2020, of $66.1 million. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAP year over year is due to the same factors that decreased operating income, with the exception of the current year rotable inventory asset impairment and the prior year goodwill impairment, which are excluded from Adjusted EBITDAP.\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, we divested of a number of our assets and operations, including (i) selling all of the shares of Triumph Structures - East Texas, Inc. and all of the shares of Triumph Structures - Los Angeles, Inc. and Triumph Processing, Inc. (collectively, the \"Long & Large\"), (ii) transitioning the responsibility for the Bombardier Global 7500 (\"Global 7500\") wing program manufacturing operations of Aerospace Structures to Bombardier, (iii) selling all of the shares of Triumph Fabrications - San Diego, Inc. and Triumph Fabrications - Ft. Worth, Inc. (together, \"Fabrications\"), (iv) selling all of the shares of Triumph Structures - Kansas City, Inc., Triumph Structures - Wichita, Inc., Triumph Gear Systems - Toronto, ULC and Triumph Northwest (The Triumph Group Operations, Inc.) (together, \"Machining\"), and (v) selling all of the shares of Triumph Aviation Services - NAAS Division, Inc. (\"NAAS\"). Collectively, these transactions are referred to as the \"fiscal 2019 divestitures\". We recognized combined net losses of $235.3 million associated with the fiscal 2019 divestitures, which are presented on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations within loss on divestitures. With the exception of NAAS, the operating results for the fiscal 2019 divestitures are included in Aerospace Structures (\"fiscal 2019 Aerospace Structures Divestitures\") through the respective dates of divestiture. The operating results for NAAS are included in Systems & Support through the date of divestiture.\n \u2022 We sold 9.2 million shares of common stock for net cash proceeds of approximately $145.4 million \nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\n (1) Includes fixed-rate interest only. \nCost of Sales and Gross Margin\nThe indentures governing the Senior Notes, as well as Securitization Facility, contain covenants and restrictions that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of any of the Guarantor Subsidiaries to (i) grant liens on our assets; (ii) make dividend payments, other distributions or other restricted payments; (iii) incur restrictions on the ability of the Guarantor Subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments or investments; (iv) enter into sale and leaseback transactions; (v) merge, consolidate, transfer or dispose of substantially all of their assets; (vi) incur additional indebtedness; (vii) use the proceeds from sales of assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries (in the case of the Senior Notes); and (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates. We are currently in compliance with all covenants under our debt documents and expect to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.\nIn May 2020, we reached agreement to the accelerated transfer of the G280 wing program to IAI and Korean Aerospace Industries. We completed the final wing assembly in July 2020 and have closed our manufacturing operations at the leased Tulsa factory as of the end of October 2020.\nWhile the long-term outlook for the aerospace industry remains positive due the fundamental drivers of air travel demand, current expectations are that it will take 2-3 years for travel to return to calendar 2019 levels and a few years beyond that for the industry to return to long-term trend growth, although there can be no assurance that such period will not be longer. To balance the supply and demand given the COVID-19 shock and to preserve long-term potential and competitiveness, our customers have decided to reduce the production rates of several of their commercial aircraft programs. These rate decisions were based on assessments of the demand environment. There is uncertainty with respect to how commercial air traffic levels will recover, and whether and at what point capacity will return to and/or exceed pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. We continue to work with our customers to closely monitor the key factors that affect backlog and future demand including customers' evolving manufacturing plans, the widebody replacement cycle and the cargo market, but such impact could be material and make it difficult to compare periods.\nManagement compensates for the above-described limitations of using non-GAAP measures only to supplement our U.S. GAAP results and to provide additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business.\n\n * Includes impairment charges related to intangible assets \nCost of Sales and Gross Margin\nSystems & Support cost of sales increased by $8.7 million, or 0.9%, to $960.5 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, from $951.8 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Organic cost of sales increased by $33.1 million, or 3.6%, offset by declines of $24.4 million from the fiscal 2019 divestitures within Systems & Support. Organic gross margin for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, was 29.3% compared with 28.3% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Organic cost of sales increased due to the sales increase noted above and sales mix, partially offset by a reduction of cost of sales as a result of a $5.3 million reduction in acquired contract reserves, which also drove the increased gross margin for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020.\n \u2022 Income tax expense may be useful for investors to consider because it generally represents the taxes that may be payable for the period and the change in deferred income taxes during the period and may reduce the amount of funds otherwise available for use in our business. However, we do not consider the amount of income tax expense to be a representative component of the day-to-day operating performance of our business. \nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere herein.\nOur working capital needs are generally funded through our current cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and proceeds from the Securitization Facility. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, we had a net cash outflow of $173.1 million from operating activities, a decrease of $269.8 million, compared with a net cash inflow of $96.7 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Cash flows from operations were unfavorably impacted by increased disbursements to our suppliers relative to the receipts from our customers, as we were unable to reduce volumes of our material purchases at the same rates that our sales declined from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Cash flows included steady inventory levels and significantly lower accounts payable. Additionally, of the approximately $51.0 million in cash proceeds from the transfer of the assets and certain liabilities associated with the G650 wing supply chain activities, approximately $50.0 million of the cash proceeds were allocated to the settlement of existing relationships derived from operations and therefore are classified within operating cash flows. The remaining approximately $1.0 million of the cash proceeds were allocated to the productive assets transferred as part of the transaction and are classified within investing cash flows. Cash flows from operations began to recover in the second half of the fiscal year. Cash flows from operations also included approximately $40.0 million in the liquidation of prior period customer advances against current period deliveries. Interest payments were approximately $116.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2021, as compared with $99.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. The increase in interest payments was the result of higher interest rates and relative debt levels as a result of the financing activities described below.\nAerospace Structures:\nWhile we currently expect fiscal 2022 operations to result in net cash outflows due to liquidation of prior customer advances, losses on exit costs on our 747-8 program and customer settlement; we believe, based on an assessment of our current cash as presented on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2021, as well as current market conditions, that cash flows from operations and borrowings under our receivable securitization facility (the Securitization Facility\u201d) will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements for our current operations for at least the next 12 months. We also believe, based on our current cash, our fiscal 2022 operating cash flow expectations, the expected recovery of cash flows from operations subsequent to fiscal 2022, the successful capital market transactions occurring during the year ended March 31, 2021, and the repayment of the 2022 Notes, that we have the ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of cash to meet anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future. We are evaluating additional funding options from the U.S. government via the U.S. Treasury and various Federal Reserve programs. We are also considering various divestiture opportunities that should provide liquidity as well as opportunities to access credit and capital markets. There can be no assurance that such funding sources will be available to us on\nThe remainder of financing cash flows pertain primarily to borrowings and payments under finance leases. As of March 31, 2021, we had $589.9 million of cash on hand and $34.2 million was available under our receivable securitization facility (the Securitization Facility\u201d) (subject to any additional constraints arising from the balance of eligible receivables at that time) after giving effect to approximately $27.8 million in outstanding letters of credit.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAerospace Structures operating income increased by $194.3 million, or 127.5%, to $41.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, from an operating loss of $152.4 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Organic operating income increased by $102.3 million, or 182.0%, with further increases resulting from the fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 divestitures within Aerospace Structures of $92.0 million. The increased organic operating income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, was primarily due to the increased gross margin discussed above as well as lower administrative compensation due to decreased severance and headcount of approximately $18.8 million and the approximately $10.0 million gain recognized as a result of the transfer of the E-2 Jets program to ASTK. The increase in Adjusted EBITDAP year over year is due to the same factors that increased operating income.\nFiscal year ended March 31, 2021, compared with fiscal year ended March 31, 2020\n \u2022 Amortization expense and nonrecurring asset impairments (including goodwill, intangible asset impairments, and nonrecurring rotable inventory impairments) may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the estimated attrition of our acquired customer base and the diminishing value of tradenames, product rights, licenses, or, in the case of goodwill, other assets that are not individually identified and separately recognized under U.S. GAAP, or, in the case of nonrecurring asset impairments, the impact of unusual and nonrecurring events affecting the estimated recoverability of existing assets. We do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure. \n\nAs disclosed above, subsequent to March 31, 2021, we completed the sale of our manufacturing operations in Milledgeville, Georgia, Rayong, Thailand, and Red Oak, Texas, receiving net proceeds of approximately $155.0 million. We intend to use approximately $120.0 million of the net proceeds to redeem approximately $113.0 million aggregate principal amount of the First Lien Notes at a redemption price of 106.656%, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The redemption is required by the terms of the First Lien Notes, and following the redemption, approximately $587.0 million aggregate principal amount of First Lien Notes will remain outstanding. The divestiture transactions will significantly reduce our cash receipts from customers as well as our contractual obligations as disclosed below, including reducing the risk of incurring cash flow losses on long-term fixed price contracts. We also expect that in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 we will use available cash to redeem all $236.5 million aggregate principal outstanding amount of our 2022 Notes at a redemption price of 100.000%, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Subsequent to this redemption, we will have no material outstanding indebtedness maturing before 2024.\nNet Sales\nSystems & Support net sales increased by $32.6 million, or 2.5%, to $1.36 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, from $1.33 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Organic sales increased by $63.3 million, or 4.9%, offset by declines of $30.8 million from the fiscal 2019 divestitures within Systems & Support. Organic sales increased due to increased volumes on engine components, Airbus commercial programs, aftermarket demand for military rotorcraft components, and aftermarket spare part sales and accessory component repairs. These increases were partially offset by decreased volumes on 737.\nWe currently generate a majority of our revenue from clients in the commercial aerospace industry, the military, the business jet industry and the regional airline industry. Our growth and financial results are largely dependent on continued demand for our products and services from clients in these industries. If any of these industries experiences a downturn, our clients in these sectors may conduct less business with us. The following table summarizes our net sales by end market by business segment. The loss of one or more of our major customers or an economic downturn in the commercial airline or the military and defense markets could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIncome Taxes\nExpected Return on Plan Assets\nA 25 basis point change in each of the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate would have the following effect on the combined U.S. defined benefit pension plans' pension income for the next 12 months:\nWe prepare and publicly release annual audited and quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") rules, we also disclose and discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our public filings and earning releases. Currently, the non-GAAP financial measures that we disclose are Adjusted EBITDA, which is our net loss before interest, income taxes, amortization of acquired contract liabilities, legal settlements, loss on divestitures, depreciation and amortization; and Adjusted EBITDAP, which is Adjusted EBITDA, before pension expense or benefit, including the effects of curtailments, settlements, and other early retirement incentives. We disclose Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated and Adjusted EBITDAP on a consolidated and a reportable segment basis in our earnings releases, investor conference calls and filings with the SEC. The non-GAAP financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Also, in the future, we may disclose different non-GAAP financial measures in order to help our investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare our future results of operations with our previously reported results of operations.\nSegment operating income decreased by $337.4 million, or 184.2%, to an operating loss of $154.2 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, from segment operating income of $183.2 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Organic segment operating income decreased by $338.9 million, or 187.9%, primarily due to long-lived asset impairment charges of $252.4 million partially offset by the prior year goodwill impairment of $66.1 million, the decreased volumes and impairment of rotable asset inventory discussed above within our discussion of net sales and cost of sales, increased restructuring costs of $20.4 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases in administrative compensation cost of $20.5 million, travel costs of $6.9 million, decreased research and development costs of $4.9 million, the reduction in the forward loss reserve of a commercial widebody program described above within our discussion of cost of sales, and intangible asset amortization expense of $26.7 million, the latter being the result of the reduction in the carrying value of the long-lived assets impaired in the first fiscal quarter impairment as disclosed in Note 2. Additionally, the Nashville and G650 divestitures contributed approximately $4.3 million of operating income in the year ended March 31, 2021, which is consistent with the operating income contributed in the year ended March 31, 2020.\nPostretirement Plans\nThe 2022 Notes and the 7.750% Senior Notes due August 15, 2025 (the 2025 Notes\u201d) (collectively, the \"Senior Notes\") are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future subordinated indebtedness. The Senior Notes are guaranteed on a full, joint and several basis by each of the Guarantor Subsidiaries.\n\n\nThe T-7 Red Hawk wing and horizontal tail manufacturing operations were part of the sale of our Red Oak, Texas manufacturing operations which closed in May 2021. The related manufacturing operations did not have a significant impact on the results of our operations in the year ended March 31, 2021.\nAerospace Structures cost of sales decreased by $637.2 million, or 31.9%, to $1.36 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, from $2.00 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Organic cost of sales decreased by $16.0 million, with an additional reduction in cost of sales of $621.3 million from the fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 divestitures within Aerospace Structures. Organic gross margin for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, was 13.0% compared with 7.7% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. The decrease in organic cost of sales is due to the nonrecurring forward loss provisions from the adoption of ASU 2017-07 in the year ended March 31, 2019, of $87.2 million and a reduction in unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $45.8 million partially offset by increases related to the increased net sales above. The gross margin included net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $22.9 million due in large part to the estimated effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments included gross favorable adjustments of $43.3 million and gross unfavorable adjustments of $66.2 million. The net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, was $68.7 million.\nOVERVIEW\nBusiness Segment Performance\nThe following includes a discussion of our consolidated and business segment results of operations. Our diverse structure and customer base do not provide for precise comparisons of the impact of price and volume changes to our results. However, we have disclosed the significant variances between the respective periods.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nWe have committed to several plans that incorporated the restructuring of certain of our businesses. As of March 31, 2021, with the exception of two pending facility closures to be completed in fiscal 2022 or 2023, we have substantially completed these plans.\nOperating Income and Adjusted EBITDAP\nCorporate Expense\nBoeing 747-8\nSystems & Support:\n \u2022 Included in operating loss for fiscal 2021 was loss on sale of assets and businesses of $104.7 million and restructuring charges of $53.2 million. \nAerospace Structures net sales decreased by $506.5 million, or 24.6%, to $1.56 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, from $2.06 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Organic net sales increased by $68.0 million, offset by declines of $574.5 million from the fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 divestitures within Aerospace Structures. Organic net sales increased due to increased volumes for the G280, G550, 767, and M100 programs, as well as increased volumes and pricing related to the E-2 Jets and 787 programs. These increases were partially offset by decreased volumes on 737.\nFor example, we expect that, in the event that our customers are unable to resume aircraft deliveries consistent with provided assumptions, the continued absence of revenue, earnings, and cash flows associated with those deliveries would continue to have a material impact on our operating results. In the event that future OEM production rate increases occur at a slower rate or take longer than we are currently assuming, we expect that the growth in inventory and other cash flow impacts associated with production would decrease. However, while any prolonged delays in planned OEM production rate increases could mitigate the impact on our liquidity, it could significantly increase the overall expected costs to manufacture our products, which would reduce operating margins and/or increase abnormal production costs in the future. Additionally, the declines in global air travel are expected to result in reduced demand for MRO services and uncertainty exists related to the length of time until air travel returns to historical levels.\nNet Sales\nOperating Income and Adjusted EBITDAP\nT-7 Red Hawk\n\nRefer to Note 2 and Note 7 for details on our goodwill and intangible asset accounting policies. As disclosed in Note 7, as of March 31, 2021, Aerospace Structures had goodwill of $871.4 million which was fully impaired during fiscal year 2018. The goodwill of one of the reporting units within Systems & Support had goodwill of $66.1 million which was fully impaired during fiscal year 2020. No reporting units have goodwill with a material carrying value that is at risk of impairment as of March 31, 2021.\nAlthough none of the development or production programs noted above individually are expected to have a material impact on our net revenues, they do have the potential, either individually or in the aggregate, to materially and negatively impact our consolidated results of operations if future changes in estimates result in the need for a forward loss provision. Absent any such loss provisions, we do not anticipate that any of these programs will significantly dilute our future consolidated margins, although a prolonged impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in changes in expectations.\nThe fluctuations from period to period within the amounts of the components of the reconciliations above are discussed further below within Results of Operations.\nGross margin included net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments on long-term contracts of $22.8 million. The unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments to operating income included gross favorable adjustments of $43.4 million and gross unfavorable adjustments of $66.2 million. Gross margins for fiscal 2019 included net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $68.7 million.\nInterest Expense and Other\nDuring late fiscal 2020, in response to anticipated market headwinds primarily arising from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we committed to new restructuring and cost reduction activities to align capacity with expected demand. These plans and related activities were implemented to generate savings of approximately $120.0 million in fiscal 2021 on a consolidated basis, primarily from headcount and other human resource related cost reductions. We achieved these savings goals for the year ended March 31, 2021.\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, we divested of a number of our assets and operations, including the sale of our manufacturing operations at our Nashville, Tennessee, facility and the assignment of our E-2 Jets contract with Embraer for the manufacture of structural components for their program to AeroSpace Technologies of Korea Inc. (\"ASTK\"). We recognized combined net losses of $56.9 million associated with the fiscal 2020 divestitures, which are presented on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations within loss on sale of assets and businesses, net. The operating results of the Nashville manufacturing operations are included in Aerospace Structures through the date of divestiture or assignment. Collectively, these transactions are referred to as the fiscal 2020 divestitures.\u201d\n \u2022 Backlog decreased 41.6% over the prior year to $1.9 billion primarily due to the divestitures occurring in and subsequent to the year-ended March 31, 2021, which had backlog of approximately $684.3 million as of March 31, 2020. \nSensitivity Analysis\nInterest expense and other increased by $49.3 million, or 40.3%, to $171.4 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, compared with $122.1 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, due to the write-off of approximately $15.6 million of deferred financing fees associated with the extinguishment of our revolving credit facility and partial extinguishment of our 5.25% Senior Notes due June 1, 2022 (the 2022 Notes\u201d), as well as higher interest rates and relative debt levels and a $6.2 million increase from the net unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rate losses.\nSystems & Support net sales decreased by $297.6 million, or 21.9%, to $1.06 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, from $1.36 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Sales decreased primarily due the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and decreased sales volumes on commercial narrowbody and widebody programs, partially offset by increases in military platforms.\n\nAerospace Structures cost of sales decreased by $661.2 million, or 48.6%, to $699.0 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, from $1.36 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Organic cost of sales decreased by $418.9 million, with an additional reduction in cost of sales from the Nashville and G650 divestitures of $242.3 million. Organic gross margin for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, was 14.1% compared with 14.5% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. The decrease in organic cost of sales is due to decrease in sales noted above. Organic gross margin decreased primarily as a result of increased product costs due to the lower sales volumes partially offset by the results of our restructuring and cost reduction activities and certain favorable customer settlements. The gross margin included net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $11.5 million. The net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments included gross favorable adjustments of $54.4 million and gross unfavorable adjustments of $42.8 million. The net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, was $22.9 million.\nWe determine our expected return on plan assets by evaluating both historical returns and estimates of future returns. Specifically, we consider the plan's actual historical annual return on assets and historical broad market returns over long-term time frames based on our strategic allocation, which is detailed in Note 15. Future returns are based on independent estimates of long-term asset class returns. Based on this approach, the weighted average long-term expected annual rate of return on assets was estimated at 7.94% for fiscal years 2021 and 2020.\nAs of March 31, 2020, Triumph's production on this program has completed from its Hawthorne, California, facility, with the remaining production from its Grand Prairie, Texas, facility expected to be completed in early to mid-fiscal 2022. Facility exit plans are underway at both locations and are expected to result in additional cost to exit of approximately $7.5 million through mid-fiscal 2022 and result in projected cash uses.\nOn August 17, 2020, we completed a series of refinancing transactions that are described below:\nThe results of operations among our reportable segments vary due to differences in competitors, customers, extent of proprietary deliverables and performance. For example, Systems & Support, which generally includes proprietary products and/or arrangements where we become the primary source or one of a few primary sources to our customers, our unique manufacturing capabilities command a higher margin. Also, OEMs are increasingly focusing on assembly activities while outsourcing more manufacturing and repair to third parties, and as a result, are less of a competitive force than in previous years. This compares to Aerospace Structures, which generally includes long-term sole-source or preferred supplier contracts and the success of these programs provides a strong foundation for our business and positions us well for future growth on new programs and new derivatives.\nOur only consolidated subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the First Lien Notes, 2022 Notes, the 2024 Notes and the 2025 Notes (the \"Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries\") are: (i) the receivables securitization special purpose entity, and (ii) the foreign operating subsidiaries.\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, we divested of a number of our assets and operations, including the transfer of the assets and certain liabilities associated with our Gulfstream G650 wing supply chain activities. Additionally, subsequent to March 31, 2021, we completed the sale of our composites manufacturing operations located in Milledgeville, Georgia, and Rayong, Thailand, as well as our manufacturing operations located in Red Oak, Texas. We recognized combined net losses of $104.7 million primarily from these transactions. These losses are presented on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations within loss on sale of assets and businesses, net. The operating results associated with the G650 wing supply chain activities and the composites and other manufacturing operations referred to above were included within Aerospace Structures through the date of transfer and through March 31, 2021, respectively. During the year ended March 31, 2021, these transactions represented, in the aggregate, approximately $266.2 million of the $1.87 billion of consolidated net sales (or approximately 14.2% of consolidated net sales).\nPursuant to the documentation governing the Senior Notes, we may redeem some or all of our Senior Notes prior to their stated maturities, subject to certain limitations set forth in the indenture governing the applicable Senior Notes and, in certain cases, subject to significant prepayment premiums. We are obligated to offer to repurchase the Senior Notes at specified prices as a result of certain change-of-control events and a sale of all or substantially all of our assets. These restrictions and prohibitions are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions.\nFiscal year ended March 31, 2020, compared with fiscal year ended March 31, 2019\n \u2022 The amount of interest expense and other we incur may be useful for investors to consider and may result in current cash inflows or outflows. However, we do not consider the amount of interest expense and other to be a representative component of the day-to-day operating performance of our business. \n \u2022 Using a portion of the proceeds from issuance of the First Lien Notes, we terminated the Revolving Credit Facility and fully repaid the $400.0 million borrowed thereunder. \nWe view Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP as operating performance measures and, as such, we believe that the U.S. GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to such measures is net loss. In calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP, we exclude from net loss the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the day-to-day operation of our business. We have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of these non-GAAP financial measures as a result of these exclusions. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP are not measurements of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity, as an alternative to net loss, or as an indicator of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDAP as a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measure, including net loss. In addition, we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP to net loss set forth below, in our earnings releases, and in other filings with the SEC and to carefully review the U.S. GAAP financial information included as part of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our Annual Reports on Form 10-K that are filed with the SEC, as well as our quarterly earnings releases, and compare the U.S. GAAP financial information with our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP.\nThe above table includes approximately $207.7 million of total contractual obligations pertaining to the manufacturing operations located in Milledgeville, Georgia, Rayong, Thailand, and Red Oak, Texas, that, subsequent to the closing of these transactions in May, are no longer contractual obligations of the Company. Of the $207.7 million total contractual obligations, approximately $183.1 million represented purchase obligations, of which approximately 78% were expected to be paid in less than one year. The majority of the remaining $24.6 million contractual obligations associated with these divestitures pertained to operating leases. The above table excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $11.8 million as of March 31, 2021, since we cannot predict with reasonable certainty the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities.\nCurrent plan documents reserve our right to amend or terminate the plans at any time, subject to applicable collective bargaining requirements for represented employees.\n\nNet Sales\nNet sales decreased by $1.03 billion, or 35.5%, to $1.87 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, from $2.90 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Organic sales adjusted for inter-segment sales decreased $782.3 million, or 29.9%, with additional declines from the Nashville and G650 divestitures of $248.1 million. Organic sales decreased primarily due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including temporarily idle facilities and certain production rate decreases primarily on commercial programs, planned reductions on sunsetting programs (i.e., 747-8, G280, G550), and the transitioned workscope on the E-2 Jet program. These declines were partially offset by increases in military platforms. Net sales for the year ended March 31, 2021, included $43.8 million in total nonrecurring revenues, as compared with $41.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2020.\n\nWe have taken a number of actions to improve liquidity. In March 2020, we suspended the declaration and/or payment of dividends until further notice. We have furloughed certain employees and announced reductions in force which were largely implemented in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2021. We have reduced discretionary spending as well as reduced or deferred research and development and capital expenditures. We are also working with our customers and supply chain to accelerate receipts and conserve cash. We have also deferred certain employer payroll tax payments pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ( CARES\u201d) Act. In September 2020, we submitted an application to the IRS requesting a change in the plan year for our U.S. pension plan. The change was designed to minimize the funding impact of the temporary market trough caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The IRS approved our application. As a result, our projected required pension contributions for the next three fiscal years were reduced by approximately $50.0 million. In addition, the pension funding relief provisions of the American Rescue Plan Act ( ARPA\u201d) further reduced our projected pension funding requirements by approximately an additional $200.0 million over the next six fiscal years. We expect to take advantage of additional programs if passed by the federal government.\nIncome Taxes\nCost of sales decreased by $617.5 million, or 21.1%, to $2.31 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, from $2.92 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Organic cost of sales adjusted for inter-segment sales increased $26.3 million, or 1.2%, offset by declines from the fiscal 2019 divestitures and fiscal 2020 divestitures, including the Global 7500 transition, of $645.6 million. Organic cost of sales increased primarily due to the higher volumes in the above programs partially offset by the prior year forward loss provisions from the adoption of ASU 2017-07 of $87.2 million. Organic gross margin for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, was 20.8% compared with 17.6% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. The gross margin for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, increased compared with the prior year period due to the nonrecurring forward loss provisions from the adoption of ASU 2017-07.\nThe income tax expense was $5.8 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, reflecting an effective tax rate of (24.5)%. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, we adjusted the valuation allowance against the consolidated net deferred tax asset by $36.9 million primarily due to an increase in the net operating loss and changes to temporary differences related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans. As of March 31, 2020, management determined that it was necessary to maintain a valuation allowance against principally all of our net deferred tax assets.\n\nOperating Margin and Adjusted EBITDAP Margin\n\nSignificant financial results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, include:\nAerospace Structures operating loss as a percentage of segment sales decreased to (32.9)% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, as compared with 2.7% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, due to the decrease in operating income as noted above. These same factors as noted above for the Adjusted EBITDAP contributed to the decrease in Adjusted EBITDAP margin to 2.2% from 6.6% year over year.\n \u2022 We entered into amendments to the Securitization Facility. The August amendments removed the covenants that required us to maintain certain financial ratios. As of March 31, 2021, the maximum amount available under the Receivables Securitization Facility was $75.0 million, and we have the ability to reduce the facility amount to not less than $50.0 million. The actual amount available under the Securitization Facility at any point in time is dependent upon the balance of eligible accounts receivables as well as the amount of letters of credit outstanding. At March 31, 2021, there was $0.0 million outstanding under our Securitization Facility. Interest rates on the Securitization Facility are based on prevailing market rates for short-term commercial paper, plus a program fee and a commitment fee. \nCost of sales decreased by $831.1 million, or 36.0%, to $1.48 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, from $2.31 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Organic cost of sales adjusted for inter-segment sales decreased $588.8 million, or 29.0%, with additional declines from the Nashville and G650 divestitures of $242.3 million. Organic cost of sales decreased primarily due to the lower volumes described above within our discussion of net sales and a $10.0 million partial reversal of prior loss reserves. These decreases were partially offset by an approximately $23.7 million impairment loss recognized in cost of sales on certain rotable inventory that primarily arose as a result of customer fleet retirement announcements resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCash flows provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, were $277.2 million, compared with cash flows provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, of $293.7 million. In March, we drew on our Credit Facility (as defined below), bringing the outstanding balance as of March 31, 2020, to $400.0 million. This was done as part of a comprehensive precautionary approach to increase our cash position and maximize our financial flexibility, in light of the current volatility in the global markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. In the year ended March 31, 2021, the following significant financing cash flow events occurred:\nThe following tables present summarized financial information of the Company and the Guarantor Subsidiaries on a combined basis. The combined summarized financial information eliminates intercompany balances and transactions among the Company and the Guarantor Subsidiaries and equity in earnings and investments in any Guarantor Subsidiaries or Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries. The summarized financial information is provided in accordance with the reporting requirements of Rule 13-01 under SEC Regulation S-X for the issuer and Guarantor Subsidiaries.\nPension Expense\n \u2022 We repaid the loans and other amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d), which was governed by the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of November 19, 2013 (as amended, the Revolving Credit Agreement\u201d) and terminated all commitment thereunder. The payment of $335.2 million was made using a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the First Lien Notes. We initially cash collateralized the letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Agreement but now have the ability to issue letters of credit under the Securitization Facility. \n\nWe report our financial performance based on the following two reportable segments: Systems & Support and Aerospace Structures. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") utilizes Adjusted EBITDAP as a primary measure of profitability to evaluate performance of our segments and allocate resources.\n \u2022 Amortization of acquired contract liabilities may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the noncash earnings on the fair value of off-market contracts acquired through acquisitions. We do not believe these earnings necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash earnings related to our operations. \n \u2022 We extinguished approximately $63.5 million of the outstanding balance under the 2022 Notes \nWe follow ASC 740, Income Taxes, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute criteria for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, as well as guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.\nAerospace Structures net sales decreased by $741.5 million, or 47.7%, to $814.4 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, from $1.56 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Organic net sales decreased by $493.5 million, with additional declines from the Nashville and G650 divestitures of $248.1 million. Organic net sales decreased due to the planned reductions on sunsetting programs (i.e., 747-8, G280, G550), the transitioned workscope on the E-2 Jets and G650 programs, as well as the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including temporarily idle facilities and certain production rate decreases primarily on commercial programs. Net sales for the year ended March 31, 2021, included $43.8 million in total nonrecurring revenues, as compared with $36.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2020.\nSystems & Support cost of sales decreased by $178.6 million, or 18.6%, to $781.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, from $960.5 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Gross margin for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, was 26.2% compared with 29.3% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Cost of sales decreased due to the sales decrease noted above as well as sales mix and the results of our restructuring and cost-reduction activities as well as a $10.0 million partial reversal of prior loss reserves. These decreases were partially offset by an approximately $23.7 million impairment loss recognized in cost of sales on certain rotable inventory that primarily arose as a result of customer fleet retirement announcements resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Gross margin decreased primarily as a result of the changes in sales mix and the impairment of rotable inventory, as cost-reduction actions offset absorption related increases.\nOperating Income and Adjusted EBITDAP\nThe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting production rate decreases primarily on commercial programs led to a reduction in the proportion of our sales mix arising from the commercial aerospace end market in both of our segments. The current year transfer of the assets and certain liabilities associated with our Gulfstream G650 wing supply chain activities and the fiscal 2020 divestitures led to reductions in our sales mix arising from the business jets end market and also contributed to the reductions in commercial aerospace within Aerospace Structures. Additionally, both Systems & Support and Aerospace Structures experienced increases in military end market sales primarily from volume on military rotorcraft.\nRevenue Recognition and Contract Balances\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP are used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and by investors as a supplemental financial measure to evaluate the performance of our business that, when viewed with our U.S. GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, we believe provides additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business. We have spent more than 20 years expanding our product and service capabilities, partially through acquisitions of complementary businesses. Due to the expansion of our operations, which included acquisitions, our net loss has included significant charges for depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP exclude these charges and provide meaningful information about the operating performance of our business, apart from charges for depreciation and amortization. We believe the disclosure of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year. We also believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP are measures of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of noncash charges, such as depreciation and amortization, and nonoperating items, such as interest, income taxes, pension and other postretirement benefits, provides additional information about our cost structure and, over time, helps track our operating progress. In addition, investors, securities analysts, and others have regularly relied on Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP to provide financial measures by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry.\nSystems & Support operating income as a percentage of segment sales increased to 10.7% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, as compared with 10.4% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, due to the factors described above. These same factors contributed to the decrease in Adjusted EBITDAP margin to 14.9% from 15.5% year over year, with the exception of the current year rotable inventory asset impairment and the prior year goodwill impairment, which are excluded from Adjusted EBITDAP.\nFunded status is derived by subtracting the respective year-end values of the projected benefit obligations ( PBO\u201d) from the fair value of plan assets. The sensitivity of the PBO to changes in the discount rate varies depending on the magnitude and direction of the change in the discount rate. Refer to Note 12 for a quantitative sensitivity analysis for the PBO.\nIn March 2020, in response to anticipated headwinds resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the aerospace industry, including the impact on global air travel, we implemented certain cost reduction actions to improve our financial health, align capacity with expected demand, and ensure our long-term competitiveness. This included the reduction of overhead and indirect staff and temporary workers and the selective implementation of furloughs across our business to reduce costs while delivering on customer commitments. Through these initiatives, combined with reductions in travel, corporate events, and other expenses, we achieved our cost reduction goals in fiscal year 2021. We also completed certain previously announced\nOperating Margin and Adjusted EBITDAP Margin\nCost of Sales and Gross Margin\nFrom fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2019, our Aerospace Structures business unit experienced operating and forward losses on our production of the Boeing 747-8 fuselage for Boeing, Gulfstream G280 wing for Israel Aerospace Industries, Ltd (\"IAI\") and Gulfstream G650 wing for Gulfstream. Further discussion is included below regarding the significant developments of each program as well as other significant programs.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \u2022 Net loss for fiscal 2021 was $450.9 million or $8.55 per diluted common share. \n\nCorporate operations incurred expenses of $172.0 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, as compared with $125.3 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. The corporate expenses increased because of increased loss on sale of assets and businesses of $37.7 million, increased restructuring costs of $7.5 million, and a $9.3 million gain on legal judgment in the prior fiscal year. These increases were partially offset by decreased subscription costs of $3.3 million and travel costs of $2.6 million.\nAerospace Structures:\nWe develop assumptions using relevant experience, in conjunction with market-related data for each plan. Assumptions are reviewed annually with third party consultants and adjusted as appropriate. Refer to Note 15 for details regarding the assumptions used to estimate projected benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost as they pertain to our defined benefit pension plans.\nThe Boeing 737 MAX program represented approximately 3% of revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. During the third fiscal quarter of the year ended March 31, 2021, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Ag\u00eancia Nacional de Avia\u00e7\u00e3o Civil of Brazil approved the 737 MAX return to flight which was quickly followed by Transport Canada and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency in January 2021. Boeing resumed 737 MAX deliveries in our third fiscal quarter of the year ended March 31, 2021, delivering 27 aircraft. Conditions are expected to improve as COVID-19 vaccination distribution accelerates, and Boeing has projected further 737 MAX rate increases in the latter half of calendar year 2021. The International Air Transport Association has predicted a 55% increase in passengers traveling in 2021 to 2.8 billion passengers.\nOperating Margin and Adjusted EBITDAP Margin\n \u2022 Net sales for fiscal 2021 decreased 35.5% to $1.87 billion. \nNon-service defined benefit income decreased by $16.1 million, or 28.5%, to $40.6 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, compared with $56.7 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to additional expense in the current year from pension settlements, special termination benefits, and curtailment losses of $64.6 million partially offset by a gain from curtailment of other post-employment benefits of $49.5 million, as well as changes in actuarial assumptions and experience which reduced income for fiscal year 2020 by $4.1 million.\n \u2022 Legal judgments and settlements, when applicable, may be useful for investors to consider because it reflects gains or losses from disputes with third parties. We do not believe these earnings necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash earnings related to our operations. \n \u2022 We issued $700.0 million principal amount of the First Lien Notes pursuant to an indenture among us, the Guarantor Subsidiaries (as defined below) and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the First Lien Notes Indenture\u201d). The First Lien Notes were sold at 100% of the principal amount and have an effective interest yield of 8.875%. \nCash flows provided by investing activities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, decreased $193.2 million from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Cash flows provided by investing activities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, included cash from the fiscal 2020 sales of assets and businesses of $47.2 million offset by capital expenditures of $39.8 million. Cash flows used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, included cash from the fiscal 2019 divestitures of $247.6 million, offset by capital expenditures of $47.1 million.\nCertain of our current and former employees participate in defined benefit pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans (collectively, referred to as defined benefit plans\u201d) in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, which we sponsor. The determination of projected benefit obligations and the recognition of expenses related to defined benefit pension plans are dependent on various assumptions. The most significant of these assumptions are the discount rates and the long-term expected rates of return on plan assets. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized for each plan to the extent required over the estimated future life expectancy of plan participants.\nSignificant Assumptions\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nNet Sales\nAerospace Structures operating income decreased by $309.6 million, or 739.5%, to an operating loss of $267.7 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, from operating income of $41.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Organic operating income decreased by $311.1 million, or 795.9%. The Nashville and G650 divestitures contributed approximately $4.3 million of operating income in the year ended March 31, 2021, which is consistent with the operating income contributed in the year ended March 31, 2020. The decreased organic operating income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, was primarily the result of the decreases noted above as well as the $252.4 million long-lived asset impairment described above and an increase in restructuring costs of $32.2 million partially offset by decreased administrative compensation cost of $11.1 million and intangible asset amortization expense of $26.7 million, the latter being the result of the reduction in the carrying value of the long-lived assets impaired in the first quarter impairment as disclosed in Note 2. The increase in Adjusted EBITDAP year over year is due to the same factors that increased operating income, except for the long-lived asset impairment charges, which are excluded from Adjusted EBITDAP.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOrganic gross margin for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, was 21.1% compared with 22.1% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. The gross margin for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, decreased primarily as a result of the impairment of rotable asset inventory as cost-reduction actions and certain favorable customer settlements offset absorption related increases. Gross margin for the year ended March 31, 2021, included net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments on long-term contracts of $12.3 million. The favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments to operating income included gross favorable adjustments of $55.2 million and gross unfavorable adjustments of $42.8 million. Gross margins for the year ended March 31, 2020, included net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $22.8 million.\nSegment operating income increased by $134.5 million, or 276.3%, to $183.2 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, from $48.7 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Organic segment operating income increased by $45.1 million, or 31.7%,\nRefer to Note 2 for disclosure of the effects of recently issued accounting guidance.\n\nThe following table shows our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP reconciled to our net loss for the indicated periods (in thousands):\nCash flows provided by investing activities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, decreased $16.7 million from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, to cash used in investing activities of $9.3 million compared with cash provided by investing activities of $7.4 million. Cash flows provided by investing activities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, included cash from the sale of assets and businesses of $15.9 million offset by capital expenditures of $25.2 million. Cash flows used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, included cash from the fiscal 2020 divestitures of $47.2 million offset by capital expenditures of $39.8 million. We currently expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2022 to be in the range of $30.0 million, of which approximately $22.0 million pertains to our core Systems & Support operating segment. The majority of our fiscal 2022 capital expenditures are capital investments designed to improve our manufacturing efficiency and expand our capabilities.\nCorporate operations incurred expenses of $125.3 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, as compared with $323.4 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. The corporate expenses included decreased loss on sale of assets and businesses of $168.3 million, decreased compensation cost of $12.3 million, with additional benefit from the legal judgment gain of $9.3 million.\n\nAerospace Structures operating income as a percentage of segment sales increased to 2.7% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, as compared with (7.4)% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, due to the increase in operating income as noted above. These same factors as noted above for the Adjusted EBITDAP contributed to the increased Adjusted EBITDAP margin year over year.\n \u2022 As part of these transactions, we paid approximately $20.7 million in deferred financing costs. \n\nOur accounting policy regarding revenue recognition is disclosed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. As described in Note 2, for certain contracts and performance obligations, we are required to exercise judgment when developing assumptions regarding expected total costs to fulfill performance obligations, variable consideration, and the standalone selling price of a performance obligation. These assumptions are most significant within the Aerospace Structures business segment because the size and long-term nature of our contracts with customers. Specifically, assumptions regarding the total costs require significant judgment with regard to materials, labor, and overhead costs that are affected by our ability to achieve technical requirements and schedule requirements, as well as our estimation of internal and subcontractor performance projections, anticipated volume, asset utilization, labor agreements, and inflation trends. We continually review and update our assumptions based on market trends and program performance. When we satisfy a performance obligation and recognize revenue over time, material changes in assumptions may result in positive or negative cumulative catch-up adjustments related to revenues previously recognized or, in some cases, forward loss contract reserves.\nNon-service Defined Benefit Income\nNon-service defined benefit income increased by $8.9 million, or 22.0%, to $49.5 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, compared with $40.6 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to prior year expenses from pension settlements, special termination benefits, and curtailment losses of $64.6 million partially offset by a prior year gain from curtailment of other post-employment benefits of $49.5 million, partially offset by changes in actuarial assumptions and experience which reduced income for the year ended March 31, 2021, by $6.3 million.\nSegment Operating Income\nBoeing 737 MAX\nCost of Sales and Gross Margin\nterms favorable to us, if at all. We may also seek transactions to extend the maturity of our indebtedness, reduce leverage, or decrease interest expense. Such transactions could include one or more repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding indebtedness. These transactions could increase our total amount of secured indebtedness or be dilutive to stockholders. There can be no assurances if or when we will consummate any such transactions or the timing thereof.\nNet Sales\nWe are a major supplier to the aerospace industry and have two reportable segments: (i) Systems & Support, whose companies' revenues are derived from integrated solutions, including design, development and support of proprietary components, subsystems and systems, production of complex assemblies using external designs, as well as full life cycle solutions for commercial, regional and military aircraft; and (ii) Aerospace Structures, whose companies supply commercial, business, regional, and military manufacturers with large metallic and composite structures and produce close-tolerance parts primarily to customer designs and model-based definition, including a wide range of aluminum, hard metal and composite structure capabilities.\nCost of Sales and Gross Margin\nThe income tax expense was $2.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, reflecting an effective tax rate of (0.7)%. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, we adjusted the valuation allowance against the consolidated net deferred tax asset by $73.9 million primarily due to an increase in the net operating loss and changes to temporary differences related to interest disallowance, long-lived intangible asset impairment, and pension and other postretirement benefit plans. As of March 31, 2021, management determined that it was necessary to maintain a valuation allowance against principally all of our net deferred tax assets.\n\n \u2022 We fully repaid the $75.0 million borrowed as of March 31, 2020, under our Receivables Securitization Facility. \nInterest expense and other increased by $7.5 million, or 6.6%, to $122.1 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, compared with $114.6 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, due to higher interest rates and relative debt levels.\nIn addition to the financial obligations detailed in the table above, we also had obligations related to our benefit plans at March 31, 2021, as detailed in the following table. Our other postretirement benefits are not required to be funded in advance, so benefit payments are paid as they are incurred. Our expected net contributions and payments are included in the table below:\nOur expected future cash flows for the next five years for long-term debt, leases and other obligations are as follows:\nThe following tables show our Adjusted EBITDAP by reportable segment reconciled to our operating (loss) income for the indicated periods (in thousands):\nInterest Expense and Other\nThe First Lien Notes, the 6.250% Senior Secured Notes due September 15, 2024 (the 2024 Notes\u201d),and the guarantees are secured, subject to permitted liens, by second-priority liens on all of our assets and our subsidiary guarantors (the Collateral\u201d) that secure all of the indebtedness under certain hedging and cash management obligations. The First Lien Notes and the 2024 Notes and the guarantees are not secured by the assets of Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries. Some of our assets are excluded from the Collateral, including our real property assets.\nimpairment. We applied a discount rate of 15.0% to the estimated future excess earnings and cash flows of the asset group in order to estimate the fair value of the asset group as of the measurement date and recognized a total noncash impairment charge of $252.4 million, primarily allocated to definite-lived intangible assets.\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, we had a net cash inflow of $96.7 million from operating activities, an increase of $271.1 million, compared with a net cash outflow of $174.4 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. We liquidated approximately $89.0 million in prior period customer advances against current period deliveries. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, we invested in inventory to support ramping and existing programs.\nNet sales decreased by $464.8 million, or 13.8%, to $2.90 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, from $3.36 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Organic sales adjusted for inter-segment sales increased $140.5 million, or 5.2%, offset by declines from the fiscal 2019 divestitures and fiscal 2020 divestitures, including the Global 7500 transition, of $605.3 million. Organic sales increased primarily due to increased volumes across Airbus commercial programs and various military programs, as well as aftermarket demand for military rotorcraft programs in Systems & Support, increased volumes on G550, 767, 787, G280, and M100 programs as well as increased volume and pricing on E-2 Jets sales to ASTK in Aerospace Structures, and increased demand for accessory components. These increases were partially offset in decreased volumes on 737.\nSegment Operating Income\n \u2022 Non-service defined benefit income or expense from our pension and other postretirement benefit plans (inclusive of the adoption of ASU 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, and certain pension related transactions such as curtailments, settlements, early retirement or other incentives) may be useful for investors to consider because they represent the cost of postretirement benefits to plan participants, net of the assumption of returns on the plan's assets and are not indicative of the cash paid for such benefits. We do not believe these earnings (expenses) necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash earnings related to our operations. \nCost of Sales and Gross Margin",
    "item_7_text": "Operating Income and Adjusted EBITDAP\nCritical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations, and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management's judgment. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. Below are those policies applied in preparing our consolidated financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. For additional accounting policies, refer to Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nBusiness Segment Performance-Fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, compared with fiscal year ended March 31, 2019\nSystems & Support operating income as a percentage of segment sales decreased to 10.4% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, as compared with 15.2% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, due to the factors described above. These same factors contributed to the decrease in Adjusted EBITDAP margin year over year.\n \u2022 We issued $700.0 million of 8.875% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2024 (the First Lien Notes\u201d). \nRefer to Item 1 for further details regarding the operations and capabilities of each of our reportable segments.\nWe review identified intangible assets with definite lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Determining whether an impairment loss has occurred requires the use of our internal forecast to estimate future cash flows and the useful life over which these cash flows will occur. As disclosed in Note 2, in May 2020, we concluded that the planned divestitures of our composites manufacturing operations located in Milledgeville, Georgia and Rayong, Thailand, represented a significant change in the manner in which the related asset group was expected to be used and that the asset group therefore needed to be tested for recoverability and\n \u2022 Operating loss for fiscal 2021 was $326.2 million. \nOperating Margin and Adjusted EBITDAP Margin\n * Includes impairment charges related to intangible assets \nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets, liabilities, net operating losses and tax carryforwards. A valuation allowance is required to be recognized to reduce the recorded deferred tax asset to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income by jurisdiction during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible or when carryforwards can be utilized. We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in this assessment. As of March 31, 2021, we have a valuation allowance against substantially all of our net deferred tax assets given the insufficient positive evidence to support the realization of our deferred tax assets. A reduction in the valuation allowance could result in a significant decrease in income tax expense in the period that the reduction is recorded. However, the exact timing and amount of the reduction in our valuation allowance are unknown at this time and will be subject to the earnings level we achieve as well as our projected income in future periods.\n\nBusiness Segment Performance-Fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, compared with fiscal year ended March 31, 2020\nG280\nG650\nProjected Benefit Obligation\nOur working capital needs are generally funded through cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit arrangements. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, we used $173.1 million of cash flows in operating activities, used $9.3 million in investing activities, and received $277.2 million from financing activities. Cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2020 were $96.7 million.\nBoeing has predicted that revenue passenger miles will return to 2019 levels in approximately two to three years. Boeing has planned 737 MAX gradual rate increases to 31 per month in early calendar year 2022 with further gradual increases corresponding with market demand. In January, Boeing stated that it has delivered more than 80 737 MAX airplanes since the FAA granted a return to flight and approximately 320 airplanes remain in inventory. Boeing has stated that the balance of 737 MAX airplanes produced during the grounding and included within inventory will be delivered by the close of calendar year 2022. While we expect to see gradual increases in 737 MAX revenue across both of our reportable segments in fiscal year 2022 based on these assumptions, a resurgence of COVID-19 that results in additional delays or shutdowns could degrade this expectation.\nOn September 29, 2020, we entered into additional amendments to the Securitization Facility. The September amendments provide us with enhanced liquidity options by establishing a letter of credit facility under the Securitization Facility which effectively replaces a similar limited letter of credit facility under the Revolving Credit Facility. Pursuant to the letter of credit facility, we may request the Securitization Facility's administrator to issue one or more letters of credit that will expire no later than 12 months after the date of issuance, extension or renewal, as applicable.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we reached an agreement with Gulfstream to optimize the supply chain on our G650 work scope. The G650 wing box and wing completion work, which had been coproduced across three facilities at both companies, are being consolidated into Gulfstream's facilities in Savannah, Georgia. We completed the manufacturing of our final wing box in July 2019. In August 2020, we completed the transfer of our remaining G650 wing supply chain activity and engineering services to Gulfstream. As a result of the divestiture of our composites manufacturing operations located in Milledgeville, Georgia, in May 2021, we no longer are responsible for the production of G650 wing components. We continue to produce G650 flaps under a separate supply agreement.\nconsolidation and shutdown initiatives with sunsetting programs within Aerospace Structures that resulted in cash outflows of approximately $20.0 million.\nIncome Tax\n \u2022 Gains or losses from sale of assets and businesses may be useful for investors to consider because they reflect gains or losses from sale of operating units or other assets. We do not believe these earnings necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash earnings related to our operations. \nCorporate Expense\nDiscount Rate\nFor further information on our long-term debt, see Note 10.\nWe continue to expect the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce demand for commercial aviation aftermarket due to the recent sharp decreases in flights; as well as reduce demand for commercial aviation production as OEMs have lowered their related delivery rate assumptions. The COVID-19 pandemic related reduction in OEM production rates has resulted in additional costs to produce and deliver our products. While these costs were largely mitigated through our cost reduction initiatives during the year ended March 31, 2021, continued or further cost increases may not be mitigated through additional cost reduction initiatives and could negatively impact earnings and cash flows, particularly with respect to our fixed-price contracts.\nSystems & Support operating income decreased by $59.8 million, or 29.7%, to $141.3 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, from $201.1 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Organic operating income decreased by $57.2 million, or 28.8% primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of $66.1 million and increased restructuring costs of $8.3 million, partially offset by decreased research and development costs of $5.9 million and the increased gross margin described above. The fiscal 2019 divestitures resulted in $2.6 million in decreased operating income in the current year primarily due to operating income earned in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.\nSystems & Support:\nThe 2022 Notes and 2025 Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future subordinated indebtedness. The 2022 Notes and 2025 Notes are guaranteed on a full, joint and several basis by each of our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that is a borrower under any of our credit facilities or that guarantees any of our debt or that of any of our restricted subsidiaries, in each case incurred under any of our credit facilities.\nprimarily due to the increased margins above as well as decreases in administrative compensation cost of $13.7 million and research and development of $8.5 million, were partially offset by a $66.1 million goodwill impairment charge under Systems & Support. The fiscal 2019 divestitures and fiscal 2020 divestitures contributed $89.4 million in increased operating income in the current year primarily due to incurring operating losses of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.\nNon-service Defined Benefit Income\nNet Sales\nSet forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been excluded from our net income to calculate Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP and the material limitations associated with using these non-GAAP financial measures as compared with net loss from continuing operations:\n \u2022 Depreciation may be useful for investors to consider because it generally represents the wear and tear on our property and equipment used in our operations. We do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure. \nWe are unable at this time to reasonably estimate potential future additional financial impacts or a range of loss, if any, due to continued uncertainties related to the impacts of COVID-19 on our operations, supply chain and customers, future changes to OEM production rates, supply chain impacts, and/or the results of negotiations with particular customers. Any such impacts, including any changes in our estimates, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows.\nThe discount rate is used to calculate the present value of expected future benefit payments at the measurement date. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and generally decreases pension expense. The discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of high-quality fixed income investments during the retirement benefits maturity period. The pension discount rate is determined by considering an interest rate yield curve comprising AAA/AA bonds, with maturities between zero and thirty years, developed by the plan's actuaries. Annual benefit payments are then discounted to present value using this yield curve to develop a single discount rate matching the plan's characteristics. The discount rate assumption will change from measurement date to measurement date as market yields on high quality corporate bonds change.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nSystems & Support operating income decreased by $27.8 million, or 19.7%, to $113.5 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, from $141.3 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Operating income decreased primarily due to the decreased sales and factors affecting cost of sales noted above, partially offset by reductions in administrative compensation cost of $9.4 million and restructuring costs of $11.8 million as well the goodwill impairment recognized in the year ended March 31, 2020, of $66.1 million. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAP year over year is due to the same factors that decreased operating income, with the exception of the current year rotable inventory asset impairment and the prior year goodwill impairment, which are excluded from Adjusted EBITDAP.\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, we divested of a number of our assets and operations, including (i) selling all of the shares of Triumph Structures - East Texas, Inc. and all of the shares of Triumph Structures - Los Angeles, Inc. and Triumph Processing, Inc. (collectively, the \"Long & Large\"), (ii) transitioning the responsibility for the Bombardier Global 7500 (\"Global 7500\") wing program manufacturing operations of Aerospace Structures to Bombardier, (iii) selling all of the shares of Triumph Fabrications - San Diego, Inc. and Triumph Fabrications - Ft. Worth, Inc. (together, \"Fabrications\"), (iv) selling all of the shares of Triumph Structures - Kansas City, Inc., Triumph Structures - Wichita, Inc., Triumph Gear Systems - Toronto, ULC and Triumph Northwest (The Triumph Group Operations, Inc.) (together, \"Machining\"), and (v) selling all of the shares of Triumph Aviation Services - NAAS Division, Inc. (\"NAAS\"). Collectively, these transactions are referred to as the \"fiscal 2019 divestitures\". We recognized combined net losses of $235.3 million associated with the fiscal 2019 divestitures, which are presented on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations within loss on divestitures. With the exception of NAAS, the operating results for the fiscal 2019 divestitures are included in Aerospace Structures (\"fiscal 2019 Aerospace Structures Divestitures\") through the respective dates of divestiture. The operating results for NAAS are included in Systems & Support through the date of divestiture.\n \u2022 We sold 9.2 million shares of common stock for net cash proceeds of approximately $145.4 million \nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\n (1) Includes fixed-rate interest only. \nCost of Sales and Gross Margin\nThe indentures governing the Senior Notes, as well as Securitization Facility, contain covenants and restrictions that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of any of the Guarantor Subsidiaries to (i) grant liens on our assets; (ii) make dividend payments, other distributions or other restricted payments; (iii) incur restrictions on the ability of the Guarantor Subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments or investments; (iv) enter into sale and leaseback transactions; (v) merge, consolidate, transfer or dispose of substantially all of their assets; (vi) incur additional indebtedness; (vii) use the proceeds from sales of assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries (in the case of the Senior Notes); and (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates. We are currently in compliance with all covenants under our debt documents and expect to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.\nIn May 2020, we reached agreement to the accelerated transfer of the G280 wing program to IAI and Korean Aerospace Industries. We completed the final wing assembly in July 2020 and have closed our manufacturing operations at the leased Tulsa factory as of the end of October 2020.\nWhile the long-term outlook for the aerospace industry remains positive due the fundamental drivers of air travel demand, current expectations are that it will take 2-3 years for travel to return to calendar 2019 levels and a few years beyond that for the industry to return to long-term trend growth, although there can be no assurance that such period will not be longer. To balance the supply and demand given the COVID-19 shock and to preserve long-term potential and competitiveness, our customers have decided to reduce the production rates of several of their commercial aircraft programs. These rate decisions were based on assessments of the demand environment. There is uncertainty with respect to how commercial air traffic levels will recover, and whether and at what point capacity will return to and/or exceed pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. We continue to work with our customers to closely monitor the key factors that affect backlog and future demand including customers' evolving manufacturing plans, the widebody replacement cycle and the cargo market, but such impact could be material and make it difficult to compare periods.\nManagement compensates for the above-described limitations of using non-GAAP measures only to supplement our U.S. GAAP results and to provide additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business.\n\n * Includes impairment charges related to intangible assets \nCost of Sales and Gross Margin\nSystems & Support cost of sales increased by $8.7 million, or 0.9%, to $960.5 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, from $951.8 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Organic cost of sales increased by $33.1 million, or 3.6%, offset by declines of $24.4 million from the fiscal 2019 divestitures within Systems & Support. Organic gross margin for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, was 29.3% compared with 28.3% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Organic cost of sales increased due to the sales increase noted above and sales mix, partially offset by a reduction of cost of sales as a result of a $5.3 million reduction in acquired contract reserves, which also drove the increased gross margin for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020.\n \u2022 Income tax expense may be useful for investors to consider because it generally represents the taxes that may be payable for the period and the change in deferred income taxes during the period and may reduce the amount of funds otherwise available for use in our business. However, we do not consider the amount of income tax expense to be a representative component of the day-to-day operating performance of our business. \nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere herein.\nOur working capital needs are generally funded through our current cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and proceeds from the Securitization Facility. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, we had a net cash outflow of $173.1 million from operating activities, a decrease of $269.8 million, compared with a net cash inflow of $96.7 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Cash flows from operations were unfavorably impacted by increased disbursements to our suppliers relative to the receipts from our customers, as we were unable to reduce volumes of our material purchases at the same rates that our sales declined from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Cash flows included steady inventory levels and significantly lower accounts payable. Additionally, of the approximately $51.0 million in cash proceeds from the transfer of the assets and certain liabilities associated with the G650 wing supply chain activities, approximately $50.0 million of the cash proceeds were allocated to the settlement of existing relationships derived from operations and therefore are classified within operating cash flows. The remaining approximately $1.0 million of the cash proceeds were allocated to the productive assets transferred as part of the transaction and are classified within investing cash flows. Cash flows from operations began to recover in the second half of the fiscal year. Cash flows from operations also included approximately $40.0 million in the liquidation of prior period customer advances against current period deliveries. Interest payments were approximately $116.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2021, as compared with $99.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. The increase in interest payments was the result of higher interest rates and relative debt levels as a result of the financing activities described below.\nAerospace Structures:\nWhile we currently expect fiscal 2022 operations to result in net cash outflows due to liquidation of prior customer advances, losses on exit costs on our 747-8 program and customer settlement; we believe, based on an assessment of our current cash as presented on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2021, as well as current market conditions, that cash flows from operations and borrowings under our receivable securitization facility (the Securitization Facility\u201d) will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements for our current operations for at least the next 12 months. We also believe, based on our current cash, our fiscal 2022 operating cash flow expectations, the expected recovery of cash flows from operations subsequent to fiscal 2022, the successful capital market transactions occurring during the year ended March 31, 2021, and the repayment of the 2022 Notes, that we have the ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of cash to meet anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future. We are evaluating additional funding options from the U.S. government via the U.S. Treasury and various Federal Reserve programs. We are also considering various divestiture opportunities that should provide liquidity as well as opportunities to access credit and capital markets. There can be no assurance that such funding sources will be available to us on\nThe remainder of financing cash flows pertain primarily to borrowings and payments under finance leases. As of March 31, 2021, we had $589.9 million of cash on hand and $34.2 million was available under our receivable securitization facility (the Securitization Facility\u201d) (subject to any additional constraints arising from the balance of eligible receivables at that time) after giving effect to approximately $27.8 million in outstanding letters of credit.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAerospace Structures operating income increased by $194.3 million, or 127.5%, to $41.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, from an operating loss of $152.4 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Organic operating income increased by $102.3 million, or 182.0%, with further increases resulting from the fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 divestitures within Aerospace Structures of $92.0 million. The increased organic operating income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, was primarily due to the increased gross margin discussed above as well as lower administrative compensation due to decreased severance and headcount of approximately $18.8 million and the approximately $10.0 million gain recognized as a result of the transfer of the E-2 Jets program to ASTK. The increase in Adjusted EBITDAP year over year is due to the same factors that increased operating income.\nFiscal year ended March 31, 2021, compared with fiscal year ended March 31, 2020\n \u2022 Amortization expense and nonrecurring asset impairments (including goodwill, intangible asset impairments, and nonrecurring rotable inventory impairments) may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the estimated attrition of our acquired customer base and the diminishing value of tradenames, product rights, licenses, or, in the case of goodwill, other assets that are not individually identified and separately recognized under U.S. GAAP, or, in the case of nonrecurring asset impairments, the impact of unusual and nonrecurring events affecting the estimated recoverability of existing assets. We do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure. \n\nAs disclosed above, subsequent to March 31, 2021, we completed the sale of our manufacturing operations in Milledgeville, Georgia, Rayong, Thailand, and Red Oak, Texas, receiving net proceeds of approximately $155.0 million. We intend to use approximately $120.0 million of the net proceeds to redeem approximately $113.0 million aggregate principal amount of the First Lien Notes at a redemption price of 106.656%, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The redemption is required by the terms of the First Lien Notes, and following the redemption, approximately $587.0 million aggregate principal amount of First Lien Notes will remain outstanding. The divestiture transactions will significantly reduce our cash receipts from customers as well as our contractual obligations as disclosed below, including reducing the risk of incurring cash flow losses on long-term fixed price contracts. We also expect that in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 we will use available cash to redeem all $236.5 million aggregate principal outstanding amount of our 2022 Notes at a redemption price of 100.000%, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Subsequent to this redemption, we will have no material outstanding indebtedness maturing before 2024.\nNet Sales\nSystems & Support net sales increased by $32.6 million, or 2.5%, to $1.36 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, from $1.33 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Organic sales increased by $63.3 million, or 4.9%, offset by declines of $30.8 million from the fiscal 2019 divestitures within Systems & Support. Organic sales increased due to increased volumes on engine components, Airbus commercial programs, aftermarket demand for military rotorcraft components, and aftermarket spare part sales and accessory component repairs. These increases were partially offset by decreased volumes on 737.\nWe currently generate a majority of our revenue from clients in the commercial aerospace industry, the military, the business jet industry and the regional airline industry. Our growth and financial results are largely dependent on continued demand for our products and services from clients in these industries. If any of these industries experiences a downturn, our clients in these sectors may conduct less business with us. The following table summarizes our net sales by end market by business segment. The loss of one or more of our major customers or an economic downturn in the commercial airline or the military and defense markets could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIncome Taxes\nExpected Return on Plan Assets\nA 25 basis point change in each of the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate would have the following effect on the combined U.S. defined benefit pension plans' pension income for the next 12 months:\nWe prepare and publicly release annual audited and quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") rules, we also disclose and discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our public filings and earning releases. Currently, the non-GAAP financial measures that we disclose are Adjusted EBITDA, which is our net loss before interest, income taxes, amortization of acquired contract liabilities, legal settlements, loss on divestitures, depreciation and amortization; and Adjusted EBITDAP, which is Adjusted EBITDA, before pension expense or benefit, including the effects of curtailments, settlements, and other early retirement incentives. We disclose Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated and Adjusted EBITDAP on a consolidated and a reportable segment basis in our earnings releases, investor conference calls and filings with the SEC. The non-GAAP financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Also, in the future, we may disclose different non-GAAP financial measures in order to help our investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare our future results of operations with our previously reported results of operations.\nSegment operating income decreased by $337.4 million, or 184.2%, to an operating loss of $154.2 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, from segment operating income of $183.2 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Organic segment operating income decreased by $338.9 million, or 187.9%, primarily due to long-lived asset impairment charges of $252.4 million partially offset by the prior year goodwill impairment of $66.1 million, the decreased volumes and impairment of rotable asset inventory discussed above within our discussion of net sales and cost of sales, increased restructuring costs of $20.4 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases in administrative compensation cost of $20.5 million, travel costs of $6.9 million, decreased research and development costs of $4.9 million, the reduction in the forward loss reserve of a commercial widebody program described above within our discussion of cost of sales, and intangible asset amortization expense of $26.7 million, the latter being the result of the reduction in the carrying value of the long-lived assets impaired in the first fiscal quarter impairment as disclosed in Note 2. Additionally, the Nashville and G650 divestitures contributed approximately $4.3 million of operating income in the year ended March 31, 2021, which is consistent with the operating income contributed in the year ended March 31, 2020.\nPostretirement Plans\nThe 2022 Notes and the 7.750% Senior Notes due August 15, 2025 (the 2025 Notes\u201d) (collectively, the \"Senior Notes\") are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future subordinated indebtedness. The Senior Notes are guaranteed on a full, joint and several basis by each of the Guarantor Subsidiaries.\n\n\nThe T-7 Red Hawk wing and horizontal tail manufacturing operations were part of the sale of our Red Oak, Texas manufacturing operations which closed in May 2021. The related manufacturing operations did not have a significant impact on the results of our operations in the year ended March 31, 2021.\nAerospace Structures cost of sales decreased by $637.2 million, or 31.9%, to $1.36 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, from $2.00 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Organic cost of sales decreased by $16.0 million, with an additional reduction in cost of sales of $621.3 million from the fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 divestitures within Aerospace Structures. Organic gross margin for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, was 13.0% compared with 7.7% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. The decrease in organic cost of sales is due to the nonrecurring forward loss provisions from the adoption of ASU 2017-07 in the year ended March 31, 2019, of $87.2 million and a reduction in unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $45.8 million partially offset by increases related to the increased net sales above. The gross margin included net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $22.9 million due in large part to the estimated effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments included gross favorable adjustments of $43.3 million and gross unfavorable adjustments of $66.2 million. The net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, was $68.7 million.\nOVERVIEW\nBusiness Segment Performance\nThe following includes a discussion of our consolidated and business segment results of operations. Our diverse structure and customer base do not provide for precise comparisons of the impact of price and volume changes to our results. However, we have disclosed the significant variances between the respective periods.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nWe have committed to several plans that incorporated the restructuring of certain of our businesses. As of March 31, 2021, with the exception of two pending facility closures to be completed in fiscal 2022 or 2023, we have substantially completed these plans.\nOperating Income and Adjusted EBITDAP\nCorporate Expense\nBoeing 747-8\nSystems & Support:\n \u2022 Included in operating loss for fiscal 2021 was loss on sale of assets and businesses of $104.7 million and restructuring charges of $53.2 million. \nAerospace Structures net sales decreased by $506.5 million, or 24.6%, to $1.56 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, from $2.06 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Organic net sales increased by $68.0 million, offset by declines of $574.5 million from the fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 divestitures within Aerospace Structures. Organic net sales increased due to increased volumes for the G280, G550, 767, and M100 programs, as well as increased volumes and pricing related to the E-2 Jets and 787 programs. These increases were partially offset by decreased volumes on 737.\nFor example, we expect that, in the event that our customers are unable to resume aircraft deliveries consistent with provided assumptions, the continued absence of revenue, earnings, and cash flows associated with those deliveries would continue to have a material impact on our operating results. In the event that future OEM production rate increases occur at a slower rate or take longer than we are currently assuming, we expect that the growth in inventory and other cash flow impacts associated with production would decrease. However, while any prolonged delays in planned OEM production rate increases could mitigate the impact on our liquidity, it could significantly increase the overall expected costs to manufacture our products, which would reduce operating margins and/or increase abnormal production costs in the future. Additionally, the declines in global air travel are expected to result in reduced demand for MRO services and uncertainty exists related to the length of time until air travel returns to historical levels.\nNet Sales\nOperating Income and Adjusted EBITDAP\nT-7 Red Hawk\n\nRefer to Note 2 and Note 7 for details on our goodwill and intangible asset accounting policies. As disclosed in Note 7, as of March 31, 2021, Aerospace Structures had goodwill of $871.4 million which was fully impaired during fiscal year 2018. The goodwill of one of the reporting units within Systems & Support had goodwill of $66.1 million which was fully impaired during fiscal year 2020. No reporting units have goodwill with a material carrying value that is at risk of impairment as of March 31, 2021.\nAlthough none of the development or production programs noted above individually are expected to have a material impact on our net revenues, they do have the potential, either individually or in the aggregate, to materially and negatively impact our consolidated results of operations if future changes in estimates result in the need for a forward loss provision. Absent any such loss provisions, we do not anticipate that any of these programs will significantly dilute our future consolidated margins, although a prolonged impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in changes in expectations.\nThe fluctuations from period to period within the amounts of the components of the reconciliations above are discussed further below within Results of Operations.\nGross margin included net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments on long-term contracts of $22.8 million. The unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments to operating income included gross favorable adjustments of $43.4 million and gross unfavorable adjustments of $66.2 million. Gross margins for fiscal 2019 included net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $68.7 million.\nInterest Expense and Other\nDuring late fiscal 2020, in response to anticipated market headwinds primarily arising from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we committed to new restructuring and cost reduction activities to align capacity with expected demand. These plans and related activities were implemented to generate savings of approximately $120.0 million in fiscal 2021 on a consolidated basis, primarily from headcount and other human resource related cost reductions. We achieved these savings goals for the year ended March 31, 2021.\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, we divested of a number of our assets and operations, including the sale of our manufacturing operations at our Nashville, Tennessee, facility and the assignment of our E-2 Jets contract with Embraer for the manufacture of structural components for their program to AeroSpace Technologies of Korea Inc. (\"ASTK\"). We recognized combined net losses of $56.9 million associated with the fiscal 2020 divestitures, which are presented on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations within loss on sale of assets and businesses, net. The operating results of the Nashville manufacturing operations are included in Aerospace Structures through the date of divestiture or assignment. Collectively, these transactions are referred to as the fiscal 2020 divestitures.\u201d\n \u2022 Backlog decreased 41.6% over the prior year to $1.9 billion primarily due to the divestitures occurring in and subsequent to the year-ended March 31, 2021, which had backlog of approximately $684.3 million as of March 31, 2020. \nSensitivity Analysis\nInterest expense and other increased by $49.3 million, or 40.3%, to $171.4 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, compared with $122.1 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, due to the write-off of approximately $15.6 million of deferred financing fees associated with the extinguishment of our revolving credit facility and partial extinguishment of our 5.25% Senior Notes due June 1, 2022 (the 2022 Notes\u201d), as well as higher interest rates and relative debt levels and a $6.2 million increase from the net unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rate losses.\nSystems & Support net sales decreased by $297.6 million, or 21.9%, to $1.06 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, from $1.36 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Sales decreased primarily due the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and decreased sales volumes on commercial narrowbody and widebody programs, partially offset by increases in military platforms.\n\nAerospace Structures cost of sales decreased by $661.2 million, or 48.6%, to $699.0 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, from $1.36 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Organic cost of sales decreased by $418.9 million, with an additional reduction in cost of sales from the Nashville and G650 divestitures of $242.3 million. Organic gross margin for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, was 14.1% compared with 14.5% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. The decrease in organic cost of sales is due to decrease in sales noted above. Organic gross margin decreased primarily as a result of increased product costs due to the lower sales volumes partially offset by the results of our restructuring and cost reduction activities and certain favorable customer settlements. The gross margin included net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $11.5 million. The net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments included gross favorable adjustments of $54.4 million and gross unfavorable adjustments of $42.8 million. The net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, was $22.9 million.\nWe determine our expected return on plan assets by evaluating both historical returns and estimates of future returns. Specifically, we consider the plan's actual historical annual return on assets and historical broad market returns over long-term time frames based on our strategic allocation, which is detailed in Note 15. Future returns are based on independent estimates of long-term asset class returns. Based on this approach, the weighted average long-term expected annual rate of return on assets was estimated at 7.94% for fiscal years 2021 and 2020.\nAs of March 31, 2020, Triumph's production on this program has completed from its Hawthorne, California, facility, with the remaining production from its Grand Prairie, Texas, facility expected to be completed in early to mid-fiscal 2022. Facility exit plans are underway at both locations and are expected to result in additional cost to exit of approximately $7.5 million through mid-fiscal 2022 and result in projected cash uses.\nOn August 17, 2020, we completed a series of refinancing transactions that are described below:\nThe results of operations among our reportable segments vary due to differences in competitors, customers, extent of proprietary deliverables and performance. For example, Systems & Support, which generally includes proprietary products and/or arrangements where we become the primary source or one of a few primary sources to our customers, our unique manufacturing capabilities command a higher margin. Also, OEMs are increasingly focusing on assembly activities while outsourcing more manufacturing and repair to third parties, and as a result, are less of a competitive force than in previous years. This compares to Aerospace Structures, which generally includes long-term sole-source or preferred supplier contracts and the success of these programs provides a strong foundation for our business and positions us well for future growth on new programs and new derivatives.\nOur only consolidated subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the First Lien Notes, 2022 Notes, the 2024 Notes and the 2025 Notes (the \"Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries\") are: (i) the receivables securitization special purpose entity, and (ii) the foreign operating subsidiaries.\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, we divested of a number of our assets and operations, including the transfer of the assets and certain liabilities associated with our Gulfstream G650 wing supply chain activities. Additionally, subsequent to March 31, 2021, we completed the sale of our composites manufacturing operations located in Milledgeville, Georgia, and Rayong, Thailand, as well as our manufacturing operations located in Red Oak, Texas. We recognized combined net losses of $104.7 million primarily from these transactions. These losses are presented on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations within loss on sale of assets and businesses, net. The operating results associated with the G650 wing supply chain activities and the composites and other manufacturing operations referred to above were included within Aerospace Structures through the date of transfer and through March 31, 2021, respectively. During the year ended March 31, 2021, these transactions represented, in the aggregate, approximately $266.2 million of the $1.87 billion of consolidated net sales (or approximately 14.2% of consolidated net sales).\nPursuant to the documentation governing the Senior Notes, we may redeem some or all of our Senior Notes prior to their stated maturities, subject to certain limitations set forth in the indenture governing the applicable Senior Notes and, in certain cases, subject to significant prepayment premiums. We are obligated to offer to repurchase the Senior Notes at specified prices as a result of certain change-of-control events and a sale of all or substantially all of our assets. These restrictions and prohibitions are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions.\nFiscal year ended March 31, 2020, compared with fiscal year ended March 31, 2019\n \u2022 The amount of interest expense and other we incur may be useful for investors to consider and may result in current cash inflows or outflows. However, we do not consider the amount of interest expense and other to be a representative component of the day-to-day operating performance of our business. \n \u2022 Using a portion of the proceeds from issuance of the First Lien Notes, we terminated the Revolving Credit Facility and fully repaid the $400.0 million borrowed thereunder. \nWe view Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP as operating performance measures and, as such, we believe that the U.S. GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to such measures is net loss. In calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP, we exclude from net loss the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the day-to-day operation of our business. We have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of these non-GAAP financial measures as a result of these exclusions. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP are not measurements of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity, as an alternative to net loss, or as an indicator of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDAP as a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measure, including net loss. In addition, we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP to net loss set forth below, in our earnings releases, and in other filings with the SEC and to carefully review the U.S. GAAP financial information included as part of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our Annual Reports on Form 10-K that are filed with the SEC, as well as our quarterly earnings releases, and compare the U.S. GAAP financial information with our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP.\nThe above table includes approximately $207.7 million of total contractual obligations pertaining to the manufacturing operations located in Milledgeville, Georgia, Rayong, Thailand, and Red Oak, Texas, that, subsequent to the closing of these transactions in May, are no longer contractual obligations of the Company. Of the $207.7 million total contractual obligations, approximately $183.1 million represented purchase obligations, of which approximately 78% were expected to be paid in less than one year. The majority of the remaining $24.6 million contractual obligations associated with these divestitures pertained to operating leases. The above table excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $11.8 million as of March 31, 2021, since we cannot predict with reasonable certainty the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities.\nCurrent plan documents reserve our right to amend or terminate the plans at any time, subject to applicable collective bargaining requirements for represented employees.\n\nNet Sales\nNet sales decreased by $1.03 billion, or 35.5%, to $1.87 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, from $2.90 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Organic sales adjusted for inter-segment sales decreased $782.3 million, or 29.9%, with additional declines from the Nashville and G650 divestitures of $248.1 million. Organic sales decreased primarily due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including temporarily idle facilities and certain production rate decreases primarily on commercial programs, planned reductions on sunsetting programs (i.e., 747-8, G280, G550), and the transitioned workscope on the E-2 Jet program. These declines were partially offset by increases in military platforms. Net sales for the year ended March 31, 2021, included $43.8 million in total nonrecurring revenues, as compared with $41.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2020.\n\nWe have taken a number of actions to improve liquidity. In March 2020, we suspended the declaration and/or payment of dividends until further notice. We have furloughed certain employees and announced reductions in force which were largely implemented in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2021. We have reduced discretionary spending as well as reduced or deferred research and development and capital expenditures. We are also working with our customers and supply chain to accelerate receipts and conserve cash. We have also deferred certain employer payroll tax payments pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ( CARES\u201d) Act. In September 2020, we submitted an application to the IRS requesting a change in the plan year for our U.S. pension plan. The change was designed to minimize the funding impact of the temporary market trough caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The IRS approved our application. As a result, our projected required pension contributions for the next three fiscal years were reduced by approximately $50.0 million. In addition, the pension funding relief provisions of the American Rescue Plan Act ( ARPA\u201d) further reduced our projected pension funding requirements by approximately an additional $200.0 million over the next six fiscal years. We expect to take advantage of additional programs if passed by the federal government.\nIncome Taxes\nCost of sales decreased by $617.5 million, or 21.1%, to $2.31 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, from $2.92 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Organic cost of sales adjusted for inter-segment sales increased $26.3 million, or 1.2%, offset by declines from the fiscal 2019 divestitures and fiscal 2020 divestitures, including the Global 7500 transition, of $645.6 million. Organic cost of sales increased primarily due to the higher volumes in the above programs partially offset by the prior year forward loss provisions from the adoption of ASU 2017-07 of $87.2 million. Organic gross margin for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, was 20.8% compared with 17.6% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. The gross margin for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, increased compared with the prior year period due to the nonrecurring forward loss provisions from the adoption of ASU 2017-07.\nThe income tax expense was $5.8 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, reflecting an effective tax rate of (24.5)%. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, we adjusted the valuation allowance against the consolidated net deferred tax asset by $36.9 million primarily due to an increase in the net operating loss and changes to temporary differences related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans. As of March 31, 2020, management determined that it was necessary to maintain a valuation allowance against principally all of our net deferred tax assets.\n\nOperating Margin and Adjusted EBITDAP Margin\n\nSignificant financial results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, include:\nAerospace Structures operating loss as a percentage of segment sales decreased to (32.9)% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, as compared with 2.7% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, due to the decrease in operating income as noted above. These same factors as noted above for the Adjusted EBITDAP contributed to the decrease in Adjusted EBITDAP margin to 2.2% from 6.6% year over year.\n \u2022 We entered into amendments to the Securitization Facility. The August amendments removed the covenants that required us to maintain certain financial ratios. As of March 31, 2021, the maximum amount available under the Receivables Securitization Facility was $75.0 million, and we have the ability to reduce the facility amount to not less than $50.0 million. The actual amount available under the Securitization Facility at any point in time is dependent upon the balance of eligible accounts receivables as well as the amount of letters of credit outstanding. At March 31, 2021, there was $0.0 million outstanding under our Securitization Facility. Interest rates on the Securitization Facility are based on prevailing market rates for short-term commercial paper, plus a program fee and a commitment fee. \nCost of sales decreased by $831.1 million, or 36.0%, to $1.48 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, from $2.31 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Organic cost of sales adjusted for inter-segment sales decreased $588.8 million, or 29.0%, with additional declines from the Nashville and G650 divestitures of $242.3 million. Organic cost of sales decreased primarily due to the lower volumes described above within our discussion of net sales and a $10.0 million partial reversal of prior loss reserves. These decreases were partially offset by an approximately $23.7 million impairment loss recognized in cost of sales on certain rotable inventory that primarily arose as a result of customer fleet retirement announcements resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCash flows provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, were $277.2 million, compared with cash flows provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, of $293.7 million. In March, we drew on our Credit Facility (as defined below), bringing the outstanding balance as of March 31, 2020, to $400.0 million. This was done as part of a comprehensive precautionary approach to increase our cash position and maximize our financial flexibility, in light of the current volatility in the global markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. In the year ended March 31, 2021, the following significant financing cash flow events occurred:\nThe following tables present summarized financial information of the Company and the Guarantor Subsidiaries on a combined basis. The combined summarized financial information eliminates intercompany balances and transactions among the Company and the Guarantor Subsidiaries and equity in earnings and investments in any Guarantor Subsidiaries or Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries. The summarized financial information is provided in accordance with the reporting requirements of Rule 13-01 under SEC Regulation S-X for the issuer and Guarantor Subsidiaries.\nPension Expense\n \u2022 We repaid the loans and other amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d), which was governed by the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of November 19, 2013 (as amended, the Revolving Credit Agreement\u201d) and terminated all commitment thereunder. The payment of $335.2 million was made using a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the First Lien Notes. We initially cash collateralized the letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Agreement but now have the ability to issue letters of credit under the Securitization Facility. \n\nWe report our financial performance based on the following two reportable segments: Systems & Support and Aerospace Structures. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") utilizes Adjusted EBITDAP as a primary measure of profitability to evaluate performance of our segments and allocate resources.\n \u2022 Amortization of acquired contract liabilities may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the noncash earnings on the fair value of off-market contracts acquired through acquisitions. We do not believe these earnings necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash earnings related to our operations. \n \u2022 We extinguished approximately $63.5 million of the outstanding balance under the 2022 Notes \nWe follow ASC 740, Income Taxes, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute criteria for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, as well as guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.\nAerospace Structures net sales decreased by $741.5 million, or 47.7%, to $814.4 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, from $1.56 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Organic net sales decreased by $493.5 million, with additional declines from the Nashville and G650 divestitures of $248.1 million. Organic net sales decreased due to the planned reductions on sunsetting programs (i.e., 747-8, G280, G550), the transitioned workscope on the E-2 Jets and G650 programs, as well as the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including temporarily idle facilities and certain production rate decreases primarily on commercial programs. Net sales for the year ended March 31, 2021, included $43.8 million in total nonrecurring revenues, as compared with $36.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2020.\nSystems & Support cost of sales decreased by $178.6 million, or 18.6%, to $781.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, from $960.5 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Gross margin for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, was 26.2% compared with 29.3% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Cost of sales decreased due to the sales decrease noted above as well as sales mix and the results of our restructuring and cost-reduction activities as well as a $10.0 million partial reversal of prior loss reserves. These decreases were partially offset by an approximately $23.7 million impairment loss recognized in cost of sales on certain rotable inventory that primarily arose as a result of customer fleet retirement announcements resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Gross margin decreased primarily as a result of the changes in sales mix and the impairment of rotable inventory, as cost-reduction actions offset absorption related increases.\nOperating Income and Adjusted EBITDAP\nThe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting production rate decreases primarily on commercial programs led to a reduction in the proportion of our sales mix arising from the commercial aerospace end market in both of our segments. The current year transfer of the assets and certain liabilities associated with our Gulfstream G650 wing supply chain activities and the fiscal 2020 divestitures led to reductions in our sales mix arising from the business jets end market and also contributed to the reductions in commercial aerospace within Aerospace Structures. Additionally, both Systems & Support and Aerospace Structures experienced increases in military end market sales primarily from volume on military rotorcraft.\nRevenue Recognition and Contract Balances\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP are used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and by investors as a supplemental financial measure to evaluate the performance of our business that, when viewed with our U.S. GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, we believe provides additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business. We have spent more than 20 years expanding our product and service capabilities, partially through acquisitions of complementary businesses. Due to the expansion of our operations, which included acquisitions, our net loss has included significant charges for depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP exclude these charges and provide meaningful information about the operating performance of our business, apart from charges for depreciation and amortization. We believe the disclosure of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year. We also believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP are measures of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of noncash charges, such as depreciation and amortization, and nonoperating items, such as interest, income taxes, pension and other postretirement benefits, provides additional information about our cost structure and, over time, helps track our operating progress. In addition, investors, securities analysts, and others have regularly relied on Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP to provide financial measures by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry.\nSystems & Support operating income as a percentage of segment sales increased to 10.7% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, as compared with 10.4% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, due to the factors described above. These same factors contributed to the decrease in Adjusted EBITDAP margin to 14.9% from 15.5% year over year, with the exception of the current year rotable inventory asset impairment and the prior year goodwill impairment, which are excluded from Adjusted EBITDAP.\nFunded status is derived by subtracting the respective year-end values of the projected benefit obligations ( PBO\u201d) from the fair value of plan assets. The sensitivity of the PBO to changes in the discount rate varies depending on the magnitude and direction of the change in the discount rate. Refer to Note 12 for a quantitative sensitivity analysis for the PBO.\nIn March 2020, in response to anticipated headwinds resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the aerospace industry, including the impact on global air travel, we implemented certain cost reduction actions to improve our financial health, align capacity with expected demand, and ensure our long-term competitiveness. This included the reduction of overhead and indirect staff and temporary workers and the selective implementation of furloughs across our business to reduce costs while delivering on customer commitments. Through these initiatives, combined with reductions in travel, corporate events, and other expenses, we achieved our cost reduction goals in fiscal year 2021. We also completed certain previously announced\nOperating Margin and Adjusted EBITDAP Margin\nCost of Sales and Gross Margin\nFrom fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2019, our Aerospace Structures business unit experienced operating and forward losses on our production of the Boeing 747-8 fuselage for Boeing, Gulfstream G280 wing for Israel Aerospace Industries, Ltd (\"IAI\") and Gulfstream G650 wing for Gulfstream. Further discussion is included below regarding the significant developments of each program as well as other significant programs.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \u2022 Net loss for fiscal 2021 was $450.9 million or $8.55 per diluted common share. \n\nCorporate operations incurred expenses of $172.0 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, as compared with $125.3 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. The corporate expenses increased because of increased loss on sale of assets and businesses of $37.7 million, increased restructuring costs of $7.5 million, and a $9.3 million gain on legal judgment in the prior fiscal year. These increases were partially offset by decreased subscription costs of $3.3 million and travel costs of $2.6 million.\nAerospace Structures:\nWe develop assumptions using relevant experience, in conjunction with market-related data for each plan. Assumptions are reviewed annually with third party consultants and adjusted as appropriate. Refer to Note 15 for details regarding the assumptions used to estimate projected benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost as they pertain to our defined benefit pension plans.\nThe Boeing 737 MAX program represented approximately 3% of revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. During the third fiscal quarter of the year ended March 31, 2021, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Ag\u00eancia Nacional de Avia\u00e7\u00e3o Civil of Brazil approved the 737 MAX return to flight which was quickly followed by Transport Canada and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency in January 2021. Boeing resumed 737 MAX deliveries in our third fiscal quarter of the year ended March 31, 2021, delivering 27 aircraft. Conditions are expected to improve as COVID-19 vaccination distribution accelerates, and Boeing has projected further 737 MAX rate increases in the latter half of calendar year 2021. The International Air Transport Association has predicted a 55% increase in passengers traveling in 2021 to 2.8 billion passengers.\nOperating Margin and Adjusted EBITDAP Margin\n \u2022 Net sales for fiscal 2021 decreased 35.5% to $1.87 billion. \nNon-service defined benefit income decreased by $16.1 million, or 28.5%, to $40.6 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, compared with $56.7 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to additional expense in the current year from pension settlements, special termination benefits, and curtailment losses of $64.6 million partially offset by a gain from curtailment of other post-employment benefits of $49.5 million, as well as changes in actuarial assumptions and experience which reduced income for fiscal year 2020 by $4.1 million.\n \u2022 Legal judgments and settlements, when applicable, may be useful for investors to consider because it reflects gains or losses from disputes with third parties. We do not believe these earnings necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash earnings related to our operations. \n \u2022 We issued $700.0 million principal amount of the First Lien Notes pursuant to an indenture among us, the Guarantor Subsidiaries (as defined below) and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the First Lien Notes Indenture\u201d). The First Lien Notes were sold at 100% of the principal amount and have an effective interest yield of 8.875%. \nCash flows provided by investing activities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, decreased $193.2 million from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Cash flows provided by investing activities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, included cash from the fiscal 2020 sales of assets and businesses of $47.2 million offset by capital expenditures of $39.8 million. Cash flows used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, included cash from the fiscal 2019 divestitures of $247.6 million, offset by capital expenditures of $47.1 million.\nCertain of our current and former employees participate in defined benefit pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans (collectively, referred to as defined benefit plans\u201d) in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, which we sponsor. The determination of projected benefit obligations and the recognition of expenses related to defined benefit pension plans are dependent on various assumptions. The most significant of these assumptions are the discount rates and the long-term expected rates of return on plan assets. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized for each plan to the extent required over the estimated future life expectancy of plan participants.\nSignificant Assumptions\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nNet Sales\nAerospace Structures operating income decreased by $309.6 million, or 739.5%, to an operating loss of $267.7 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, from operating income of $41.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Organic operating income decreased by $311.1 million, or 795.9%. The Nashville and G650 divestitures contributed approximately $4.3 million of operating income in the year ended March 31, 2021, which is consistent with the operating income contributed in the year ended March 31, 2020. The decreased organic operating income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, was primarily the result of the decreases noted above as well as the $252.4 million long-lived asset impairment described above and an increase in restructuring costs of $32.2 million partially offset by decreased administrative compensation cost of $11.1 million and intangible asset amortization expense of $26.7 million, the latter being the result of the reduction in the carrying value of the long-lived assets impaired in the first quarter impairment as disclosed in Note 2. The increase in Adjusted EBITDAP year over year is due to the same factors that increased operating income, except for the long-lived asset impairment charges, which are excluded from Adjusted EBITDAP.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOrganic gross margin for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, was 21.1% compared with 22.1% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. The gross margin for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, decreased primarily as a result of the impairment of rotable asset inventory as cost-reduction actions and certain favorable customer settlements offset absorption related increases. Gross margin for the year ended March 31, 2021, included net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments on long-term contracts of $12.3 million. The favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments to operating income included gross favorable adjustments of $55.2 million and gross unfavorable adjustments of $42.8 million. Gross margins for the year ended March 31, 2020, included net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $22.8 million.\nSegment operating income increased by $134.5 million, or 276.3%, to $183.2 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, from $48.7 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Organic segment operating income increased by $45.1 million, or 31.7%,\nRefer to Note 2 for disclosure of the effects of recently issued accounting guidance.\n\nThe following table shows our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP reconciled to our net loss for the indicated periods (in thousands):\nCash flows provided by investing activities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, decreased $16.7 million from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, to cash used in investing activities of $9.3 million compared with cash provided by investing activities of $7.4 million. Cash flows provided by investing activities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, included cash from the sale of assets and businesses of $15.9 million offset by capital expenditures of $25.2 million. Cash flows used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, included cash from the fiscal 2020 divestitures of $47.2 million offset by capital expenditures of $39.8 million. We currently expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2022 to be in the range of $30.0 million, of which approximately $22.0 million pertains to our core Systems & Support operating segment. The majority of our fiscal 2022 capital expenditures are capital investments designed to improve our manufacturing efficiency and expand our capabilities.\nCorporate operations incurred expenses of $125.3 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, as compared with $323.4 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. The corporate expenses included decreased loss on sale of assets and businesses of $168.3 million, decreased compensation cost of $12.3 million, with additional benefit from the legal judgment gain of $9.3 million.\n\nAerospace Structures operating income as a percentage of segment sales increased to 2.7% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, as compared with (7.4)% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, due to the increase in operating income as noted above. These same factors as noted above for the Adjusted EBITDAP contributed to the increased Adjusted EBITDAP margin year over year.\n \u2022 As part of these transactions, we paid approximately $20.7 million in deferred financing costs. \n\nOur accounting policy regarding revenue recognition is disclosed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. As described in Note 2, for certain contracts and performance obligations, we are required to exercise judgment when developing assumptions regarding expected total costs to fulfill performance obligations, variable consideration, and the standalone selling price of a performance obligation. These assumptions are most significant within the Aerospace Structures business segment because the size and long-term nature of our contracts with customers. Specifically, assumptions regarding the total costs require significant judgment with regard to materials, labor, and overhead costs that are affected by our ability to achieve technical requirements and schedule requirements, as well as our estimation of internal and subcontractor performance projections, anticipated volume, asset utilization, labor agreements, and inflation trends. We continually review and update our assumptions based on market trends and program performance. When we satisfy a performance obligation and recognize revenue over time, material changes in assumptions may result in positive or negative cumulative catch-up adjustments related to revenues previously recognized or, in some cases, forward loss contract reserves.\nNon-service Defined Benefit Income\nNon-service defined benefit income increased by $8.9 million, or 22.0%, to $49.5 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, compared with $40.6 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to prior year expenses from pension settlements, special termination benefits, and curtailment losses of $64.6 million partially offset by a prior year gain from curtailment of other post-employment benefits of $49.5 million, partially offset by changes in actuarial assumptions and experience which reduced income for the year ended March 31, 2021, by $6.3 million.\nSegment Operating Income\nBoeing 737 MAX\nCost of Sales and Gross Margin\nterms favorable to us, if at all. We may also seek transactions to extend the maturity of our indebtedness, reduce leverage, or decrease interest expense. Such transactions could include one or more repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding indebtedness. These transactions could increase our total amount of secured indebtedness or be dilutive to stockholders. There can be no assurances if or when we will consummate any such transactions or the timing thereof.\nNet Sales\nWe are a major supplier to the aerospace industry and have two reportable segments: (i) Systems & Support, whose companies' revenues are derived from integrated solutions, including design, development and support of proprietary components, subsystems and systems, production of complex assemblies using external designs, as well as full life cycle solutions for commercial, regional and military aircraft; and (ii) Aerospace Structures, whose companies supply commercial, business, regional, and military manufacturers with large metallic and composite structures and produce close-tolerance parts primarily to customer designs and model-based definition, including a wide range of aluminum, hard metal and composite structure capabilities.\nCost of Sales and Gross Margin\nThe income tax expense was $2.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, reflecting an effective tax rate of (0.7)%. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, we adjusted the valuation allowance against the consolidated net deferred tax asset by $73.9 million primarily due to an increase in the net operating loss and changes to temporary differences related to interest disallowance, long-lived intangible asset impairment, and pension and other postretirement benefit plans. As of March 31, 2021, management determined that it was necessary to maintain a valuation allowance against principally all of our net deferred tax assets.\n\n \u2022 We fully repaid the $75.0 million borrowed as of March 31, 2020, under our Receivables Securitization Facility. \nInterest expense and other increased by $7.5 million, or 6.6%, to $122.1 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, compared with $114.6 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, due to higher interest rates and relative debt levels.\nIn addition to the financial obligations detailed in the table above, we also had obligations related to our benefit plans at March 31, 2021, as detailed in the following table. Our other postretirement benefits are not required to be funded in advance, so benefit payments are paid as they are incurred. Our expected net contributions and payments are included in the table below:\nOur expected future cash flows for the next five years for long-term debt, leases and other obligations are as follows:\nThe following tables show our Adjusted EBITDAP by reportable segment reconciled to our operating (loss) income for the indicated periods (in thousands):\nInterest Expense and Other\nThe First Lien Notes, the 6.250% Senior Secured Notes due September 15, 2024 (the 2024 Notes\u201d),and the guarantees are secured, subject to permitted liens, by second-priority liens on all of our assets and our subsidiary guarantors (the Collateral\u201d) that secure all of the indebtedness under certain hedging and cash management obligations. The First Lien Notes and the 2024 Notes and the guarantees are not secured by the assets of Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries. Some of our assets are excluded from the Collateral, including our real property assets.\nimpairment. We applied a discount rate of 15.0% to the estimated future excess earnings and cash flows of the asset group in order to estimate the fair value of the asset group as of the measurement date and recognized a total noncash impairment charge of $252.4 million, primarily allocated to definite-lived intangible assets.\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, we had a net cash inflow of $96.7 million from operating activities, an increase of $271.1 million, compared with a net cash outflow of $174.4 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. We liquidated approximately $89.0 million in prior period customer advances against current period deliveries. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, we invested in inventory to support ramping and existing programs.\nNet sales decreased by $464.8 million, or 13.8%, to $2.90 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, from $3.36 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Organic sales adjusted for inter-segment sales increased $140.5 million, or 5.2%, offset by declines from the fiscal 2019 divestitures and fiscal 2020 divestitures, including the Global 7500 transition, of $605.3 million. Organic sales increased primarily due to increased volumes across Airbus commercial programs and various military programs, as well as aftermarket demand for military rotorcraft programs in Systems & Support, increased volumes on G550, 767, 787, G280, and M100 programs as well as increased volume and pricing on E-2 Jets sales to ASTK in Aerospace Structures, and increased demand for accessory components. These increases were partially offset in decreased volumes on 737.\nSegment Operating Income\n \u2022 Non-service defined benefit income or expense from our pension and other postretirement benefit plans (inclusive of the adoption of ASU 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, and certain pension related transactions such as curtailments, settlements, early retirement or other incentives) may be useful for investors to consider because they represent the cost of postretirement benefits to plan participants, net of the assumption of returns on the plan's assets and are not indicative of the cash paid for such benefits. We do not believe these earnings (expenses) necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash earnings related to our operations. \nCost of Sales and Gross Margin",

    "summary": " This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations summarizes Triumph Group's financial performance and condition for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019. Key points include:\n\n- Net sales for fiscal 2021 decreased 35.5% to $1.87 billion, primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Operating loss was $326.2 million. Net loss was $450.9 million or $8.55 per diluted share. \n\n- Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAP, non-GAAP measures, were $158.9 million and $109.4 million for fiscal 2021. This compares to Adjusted EBITDA of $296.5 million and Adjusted EBITDAP of $241.6 million for fiscal 2020.\n\n- The company took several actions to improve liquidity, including cost reductions, suspending dividends, and refinancing debt. It believes it has sufficient liquidity for the next 12 months.\n\n- Net sales for fiscal 2020 decreased 13.8% to $2.90 billion. Operating income was $57.9 million compared to an operating loss of $274.7 million in fiscal 2019. \n\n- The commercial aerospace end market was impacted by COVID-19 while the military end market increased. Programs like the Boeing 747-8 and 737 MAX were impacted.\n\n- The company completed several divestitures in fiscal 2020 and 2021 including composites operations and G650 wing supply chain activities. This impacted results.\n\nIn summary, Triumph's financial results declined significantly in fiscal 2021 due to the pandemic's impact, especially on commercial aerospace. The company took actions to cut costs and raise liquidity to weather the downturn."
