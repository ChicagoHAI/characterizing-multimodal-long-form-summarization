MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nYou should read this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and consolidated results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements, related notes and other financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions, contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. Please also see the section titled Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nFor the discussion of the financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, refer to \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of Operations\" and \"-Liquidity and Capital Resources\" included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on March 11, 2021.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a novel class of medicines, which we refer to as Bicycles, for diseases that are underserved by existing therapeutics. Bicycles are fully synthetic short peptides constrained to form two loops which stabilize their structural geometry. This constraint facilitates target binding with high affinity and selectivity, making Bicycles attractive candidates for drug development. Bicycles are a unique therapeutic modality combining the pharmacology usually associated with a biologic with the manufacturing and pharmacokinetic, or PK, properties of a small molecule. The relatively large surface area presented by Bicycles allow targets to be drugged that have historically been intractable to non-biological approaches. Bicycles are excreted by the kidney rather than the liver and have shown no signs of immunogenicity to date, which we believe together support a favorable toxicological profile.\nWe have a novel and proprietary phage display screening platform which we use to identify Bicycles in an efficient manner. The platform initially displays linear peptides on the surface of engineered bacteriophages, or phages, before on-phage\u201d cyclization with a range of small molecule scaffolds which can confer differentiated physicochemical and structural properties. Our platform encodes quadrillions of potential Bicycles which can be screened to identify molecules for optimization to potential product candidates. We have used this powerful screening technology to identify our current portfolio of candidates in oncology and intend to use it in conjunction with our collaborators to seek to develop additional future candidates across a range of other disease areas.\nOur product candidates BT5528, BT8009, and BT1718 are each a Bicycle\u00ae Toxin Conjugate, or BTC\u2122. These Bicycles are chemically attached to a toxin that when administered is cleaved from the Bicycle and kills the tumor cells. We are evaluating BT5528, a second-generation BTC targeting Ephrin type A receptor 2, or EphA2, in a company-sponsored Phase I/II clinical trial and BT8009, a second-generation BTC targeting Nectin-4, in a company-sponsored Phase I/II clinical trial. In addition, BT1718 is being developed to target tumors that express Membrane Type 1 matrix metalloproteinase, or MT1 MMP, and is being investigated for safety, tolerability and efficacy in an ongoing Phase I/IIa clinical trial sponsored and fully funded by the Cancer Research UK Centre for Drug Development, or Cancer Research UK. In addition, our product candidates BT7480 and BT7455, are each a Bicycle tumor-targeted immune cell agonist\u00ae, or Bicycle TICATM. A Bicycle TICA links immune cell receptor binding Bicycles to tumor antigen binding Bicycles. We are evaluating BT7480, a Bicycle TICA targeting Nectin-4 and agonizing CD137, in a company-sponsored Phase I/II clinical trial, and IND-enabling studies for BT7455, an EphA2/CD137 Bicycle TICA, are ongoing. Our discovery pipeline in oncology includes Bicycle-based systemic immune cell agonists and Bicycle TICAs.\nBeyond our wholly owned oncology portfolio, we are collaborating with biopharmaceutical companies and organizations in therapeutic areas in which we believe our proprietary Bicycle screening platform can identify therapies to treat diseases with significant unmet medical need. Our partnered programs include collaborations in immuno-\noncology, anti-infective, cardiovascular, ophthalmology, dementia, central nervous system, neuromuscular and respiratory indications.\nCOVID-19 Business Update\nIn 2020, with the global spread of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we established a cross-functional task force and implemented business continuity plans designed to address and mitigate the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our employees, customers and our business. While we continue to experience limited financial and operational impacts at this time, given the global economic slowdown, the overall disruption of global healthcare systems and the other risks and uncertainties associated with the pandemic, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects could be materially adversely affected. We continue to closely monitor the ongoing COVID-19 situation as we evolve our business continuity plans and response strategy. Our laboratories in the United Kingdom and the United States remain operational. We have implemented plans that allow non-laboratory based employees to return to the office, with a focus on employee safety and optimal work environment. However, many non-laboratory based employees continue to work remotely. In light of continually changing circumstances regarding infection rates and local government recommendations, or if additional restrictions emerge as a result of COVID-19 variants, we may be required to suspend or reverse efforts to return to the office in the future.\nClinical Development\nWith respect to clinical development, our CROs have taken measures to utilize remote and virtual approaches, as necessary, including remote patient monitoring where possible, to maintain patient safety and trial continuity and to preserve trial integrity. While we have not experienced a material impact to our business, during the first half of 2020, all clinical sites for the Phase I/IIa trial of BT1718 being conducted by CRUK in the United Kingdom temporarily paused enrollment of new patients due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pause in enrollment was lifted during the second quarter of 2020 and patient enrollment in the Phase IIa portion of the clinical trial remains underway. We are also currently enrolling patients in ongoing Phase I/II clinical trials for BT5528, BT8009 and BT7480. Clinical trial sites have remained open and activities are ongoing. However, changes in circumstances related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could result in future pauses in or other impacts on enrollment. We could also see an impact on the ability to supply study drug, report trial results, or interact with regulators, ethics committees or other important agencies due to limitations in regulatory authority employee resources or otherwise. In addition, we rely on contract research organizations or other third parties to assist us with clinical trials, and we cannot guarantee that they will continue to perform their contractual duties in a timely and satisfactory manner as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. If the COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbated or persists for an extended period of time, or if additional new variants of COVID-19 emerge, we could experience significant disruptions to our clinical development timelines, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nSupply Chain\nAs for our third-party manufacturers, distributors and other partners, we are working closely with them to manage our supply chain activities and mitigate potential disruptions to our clinical trial materials and supplies as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We currently expect to have adequate global supply of clinical trial materials and supplies to support our current clinical trial activities. If the COVID-19 pandemic persists for an extended period of time or begins to impact essential distribution systems such as FedEx and postal delivery, we could experience disruptions to our supply chain and operations, and associated delays in the manufacturing and supply of our products, which would adversely impact our ability to provide investigational product to our clinical trial sites and to generate sales of and revenues from our approved products, if approved.\nOther Financial and Corporate Impacts\nThe impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations and financial results, clinical development and regulatory efforts, corporate development objectives and the value of and market for our ADSs, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence at this time, such as the ultimate duration of the pandemic, travel restrictions, quarantines, social distancing and business closure\nrequirements in the United Kingdom, United States, Europe and other countries, and the effectiveness of actions taken globally to contain and treat the disease. If remote work policies for certain portions of our business, or that of our business partners, are extended longer than we currently expect or are reimposed due to increased incidence or infection rates, we may need to reassess our priorities and our corporate objectives. Additionally, our operations, ability to timely and accurately report financial results, the operating effectiveness of our internal controls, and the security of our informational technology and systems could be impacted.\nFinancial Overview\nSince our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing our Bicycle platform and our product candidates, BT5528, BT8009, BT1718, BT7480, BT7455 and BT7401, conducting research and development of our product candidates and preclinical programs, raising capital and providing general and administrative support for our operations. To date, we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from the sale of our American Depositary Shares, or ADSs, ordinary shares, and convertible preferred shares, proceeds received from upfront payments, research and development payments, and development milestone payments from our collaboration agreements with Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc, or Ionis, Genentech Inc., or Genentech, the Dementia Discovery Fund, or DDF, Sanofi (formerly Bioverativ Inc.), AstraZeneca AB, or AstraZeneca and Oxurion NV, or Oxurion; and borrowings pursuant to our debt facility with Hercules Capital, Inc., or Hercules. From our inception in 2009 through December 31, 2021, we have received gross proceeds of $557.6 million from the sale of ADSs, ordinary shares and convertible preferred shares, including the proceeds from our initial public offering, follow-on offering and at-the-market, or ATM, offering program; and $124.2 million of cash payments under our collaboration revenue arrangements, including $46.6 million from Ionis, $43.0 million from Genentech, $1.7 million from DDF, $10.3 million from AstraZeneca, $15.0 million from Sanofi, $6.6 million from Oxurion; and borrowings of $30.0 million pursuant to our Loan and Security Agreement, or Loan Agreement, with Hercules. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. Our net losses were $66.8 million, $51.0 million and $30.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $218.4 million. These losses have resulted primarily from costs incurred in connection with research and development activities and general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe anticipate that our expenses and capital requirements will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the preclinical activities and clinical trials of our product candidates and, if any product candidates are approved, pursue the commercialization of such product candidates by building internal sales and marketing capabilities. We expect that our expenses and capital requirements will increase substantially if and as we:\nTable 288: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>continue our development of our product candidates, including conducting future clinical trials of BT5528, BT8009, BT7480 and BT1718; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 289: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>progress the preclinical and clinical development of BT7455 and BT7401; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 290: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>seek to identify and develop additional product candidates; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 291: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>develop the necessary processes, controls and manufacturing data to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates and to support manufacturing to commercial scale; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 292: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>develop, maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 293: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>seek marketing approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, if any; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 294: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>hire and retain additional personnel, such as non-clinical, clinical, pharmacovigilance, quality assurance, regulatory affairs, manufacturing, distribution, legal, compliance, medical affairs, commercial and scientific personnel; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 295: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>acquire or in-license other products and technologies; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 296: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>expand our infrastructure and facilities to accommodate our growing employee base, including adding equipment and infrastructure to support our research and development; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 297: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our research and development programs, any future commercialization efforts and our operations as a public company and large accelerated filer. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe do not expect to generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates, which we expect will take many years and is subject to significant uncertainty. We have no commercial-scale manufacturing facilities of our own, and all of our manufacturing activities have been and are planned to be contracted out to third parties. Additionally, we currently utilize third-party contract research organizations, or CROs, to carry out many of our clinical development activities. If we seek to obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates from which we obtain promising results in clinical development, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses as we prepare for product sales, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution.\nAs a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, charitable and governmental grants, monetization transactions or licensing arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back, or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has already resulted in a significant disruption of global financial markets. If the disruption persists and deepens, whether as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, we could experience an inability to access additional capital.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $438.7 million. We believe that our existing cash will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least 12 months from the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could deplete our available capital resources sooner than we expect. See - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nCollaboration Revenues\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and we do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales for the foreseeable future. Our revenue primarily consists of collaboration revenue under our arrangements with our collaboration partners, including amounts that are recognized related to upfront payments, milestone payments and option exercise payments, and amounts due to us for research and development services. In the future, revenue may include additional milestone payments and option exercise payments, and royalties on any net\nproduct sales under our collaborations. We expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from period to period as a result of the timing and amount of license, research and development services, milestone and other payments.\nExpenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research and development activities, including our discovery efforts, and the development of our product candidates, which include:\nTable 298: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>employee-related expenses including salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation expense; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 299: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>expenses incurred under agreements with third parties that conduct research and development, preclinical activities, clinical activities and manufacturing on our behalf; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 300: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the cost of consultants; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 301: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the cost of lab supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing preclinical study materials and clinical trial materials; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 302: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 303: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>facilities, depreciation, and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, and other operating costs. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs for certain activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual agreements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as a prepaid expense or accrued research and development expenses. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are capitalized. The capitalized amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.\nU.K. research and development tax credits and government grant funding are recorded as an offset to research and development expense. See -Benefit from Income Taxes.\u201d\nOur direct external research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis and consist of costs, such as fees paid to consultants, contractors and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, in connection with our preclinical and clinical development activities. Costs incurred after a product candidate has been designated and that are directly related to the product candidate are included in direct research and development expenses for that program. Costs incurred prior to designating a product candidate are included in other discovery and platform related expense. We do not allocate employee costs, costs associated with our discovery efforts, laboratory supplies, and facilities, including depreciation or other indirect costs, to specific product development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product development programs and, as such, are not separately classified.\nIn December 2016, we entered into a Clinical Trial and License Agreement with Cancer Research Technology Limited, or CRTL and Cancer Research UK, pursuant to which the Cancer Research UK Centre for Drug Development is sponsoring and funding a Phase I/IIa clinical trial for our product candidate, BT1718, in patients with advanced solid tumors. Cancer Research UK has designed and prepared and is carrying out and sponsoring the clinical trial at its own cost. Upon the completion of the Phase I/IIa clinical trial, we have the right to obtain a license to the results of the clinical trial upon the payment of a milestone, in cash and ordinary shares, with a combined value in the mid six digit dollar amount. If such license is not acquired, or if it is acquired and the license is terminated and we decide to abandon development of all products that deliver cytotoxic payloads to the MT1 target antigen, CRTL may elect to receive an assignment and exclusive license to develop and commercialize the product on a revenue sharing basis (in which case\nwe will receive tiered royalties of 70% to 90% of the net revenue depending on the stage of development when the license is granted is less certain costs, as defined in the agreement). The Cancer Research UK Agreement contains additional future milestone payments upon the achievement of development, regulatory and commercial milestones, payable in cash and shares, with an aggregate total value of $50.9 million, as well as royalty payments based on a single digit percentage on net sales of products developed. The Cancer Research UK Agreement can be terminated by either party upon an insolvency event, material breach of the terms of the contract, upon a change in control involving a tobacco related entity, and in certain other specified circumstances, and includes provisions that require the repayment of costs to Cancer Research UK upon certain termination events or change in control events. The costs incurred by Cancer Research UK are recorded as a liability in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development as the payments are not based solely on the results of the research and development having future economic benefit. The liability is recorded as incremental research and development expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Upon the completion of the Phase IIa part of the clinical trial, we expect research and development expenses to increase significantly as we expect to fund the continued development of BT1718, as well as incur additional development milestone payments.\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase for the foreseeable future as a result of our expanded portfolio of product candidates and as we: (i) continue the clinical development and seek to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates, including BT5528, BT8009, BT7480 and BT1718; (ii) initiate clinical trials for our product candidates, including BT7455; and (iii) build our in-house process development and analytical capabilities and continue to discover and develop additional product candidates.\nThe successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. As such, at this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of these product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from our product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing products, including the uncertainty of:\nTable 304: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>whether our business will be adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which could materially affect our operations, delay our research efforts and clinical trials and cause significant disruption in the operations and business of third-party manufacturers, contract research organizations, or CROs, other service providers, and collaborators with whom we conduct business; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 305: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>completing research and preclinical development of our product candidates, including conducting future clinical trials of BT5528, BT8009, BT7480 and BT1718; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 306: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>progressing the preclinical and clinical development of BT7455 and BT7401; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 307: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>establishing an appropriate safety profile with IND-enabling studies to advance our preclinical programs into clinical development; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 308: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>identifying new product candidates to add to our development pipeline; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 309: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>successful enrollment in, and the initiation and completion of clinical trials; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 310: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the timing, receipt and terms of any marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 311: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>commercializing the product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 312: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third party manufacturers; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 313: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the development and timely delivery of commercial-grade drug formulations that can be used in our clinical trials; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 314: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>addressing any competing technological and market developments, as well as any changes in governmental regulations; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 315: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>negotiating favorable terms in any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter and performing our obligations under such arrangements; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 316: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>maintaining, protecting and expanding our portfolio of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets and know-how, as well as obtaining and maintaining regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 317: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>continued acceptable safety profile of the drugs following approval; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 318: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>attracting, hiring and retaining qualified personnel. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, the FDA, EMA or another regulatory authority may require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or we may experience significant trial delays due to patient enrollment or other reasons, including the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, in which case we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. For instance, all clinical sites for the Phase I/IIa trial of BT1718 being conducted by Cancer Research UK in the United Kingdom, temporarily paused enrollment of new patients due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic during the first half of 2020. The pause in enrollment was lifted in the second quarter of 2020, and patient enrollment in the Phase IIa portion of the clinical trial is again underway. However, changes in circumstances related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could result in future pauses in or other impacts on enrollment. In addition, we may obtain unexpected results from our clinical trials, and we may elect to discontinue, delay or modify clinical trials of some product candidates or focus on others. Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including share-based compensation, for personnel in our executive, finance, corporate and business development and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include professional fees for legal, patent, accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services, insurance, travel expenses and facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs.\nForeign currency transactions in currencies different from the functional currency of our UK entities are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange differences resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at period-end exchange rates in foreign currencies are recorded in general and administrative expense in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss. As such, our operating expenses may be impacted by future changes in exchange rates. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks\u201d for further discussion.\nWe expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our general and administrative headcount to support our continued research and development and potential commercialization of our portfolio of product candidates. We also expect to incur increased expenses associated with being a public company and large accelerated filer, including costs of accounting, audit, information systems, legal, intellectual property, regulatory and tax compliance services, director and officer insurance costs and investor and public relations costs.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents held in operating accounts.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest expense for financing arrangements. On September 30, 2020, we entered into the Loan Agreement with Hercules and borrowed $15.0 million. On March 10, 2021, we entered into the First Amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement and borrowed an additional $15.0 million. Consequently, we expect interest expense to increase in future periods.\nOther Expense, net\nPrior to our IPO, other expense, net consisted primarily of changes in the fair value associated with the remeasurement of the warrant liability for warrants we issued to subscribe for Series A and Series B1 convertible preferred shares. We remeasured the warrant liability at fair value at each reporting period until completion of our IPO in May 2019. Upon the completion of the IPO, the respective warrants were exercised or converted to warrants to subscribe for ordinary shares, and as such, we will not incur additional expense related to the remeasurement of the warrant liability in future periods.\nBenefit From Income Taxes\nWe are subject to corporate taxation in the United States and the United Kingdom. We have generated losses since inception and have therefore not paid United Kingdom corporation tax. The benefit from income taxes presented in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss is mainly the result of deferred tax assets benefited in the United States that do not have a valuation allowance against them because of profits that will be generated by an intercompany service agreement.\nThe research and development tax credit received in the United Kingdom is recorded as a reduction to research and development expenses. The U.K. research and development tax credit, as described below, is fully refundable to us after surrendering tax losses and is not dependent on current or future taxable income. As a result, we have recorded the entire benefit from the U.K. research and development tax credit as a reduction to research and development expenses and is not reflected as part of the income tax provision. If, in the future, any U.K. research and development tax credits generated are needed to offset a corporate income tax liability in the United Kingdom, that portion would be recorded as a benefit within the income tax provision and any refundable portion not dependent on taxable income would continue to be recorded as a reduction to research and development expenses.\nAs a company that carries out extensive research and development activities, we seek to benefit from one of two U.K. research and development tax credit cash rebate regimes: The Small and Medium-sized Enterprises R&D Tax Credit Program, or SME Program, and the Research and Development Expenditure program, or RDEC Program. Qualifying expenditures largely comprise employment costs for research staff, consumables expenses incurred under agreements with third parties that conduct research and development, preclinical activities, clinical activities and manufacturing on our behalf and certain internal overhead costs incurred as part of research projects.\nBased on criteria established by U.K. law, a portion of expenditures being carried out in relation to our pipeline research and development, clinical trials management and manufacturing development activities were eligible for the SME Program for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nUnsurrendered U.K. losses may be carried forward indefinitely to be offset against future taxable profits, subject to numerous utilization criteria and restrictions. The amount that can be offset each year is limited to \u00a35.0 million plus an incremental 50% of U.K. taxable profits. After accounting for tax credits receivable, we had accumulated tax losses for carry forward in the United Kingdom of $120.3 million and $72.0 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nValue Added Tax, or VAT, is broadly charged on all taxable supplies of goods and services by VAT-registered businesses. Under current rates, an amount of 20% of the value, as determined for VAT purposes, of the goods or services supplied is added to all sales invoices and is payable to HMRC. Similarly, VAT paid on purchase invoices is generally reclaimable from HMRC and is included as a component of prepaid and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 319: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase of $4.2 million from our collaboration with Ionis entered into in July 2021 and an increase of $0.8 million from our collaboration with Genentech entered into in February 2020, offset by a $2.4 million decrease related to our collaboration with Oxurion due to a milestone achieved for the initiation of a Phase II trial of THR-149 in 2020, and a decrease of $1.3 million from our collaboration arrangement with AstraZeneca as AstraZeneca exercised its right to terminate a collaboration program, which resulted in the recognition of revenue of $1.5 million in 2020 for amounts allocated to a material right when an option expired.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe following table

development expenses increased by $11.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase of $9.0 million in direct program spend, primarily associated with increased clinical program development expenses for BT8009, Bicycle TICA, and other discovery and platform related expenses, including costs of our collaboration agreements and U.K. government grant activities, an increase of $5.2 million in employee and contractor related expenses attributable to increased headcount\nand an increase of $2.4 million of incremental share-based compensation expense. These increases were offset by a $4.9 million increase in research and development incentives, including U.K. research and development tax credit reimbursement due to the corresponding increase in research and development spending in the United Kingdom and $2.3 million associated with U.K. government grants.\nWe begin to separately track program expenses beginning at candidate nomination and accumulate all costs incurred to support each program to date. Through December 31, 2021, we have incurred approximately $19.7 million, $18.7 million, $14.3 million and $11.3 million of direct expenses for the development of the BT5528, BT8009, BT1718 and Bicycle TICA programs, respectively.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses for the years presented:\nTable 322: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personnel related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 9,783\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 6,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 3,289\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional and consulting fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,027)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other general and administration costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,557\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,198\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of foreign exchange rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (358)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (575)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 217\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 32,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 29,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 3,234\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $3.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase is primarily due to an increase of $3.3 million in personnel related costs attributable to increased headcount, an increase of $3.2 million in share-based compensation, and an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates in the amount of $0.2 million, as well as an increase of $1.6 million in other general and administrative costs, including insurance expense, to support operations as a public company, offset by a decrease of $5.0 million in professional and consulting fees, primarily associated with a decrease in external legal costs including $4.7 million of expense related to the settlement and license agreement with Pepscan entered into in November 2020.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net decreased by $3.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to interest expense related to our Loan Agreement, entered into in September 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nFrom our inception through December 31, 2021, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We do not expect to generate significant revenue from sales of any products for several years, if at all.\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from the sale of our ADSs, ordinary shares, and convertible preferred shares; proceeds received from upfront payments, payments for research and development services and development milestone payments pursuant to our collaboration agreements with Ionis, Genentech, DDF, AstraZeneca, Sanofi and Oxurion; and borrowings pursuant to our Loan Agreement.\nFrom our inception in 2009 through December 31, 2021, we have received gross proceeds of $557.6 million from the sale of ADSs, ordinary shares, and convertible preferred shares, including the proceeds from our IPO and 2021 follow-on offering and from our at-the-market, or ATM, offering program; $124.2 million of cash payments under our collaboration revenue arrangements including, $46.6 million from Ionis, $43.0 million from Genentech, $1.7 million from DDF, $10.3 million from AstraZeneca, $15.0 million from Sanofi and $6.6 million from Oxurion; and $30.0 million in borrowings pursuant to our Loan Agreement.

Borrowings under the Loan Agreement bear interest at an annual rate equal to the greater of (i) 8.85% and (ii) the prime rate of interest plus 5.60%. On March 10, 2021, or the Amendment Closing Date, we entered into the First Amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement, or First Amendment to LSA, with Hercules, in its capacity as administrative agent and collateral agent, and the lenders named in the First Amendment to LSA. Pursuant to the First Amendment to LSA, payments on borrowings under our debt facility with Hercules were interest-only until the first payment due on August 1, 2023, followed by equal monthly payments of principal and interest through October 1, 2024, or the Maturity Date. If we achieved certain performance milestones, the interest-only period could be extended, with the first principal payment due on February 1, 2024. On the Amendment Closing Date and pursuant to the terms of the First Amendment to LSA, we borrowed the additional term loan of $15.0 million that had been available from September 30, 2020 to March 15, 2021. In November 2021, the performance milestones were achieved, and the interest only period was extended until February 1, 2024, and the additional $10.0 million is available to be borrowed. We may prepay all or any portion greater than $5.0 million of the outstanding borrowings, subject to a prepayment premium equal to 2.0% of the principal amount outstanding if the prepayment occurs during the first year following the Closing Date, 1.5% of the principal amount outstanding if the prepayment occurs during the second year following the Closing Date; and 1.0% thereafter but prior to the Maturity Date. The Loan Agreement also provides for an end of term charge, payable upon maturity or the repayment of obligations under the Loan Agreement, equal to 5.0% of the principal amount repaid. In connection with the Loan Agreement, we granted Hercules a security interest in substantially all of our personal property and other assets, other than our intellectual property. In addition, the Loan Agreement contains customary affirmative and restrictive covenants and representations and warranties, including a covenant against the occurrence of a change in control (as defined in the Loan Agreement), financial reporting obligations, and certain limitations on indebtedness, liens (including a negative pledge on intellectual property and other assets), investments, distributions (including dividends), collateral, investments, transfers, mergers or acquisitions, taxes, corporate changes, and deposit accounts. The Loan Agreement also includes customary events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of covenants following any applicable cure period, the occurrence of certain events that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect\u201d as set forth in the Loan Agreement, cross acceleration to third-party indebtedness and certain events relating to bankruptcy or insolvency.

These payments are not included in the table above since the contracts are generally cancelable with advanced written notice, with a notice period of 90 days or less. From the time of notice until termination, we are contractually obligated to make certain minimum payments to the vendors, based on the timing of the notification and the exact terms of the agreement.\nOur arrangements with Cancer Research UK provide for additional future milestone payments upon the achievement of development, regulatory and commercial milestones, payable in cash and shares, with an aggregate total value of $111.2 million, as well as royalty payments based on a single digit percentage on net sales of products developed. In addition, in November 2020, we entered into a settlement and license agreement with Pepscan Systems\nB.V. regarding our use of Pepscan's CLIPS peptide technology, which agreement provides for additional future milestone payments by us upon the achievement of development, regulatory and commercial milestones, with an aggregate total value of $92.4 million. We have not included future payments under this agreement in the table above since these obligations are contingent upon future events. As of December 31, 2021, we were unable to estimate the timing or likelihood of achieving these milestones.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $438.7 million. We expect that our existing cash will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least 12 months from the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of product candidates and programs, and because the extent to which we may enter into collaborations with third parties for development of our product candidates is unknown, we are unable to estimate the timing and amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with completing the research and development of our product candidates. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\nTable 337: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>our ability to raise capital in light of the impacts of the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic on the global financial markets; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 338: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the scope, progress, results, and costs of drug discovery, preclinical development, laboratory testing, and clinical trials for the product candidates we may develop; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 339: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>our ability to enroll clinical trials in a timely manner and to quickly resolve any delays or clinical holds that may be imposed on our development programs, particularly in light of the global COVID-19 pandemic; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 340: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the costs associated with our manufacturing process development and evaluation of third-party manufacturers and suppliers; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 341: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 342: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the costs of preparing and submitting marketing approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, and the costs of maintaining marketing authorization and related regulatory compliance for any products for which we obtain marketing approval; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 343: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the costs of preparing, filing, and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property and proprietary rights, and defending intellectual property-related claims; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 344: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the costs of future activities, including product sales, medical affairs, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution, for any product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 345: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the terms of our current and any future license agreements and collaborations; and the extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates, technologies and intellectual property. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 346: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the success of our collaborations with Ionis, Genentech, DDF, AstraZeneca, Oxurion and other partners; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 347: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>our ability to establish and maintain additional collaborations on favorable terms, if at all; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 348: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the costs of operating as a public company and large accelerated filer. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nUntil such time, if ever, that we can generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, monetization transactions, government contracts or other strategic transactions. To the extent that we raise additional capital through\nthe sale of equity, ownership interests of existing holders of our ADSs and ordinary shares will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of holders of our ADSs or ordinary shares. If we raise additional funds through collaboration agreements, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, monetization transactions, or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. Future debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. Any debt or equity financing that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our shareholders. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve and has already resulted in a significant disruption of global financial markets. If the disruption persists and deepens, or if infection rates increase in areas where they have previously declined, we could experience an inability to access additional capital, which could in the future negatively affect our operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, costs and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in greater detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nCollaboration Revenues\nOur revenues are generated primarily through collaborative arrangements and license agreements with pharmaceutical companies. The terms of these arrangements may include (i) performing research and development services using our bicyclic peptide screening platform with the goal of identifying compounds for further development and commercialization, (ii) options to obtain additional research and development services or licenses for additional targets, or to optimize product candidates, upon the payment of option fees, or (iii) the transfer of intellectual property rights (licenses).\nThe terms of these arrangements typically include payment to us of one or more of the following: non-refundable upfront license fees; payments for research and development services; fees upon the exercise of options to obtain additional services or licenses; payments based upon the achievement of defined collaboration objectives; future regulatory and sales-based milestone payments; and royalties on net sales of future products.\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) or ASC 606, and all subsequent amendments. This standard applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as leases, insurance, collaboration arrangements and financial instruments.\nUnder ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.\nTo determine revenue recognition for arrangements that we determine are within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when, or as, we satisfy the performance obligations. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect substantially all of the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. As part of the accounting for these arrangements, we must make significant judgments, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each performance obligation.\nOnce a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess the goods or services promised within the contract and determine those that are performance obligations. Arrangements that include rights to additional goods or services that are exercisable at a customer's discretion are generally considered options. We assess if these options provide a material right to the customer and if so, they are considered performance obligations.\nPerformance obligations are promised goods or services in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. The promised goods or services in our contracts with customers primarily consist of license rights to our intellectual property for research and development, research and development services, and options to acquire additional research and development services or options to obtain additional licenses, such as a commercialization license for a potential product candidate. Promised goods or services are considered distinct when: (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or together with other readily available resources, and (ii) the promised good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. In assessing whether promised goods or services are distinct, we consider factors such as the stage of development of the underlying intellectual property, the capabilities of the customer to develop the intellectual property on their own and whether the required expertise is readily available. In addition, we consider whether the collaboration partner can benefit from a promise for its intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining promises, whether the value of the promise is dependent on the unsatisfied promises, whether there are other vendors that could provide the remaining promises, and whether it is separately identifiable from the remaining promises.\nWe estimate the transaction price based on the amount of consideration we expect to receive for transferring the promised goods or services in the contract. The consideration may include both fixed consideration and variable consideration. At the inception of each arrangement that includes variable consideration, we evaluate the amount of the potential payments and the likelihood that the payments will be received. We utilize either the most likely amount method or expected value method to estimate variable consideration to include in the transaction price based on which method better predicts the amount of consideration expected to be received. The amount included in the transaction price is constrained to the amount for which it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we re-evaluate the estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period of adjustment.\nAfter determining the transaction price, we allocate it to the identified performance obligations based on the estimated standalone selling prices. We must develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract. We utilize key assumptions to determine the standalone selling price, which may include other comparable transactions, pricing considered in negotiating the transaction, probabilities of technical and regulatory success and the estimated costs. Certain variable consideration is allocated specifically to one or more performance obligations in a contract when the terms of the variable consideration relate to the satisfaction of the performance obligation and the resulting amounts allocated to each performance obligation are consistent with the amounts we would expect to receive for each performance obligation.\nWe then recognize as revenue in the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over time, and if over time based on the use of an output or input method.\nLicenses of Intellectual Property: If a license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other promises or performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenue from non-refundable, upfront fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license. For licenses that are combined with other promises, such as research and development services and a research license, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. The measure of progress, and thereby periods over which revenue should be recognized, are subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of the research and development and licensing agreement.\nResearch and Development Services: The promises under our collaboration agreements may include research and development services to be performed by us on behalf of the partner. Payments or reimbursements resulting from our research and development efforts are recognized as the services are performed and presented on a gross basis because we are the principal for such efforts.\nCustomer Options: A customer's rights to choose, at its discretion, to make a payment for additional goods or services is generally considered an option. If we are not presently obligated to provide, and do not have a right to consideration for delivering additional goods or services, the item is considered an option. We evaluate customer options to obtain additional items (i.e. additional license rights) for material rights, or options to acquire additional goods or services for free or at a discount. Optional future services that reflect their standalone selling prices do not provide the customer with a material right and, therefore, are not considered performance obligations and are accounted for as separate contracts. If optional future services reflect a significant or incremental discount, they are material rights, and are accounted for as performance obligations. We allocate the transaction price to material rights based on the relative standalone selling price, which is determined based on the identified discount and the probability that the customer will exercise the option. Amounts allocated to a material right are not recognized as revenue until, at the earliest, the option is exercised or expires.\nMilestone Payments: Our collaboration agreements may include development and regulatory milestones. We evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimate the amounts to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial, and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the particular milestone in making this assessment. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee's control, such as marketing approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. At the end of each reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of such milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjusts the estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect collaboration revenue and net loss in the period of adjustment. Milestone payments that may only be achieved after the exercise of a customer option are excluded from the initial determination of the transaction price.\nRoyalties: For sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, we determine whether the sole or predominant item to which the royalties relate is a license. When the license is the sole or predominant item to which the sales-based royalty relates, we recognize revenue at the later of: (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). To date, we have not recognized any sales-based royalty revenue resulting from our collaboration agreements.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a\npre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advanced payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:\nTable 349: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>vendors in connection with performing research activities on our behalf and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 350: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>CMOs in connection with the production of preclinical and clinical trial materials; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 351: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>CROs, investigative sites or other service providers in connection with clinical trials; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 352: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>vendors in connection with preclinical and clinical development activities; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 353: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>vendors related to product manufacturing and development and distribution of preclinical and clinical supplies. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe base our expenses related to preclinical studies and clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple CMOs, research institutions and vendors that supply, conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or the amount of prepaid expenses accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and actual results could differ from our estimates. As of December 31, 2021, there have not been any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.", "item_7_truncated": "Accrued Research and Development Expenses\nTable 334: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 to 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 years to 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease commitments (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 17,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 3,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 7,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 6,484\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 55,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 6,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 42,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 6,484\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, the FDA, EMA or another regulatory authority may require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or we may experience significant trial delays due to patient enrollment or other reasons, including the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, in which case we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. For instance, all clinical sites for the Phase I/IIa trial of BT1718 being conducted by Cancer Research UK in the United Kingdom, temporarily paused enrollment of new patients due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic during the first half of 2020. The pause in enrollment was lifted in the second quarter of 2020, and patient enrollment in the Phase IIa portion of the clinical trial is again underway. However, changes in circumstances related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could result in future pauses in or other impacts on enrollment. In addition, we may obtain unexpected results from our clinical trials, and we may elect to discontinue, delay or modify clinical trials of some product candidates or focus on others. Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success.\nTable 320: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

While we have not experienced a material impact to our business, during the first half of 2020, all clinical sites for the Phase I/IIa trial of BT1718 being conducted by CRUK in the United Kingdom temporarily paused enrollment of new patients due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pause in enrollment was lifted during the second quarter of 2020 and patient enrollment in the Phase IIa portion of the clinical trial remains underway. We are also currently enrolling patients in ongoing Phase I/II clinical trials for BT5528, BT8009 and BT7480. Clinical trial sites have remained open and activities are ongoing. However, changes in circumstances related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could result in future pauses in or other impacts on enrollment. We could also see an impact on the ability to supply study drug, report trial results, or interact with regulators, ethics committees or other important agencies due to limitations in regulatory authority employee resources or otherwise. In addition, we rely on contract research organizations or other third parties to assist us with clinical trials, and we cannot guarantee that they will continue to perform their contractual duties in a timely and satisfactory manner as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. If the COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbated or persists for an extended period of time, or if additional new variants of COVID-19 emerge, we could experience significant disruptions to our clinical development timelines, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nAs a company that carries out extensive research and development activities, we seek to benefit from one of two U.K. research and development tax credit cash rebate regimes: The Small and Medium-sized Enterprises R&D Tax Credit Program, or SME Program, and the Research and Development Expenditure program, or RDEC Program. Qualifying expenditures largely comprise employment costs for research staff, consumables expenses incurred under agreements with third parties that conduct research and development, preclinical activities, clinical activities and manufacturing on our behalf and certain internal overhead costs incurred as part of research projects.\nWe anticipate that our expenses and capital requirements will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the preclinical activities and clinical trials of our product candidates and, if any product candidates are approved, pursue the commercialization of such product candidates by building internal sales and marketing capabilities.

We must develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract. We utilize key assumptions to determine the standalone selling price, which may include other comparable transactions, pricing considered in negotiating the transaction, probabilities of technical and regulatory success and the estimated costs. Certain variable consideration is allocated specifically to one or more performance obligations in a contract when the terms of the variable consideration relate to the satisfaction of the performance obligation and the resulting amounts allocated to each performance obligation are consistent with the amounts we would expect to receive for each performance obligation.\n \u25cf completing research and preclinical development of our product candidates, including conducting future clinical trials of BT5528, BT8009, BT7480 and BT1718; \n\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a novel class of medicines, which we refer to as Bicycles, for diseases that are underserved by existing therapeutics. Bicycles are fully synthetic short peptides constrained to form two loops which stabilize their structural geometry. This constraint facilitates target binding with high affinity and selectivity, making Bicycles attractive candidates for drug development. Bicycles are a unique therapeutic modality combining the pharmacology usually associated with a biologic with the manufacturing and pharmacokinetic, or PK, properties of a small molecule. The relatively large surface area presented by Bicycles allow targets to be drugged that have historically been intractable to non-biological approaches. Bicycles are excreted by the kidney rather than the liver and have shown no signs of immunogenicity to date, which we believe together support a favorable toxicological profile.\n \u25cf the success of our collaborations with Ionis, Genentech, DDF, AstraZeneca, Oxurion and other partners; \nValue Added Tax, or VAT, is broadly charged on all taxable supplies of goods and services by VAT-registered businesses. Under current rates, an amount of 20% of the value, as determined for VAT purposes, of the goods or services supplied is added to all sales invoices and is payable to HMRC. Similarly, VAT paid on purchase invoices is generally reclaimable from HMRC and is included as a component of prepaid and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n \u25cf seek to identify and develop additional product candidates; \nWe estimate the transaction price based on the amount of consideration we expect to receive for transferring the promised goods or services in the contract. The consideration may include both fixed consideration and variable consideration. At the inception of each arrangement that includes variable consideration, we evaluate the amount of the potential payments and the likelihood that the payments will be received. We utilize either the most likely amount method or expected value method to estimate variable consideration to include in the transaction price based on which method better predicts the amount of consideration expected to be received. The amount included in the transaction price is constrained to the amount for which it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we re-evaluate the estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period of adjustment.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in greater detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\n \u25cf successful enrollment in, and the initiation and completion of clinical trials; \nThe terms of these arrangements typically include payment to us of one or more of the following: non-refundable upfront license fees; payments for research and development services; fees upon the exercise of options to obtain additional services or licenses; payments based upon the achievement of defined collaboration objectives; future regulatory and sales-based milestone payments; and royalties on net sales of future products.\nAs a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, charitable and governmental grants, monetization transactions or licensing arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back, or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has already resulted in a significant disruption of global financial markets. If the disruption persists and deepens, whether as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, we could experience an inability to access additional capital.\n (1) Amounts reflect minimum payments due for our office and laboratory space leases. We have two office leases in Cambridge, U.K. under operating leases that each end in December 2026. We lease laboratory space in Lexington, Massachusetts under an operating lease that expires in December 2022. \nOther Financial and Corporate Impacts\nResearch and development expenses increased by $11.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase of $9.0 million in direct program spend, primarily associated with increased clinical program development expenses for BT8009, Bicycle TICA, and other discovery and platform related expenses, including costs of our collaboration agreements and U.K. government grant activities, an increase of $5.2 million in employee and contractor related expenses attributable to increased headcount\npre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advanced payments.

To date, we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from the sale of our American Depositary Shares, or ADSs, ordinary shares, and convertible preferred shares, proceeds received from upfront payments, research and development payments, and development milestone payments from our collaboration agreements with Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc, or Ionis, Genentech Inc., or Genentech, the Dementia Discovery Fund, or DDF, Sanofi (formerly Bioverativ Inc.), AstraZeneca AB, or AstraZeneca and Oxurion NV, or Oxurion; and borrowings pursuant to our debt facility with Hercules Capital, Inc., or Hercules. From our inception in 2009 through December 31, 2021, we have received gross proceeds of $557.6 million from the sale of ADSs, ordinary shares and convertible preferred shares, including the proceeds from our initial public offering, follow-on offering and at-the-market, or ATM, offering program; and $124.2 million of cash payments under our collaboration revenue arrangements, including $46.6 million from Ionis, $43.0 million from Genentech, $1.7 million from DDF, $10.3 million from AstraZeneca, $15.0 million from Sanofi, $6.6 million from Oxurion; and borrowings of $30.0 million pursuant to our Loan and Security Agreement, or Loan Agreement, with Hercules. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales.\nOther Expense, net\nPrior to our IPO, other expense, net consisted primarily of changes in the fair value associated with the remeasurement of the warrant liability for warrants we issued to subscribe for Series A and Series B1 convertible preferred shares. We remeasured the warrant liability at fair value at each reporting period until completion of our IPO in May 2019. Upon the completion of the IPO, the respective warrants were exercised or converted to warrants to subscribe for ordinary shares, and as such, we will not incur additional expense related to the remeasurement of the warrant liability in future periods.\nLoan Agreement\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, costs and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs for certain activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual agreements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as a prepaid expense or accrued research and development expenses. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are capitalized. The capitalized amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.\n \u25cf our ability to establish and maintain additional collaborations on favorable terms, if at all; and \nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $438.7 million.

In addition, in November 2020, we entered into a settlement and license agreement with Pepscan Systems\nUnsurrendered U.K. losses may be carried forward indefinitely to be offset against future taxable profits, subject to numerous utilization criteria and restrictions. The amount that can be offset each year is limited to \u00a35.0 million plus an incremental 50% of U.K. taxable profits. After accounting for tax credits receivable, we had accumulated tax losses for carry forward in the United Kingdom of $120.3 million and $72.0 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n (2) Amounts in the table reflect the contractually required principal, interest and the final payment under the Loan Agreement with Hercules as of December 31, 2021 \nBeyond our wholly owned oncology portfolio, we are collaborating with biopharmaceutical companies and organizations in therapeutic areas in which we believe our proprietary Bicycle screening platform can identify therapies to treat diseases with significant unmet medical need. Our partnered programs include collaborations in immuno-\n \u25cf attracting, hiring and retaining qualified personnel. \nWe have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of product candidates and programs, and because the extent to which we may enter into collaborations with third parties for development of our product candidates is unknown, we are unable to estimate the timing and amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with completing the research and development of our product candidates. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n \u25cf maintaining, protecting and expanding our portfolio of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets and know-how, as well as obtaining and maintaining regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates; \nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nOur direct external research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis and consist of costs, such as fees paid to consultants, contractors and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, in connection with our preclinical and clinical development activities. Costs incurred after a product candidate has been designated and that are directly related to the product candidate are included in direct research and development expenses for that program. Costs incurred prior to designating a product candidate are included in other discovery and platform related expense. We do not allocate employee costs, costs associated with our discovery efforts, laboratory supplies, and facilities, including depreciation or other indirect costs, to specific product development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product development programs and, as such, are not separately classified.\nThe impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations and financial results, clinical development and regulatory efforts, corporate development objectives and the value of and market for our ADSs, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence at this time, such as the ultimate duration of the pandemic, travel restrictions, quarantines, social distancing and business closure\nWe expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our general and administrative headcount to support our continued research and development and potential commercialization of our portfolio of product candidates. We also expect to incur increased expenses associated with being a public company and large accelerated filer, including costs of accounting, audit, information systems, legal, intellectual property, regulatory and tax compliance services, director and officer insurance costs and investor and public relations costs.\n \u25cf CROs, investigative sites or other service providers in connection with clinical trials; \nAs for our third-party manufacturers, distributors and other partners, we are working closely with them to manage our supply chain activities and mitigate potential disruptions to our clinical trial materials and supplies as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We currently expect to have adequate global supply of clinical trial materials and supplies to support our current clinical trial activities. If the COVID-19 pandemic persists for an extended period of time or begins to impact essential distribution systems such as FedEx and postal delivery, we could experience disruptions to our supply chain and operations, and associated delays in the manufacturing and supply of our products, which would adversely impact our ability to provide investigational product to our clinical trial sites and to generate sales of and revenues from our approved products, if approved.\nUntil such time, if ever, that we can generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, monetization transactions, government contracts or other strategic transactions. To the extent that we raise additional capital through\n \u25cf employee-related expenses including salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation expense; \n \u25cf continue our development of our product candidates, including conducting future clinical trials of BT5528, BT8009, BT7480 and BT1718; \nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase for the foreseeable future as a result of our expanded portfolio of product candidates and as we: (i) continue the clinical development and seek to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates, including BT5528, BT8009, BT7480 and BT1718; (ii) initiate clinical trials for our product candidates, including BT7455; and (iii) build our in-house process development and analytical capabilities and continue to discover and develop additional product candidates.\n Collaboration Revenues\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nInvesting Activities\nIf we obtain marketing approval for any product candidate that we identify and develop, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution to the extent that such sales, marketing, and distribution are not the responsibility of our collaboration partners.\n \u25cf hire and retain additional personnel, such as non-clinical, clinical, pharmacovigilance, quality assurance, regulatory affairs, manufacturing, distribution, legal, compliance, medical affairs, finance, commercial and scientific personnel; \nCritical Accounting Estimates\n \u25cf vendors in connection with performing research activities on our behalf and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf; \nwe will receive tiered royalties of 70% to 90% of the net revenue depending on the stage of development when the license is granted is less certain costs, as defined in the agreement). The Cancer Research UK Agreement contains additional future milestone payments upon the achievement of development, regulatory and commercial milestones, payable in cash and shares, with an aggregate total value of $50.9 million, as well as royalty payments based on a single digit percentage on net sales of products developed. The Cancer Research UK Agreement can be terminated by either party upon an insolvency event, material breach of the terms of the contract, upon a change in control involving a tobacco related entity, and in certain other specified circumstances, and includes provisions that require the repayment of costs to Cancer Research UK upon certain termination events or change in control events. The costs incurred by Cancer Research UK are recorded as a liability in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development as the payments are not based solely on the results of the research and development having future economic benefit. The liability is recorded as incremental research and development expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Upon the completion of the Phase IIa part of the clinical trial, we expect research and development expenses to increase significantly as we expect to fund the continued development of BT1718, as well as incur additional development milestone payments.\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from the sale of our ADSs, ordinary shares, and convertible preferred shares; proceeds received from upfront payments, payments for research and development services and development milestone payments pursuant to our collaboration agreements with Ionis, Genentech, DDF, AstraZeneca, Sanofi and Oxurion; and borrowings pursuant to our Loan Agreement.\nForeign currency transactions in currencies different from the functional currency of our UK entities are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange differences resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at period-end exchange rates in foreign currencies are recorded in general and administrative expense in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss. As such, our operating expenses may be impacted by future changes in exchange rates. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks\u201d for further discussion.\nOnce a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess the goods or services promised within the contract and determine those that are performance obligations. Arrangements that include rights to additional goods or services that are exercisable at a customer's discretion are generally considered options. We assess if these options provide a material right to the customer and if so, they are considered performance obligations.\n \u25cf our ability to raise capital in light of the impacts of the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic on the global financial markets; \n \u25cf whether our business will be adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which could materially affect our operations, delay our research efforts and clinical trials and cause significant disruption in the operations and business of third-party manufacturers, contract research organizations, or CROs, other service providers, and collaborators with whom we conduct business; and \nOther income (expense), net decreased by $3.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to interest expense related to our Loan Agreement, entered into in September 2020.\n \u25cf the costs of preparing and submitting marketing approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, and the costs of maintaining marketing authorization and related regulatory compliance for any products for which we obtain marketing approval; \nIn 2020, with the global spread of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we established a cross-functional task force and implemented business continuity plans designed to address and mitigate the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our employees, customers and our business. While we continue to experience limited financial and operational impacts at this time, given the global economic slowdown, the overall disruption of global healthcare systems and the other risks and uncertainties associated with the pandemic, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects could be materially adversely affected. We continue to closely monitor the ongoing COVID-19 situation as we evolve our business continuity plans and response strategy. Our laboratories in the United Kingdom and the United States remain operational. We have implemented plans that allow non-laboratory based employees to return to the office, with a focus on employee safety and optimal work environment. However, many non-laboratory based employees continue to work remotely. In light of continually changing circumstances regarding infection rates and local government recommendations, or if additional restrictions emerge as a result of COVID-19 variants, we may be required to suspend or reverse efforts to return to the office in the future.\nThe research and development tax credit received in the United Kingdom is recorded as a reduction to research and development expenses. The U.K. research and development tax credit, as described below, is fully refundable to us after surrendering tax losses and is not dependent on current or future taxable income. As a result, we have recorded the entire benefit from the U.K. research and development tax credit as a reduction to research and development expenses and is not reflected as part of the income tax provision. If, in the future, any U.K. research and development tax credits generated are needed to offset a corporate income tax liability in the United Kingdom, that portion would be recorded as a benefit within the income tax provision and any refundable portion not dependent on taxable income would continue to be recorded as a reduction to research and development expenses.\n \u25cf expand our infrastructure and facilities to accommodate our growing employee base, including adding equipment and infrastructure to support our research and development; and \n\nCollaboration Revenues\nPerformance obligations are promised goods or services in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. The promised goods or services in our contracts with customers primarily consist of license rights to our intellectual property for research and development, research and development services, and options to acquire additional research and development services or options to obtain additional licenses, such as a commercialization license for a potential product candidate. Promised goods or services are considered distinct when: (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or together with other readily available resources, and (ii) the promised good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. In assessing whether promised goods or services are distinct, we consider factors such as the stage of development of the underlying intellectual property, the capabilities of the customer to develop the intellectual property on their own and whether the required expertise is readily available. In addition, we consider whether the collaboration partner can benefit from a promise for its intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining promises, whether the value of the promise is dependent on the unsatisfied promises, whether there are other vendors that could provide the remaining promises, and whether it is separately identifiable from the remaining promises.\n \u25cf CMOs in connection with the production of preclinical and clinical trial materials; \nthe sale of equity, ownership interests of existing holders of our ADSs and ordinary shares will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of holders of our ADSs or ordinary shares. If we raise additional funds through collaboration agreements, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, monetization transactions, or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. Future debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. Any debt or equity financing that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our shareholders. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve and has already resulted in a significant disruption of global financial markets. If the disruption persists and deepens, or if infection rates increase in areas where they have previously declined, we could experience an inability to access additional capital, which could in the future negatively affect our operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts.\nRoyalties: For sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, we determine whether the sole or predominant item to which the royalties relate is a license. When the license is the sole or predominant item to which the sales-based royalty relates, we recognize revenue at the later of: (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). To date, we have not recognized any sales-based royalty revenue resulting from our collaboration agreements.\n \u25cf the development and timely delivery of commercial-grade drug formulations that can be used in our clinical trials; \nWe then recognize as revenue in the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over time, and if over time based on the use of an output or input method.\n \u25cf seek to identify and develop additional product candidates; \n \u25cf the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates; \n \u25cf develop the necessary processes, controls and manufacturing data to seek to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates and to support manufacturing of product to commercial scale; \nWe do not expect to generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates, which we expect will take many years and is subject to significant uncertainty. We have no commercial-scale manufacturing facilities of our own, and all of our manufacturing activities have been and are planned to be contracted out to third parties. Additionally, we currently utilize third-party contract research organizations, or CROs, to carry out many of our clinical development activities. If we seek to obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates from which we obtain promising results in clinical development, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses as we prepare for product sales, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution.\nU.K. research and development tax credits and government grant funding are recorded as an offset to research and development expense. See -Benefit from Income Taxes.\u201d\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and we do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales for the foreseeable future. Our revenue primarily consists of collaboration revenue under our arrangements with our collaboration partners, including amounts that are recognized related to upfront payments, milestone payments and option exercise payments, and amounts due to us for research and development services. In the future, revenue may include additional milestone payments and option exercise payments, and royalties on any net\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.\n \u25cf progress the preclinical and clinical development of BT7455 and BT7401; \n \u25cf progressing the preclinical and clinical development of BT7455 and BT7401; \nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nWe begin to separately track program expenses beginning at candidate nomination and accumulate all costs incurred to support each program to date. Through December 31, 2021, we have incurred approximately $19.7 million, $18.7 million, $14.3 million and $11.3 million of direct expenses for the development of the BT5528, BT8009, BT1718 and Bicycle TICA programs, respectively.\n \u25cf the costs associated with our manufacturing process development and evaluation of third-party manufacturers and suppliers; \nExpenses\n \u25cf acquire or in-license other products and technologies; \nFrom our inception through December 31, 2021, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We do not expect to generate significant revenue from sales of any products for several years, if at all.\n \u25cf the costs of operating as a public company and large accelerated filer. \nOur revenues are generated primarily through collaborative arrangements and license agreements with pharmaceutical companies. The terms of these arrangements may include (i) performing research and development services using our bicyclic peptide screening platform with the goal of identifying compounds for further development and commercialization, (ii) options to obtain additional research and development services or licenses for additional targets, or to optimize product candidates, upon the payment of option fees, or (iii) the transfer of intellectual property rights (licenses).\nCollaboration revenues increased by $1.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase of $4.2 million from our collaboration with Ionis entered into in July 2021 and an increase of $0.8 million from our collaboration with Genentech entered into in February 2020, offset by a $2.4 million decrease related to our collaboration with Oxurion due to a milestone achieved for the initiation of a Phase II trial of THR-149 in 2020, and a decrease of $1.3 million from our collaboration arrangement with AstraZeneca as AstraZeneca exercised its right to terminate a collaboration program, which resulted in the recognition of revenue of $1.5 million in 2020 for amounts allocated to a material right when an option expired.\n\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nLicenses of Intellectual Property: If a license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other promises or performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenue from non-refundable, upfront fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license. For licenses that are combined with other promises, such as research and development services and a research license, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. The measure of progress, and thereby periods over which revenue should be recognized, are subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of the research and development and licensing agreement.\n \u25cf vendors in connection with preclinical and clinical development activities; and \nWe have a novel and proprietary phage display screening platform which we use to identify Bicycles in an efficient manner. The platform initially displays linear peptides on the surface of engineered bacteriophages, or phages, before on-phage\u201d cyclization with a range of small molecule scaffolds which can confer differentiated physicochemical and structural properties. Our platform encodes quadrillions of potential Bicycles which can be screened to identify molecules for optimization to potential product candidates. We have used this powerful screening technology to identify our current portfolio of candidates in oncology and intend to use it in conjunction with our collaborators to seek to develop additional future candidates across a range of other disease areas.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $438.7 million. We believe that our existing cash will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least 12 months from the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could deplete our available capital resources sooner than we expect. See - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into various agreements with contract research organizations to provide clinical trial services, with contract manufacturing organizations to provide clinical trial materials, and with vendors for preclinical research studies, synthetic chemistry and other services for operating purposes. These payments are not included in the table above since the contracts are generally cancelable with advanced written notice, with a notice period of 90 days or less. From the time of notice until termination, we are contractually obligated to make certain minimum payments to the vendors, based on the timing of the notification and the exact terms of the agreement.\n \u25cf addressing any competing technological and market developments, as well as any changes in governmental regulations; \nOperating Activities\n \u25cf expand our infrastructure and facilities to accommodate our growing employee base, including adding equipment and infrastructure to support our research and development; and \n \u25cf add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our research and development programs, any future commercialization efforts and our operations as a public company. \nInterest Expense\n \u25cf hire and retain additional personnel, such as non-clinical, clinical, pharmacovigilance, quality assurance, regulatory affairs, manufacturing, distribution, legal, compliance, medical affairs, commercial and scientific personnel; \nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including share-based compensation, for personnel in our executive, finance, corporate and business development and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include professional fees for legal, patent, accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services, insurance, travel expenses and facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs.\nMilestone Payments: Our collaboration agreements may include development and regulatory milestones. We evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimate the amounts to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial, and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the particular milestone in making this assessment. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee's control, such as marketing approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. At the end of each reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of such milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjusts the estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect collaboration revenue and net loss in the period of adjustment. Milestone payments that may only be achieved after the exercise of a customer option are excluded from the initial determination of the transaction price.\nBased on criteria established by U.K. law, a portion of expenditures being carried out in relation to our pipeline research and development, clinical trials management and manufacturing development activities were eligible for the SME Program for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nFinancial Overview\nWe base our expenses related to preclinical studies and clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple CMOs, research institutions and vendors that supply, conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or the amount of prepaid expenses accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and actual results could differ from our estimates. As of December 31, 2021, there have not been any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.\nCustomer Options: A customer's rights to choose, at its discretion, to make a payment for additional goods or services is generally considered an option. If we are not presently obligated to provide, and do not have a right to consideration for delivering additional goods or services, the item is considered an option. We evaluate customer options to obtain additional items (i.e. additional license rights) for material rights, or options to acquire additional goods or services for free or at a discount. Optional future services that reflect their standalone selling prices do not provide the customer with a material right and, therefore, are not considered performance obligations and are accounted for as separate contracts. If optional future services reflect a significant or incremental discount, they are material rights, and are accounted for as performance obligations. We allocate the transaction price to material rights based on the relative standalone selling price, which is determined based on the identified discount and the probability that the customer will exercise the option. Amounts allocated to a material right are not recognized as revenue until, at the earliest, the option is exercised or expires.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $3.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase is primarily due to an increase of $3.3 million in personnel related costs attributable to increased headcount, an increase of $3.2 million in share-based compensation, and an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates in the amount of $0.2 million, as well as an increase of $1.6 million in other general and administrative costs, including insurance expense, to support operations as a public company, offset by a decrease of $5.0 million in professional and consulting fees, primarily associated with a decrease in external legal costs including $4.7 million of expense related to the settlement and license agreement with Pepscan entered into in November 2020.\n \u25cf progress the preclinical and clinical development of BT7455 and BT7401; \nLiquidity\nSupply Chain\nInterest income consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents held in operating accounts.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. Our net losses were $66.8 million, $51.0 million and $30.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $218.4 million. These losses have resulted primarily from costs incurred in connection with research and development activities and general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future.\n \u25cf continued acceptable safety profile of the drugs following approval; and \nOn September 30, 2020, or the Closing Date, we entered into the Loan Agreement with Hercules as agent, which provided for aggregate maximum borrowings of up to $40.0 million, consisting of (i) a term loan of $15.0 million, which was funded on the Closing Date, (ii) subject to customary conditions, an additional term loan of up to $15.0 million available from the Closing Date through March 15, 2021, and (iii) subject to our achievement of certain performance milestones and satisfaction of customary conditions and available until March 15, 2022, an additional term loan of $10.0 million. Borrowings under the Loan Agreement bear interest at an annual rate equal to the greater of (i) 8.85% and (ii) the prime rate of interest plus 5.60%. On March 10, 2021, or the Amendment Closing Date, we entered into the First Amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement, or First Amendment to LSA, with Hercules, in its capacity as administrative agent and collateral agent, and the lenders named in the First Amendment to LSA. Pursuant to the First Amendment to LSA, payments on borrowings under our debt facility with Hercules were interest-only until the first payment due on August 1, 2023, followed by equal monthly payments of principal and interest through October 1, 2024, or the Maturity Date. If we achieved certain performance milestones, the interest-only period could be extended, with the first principal payment due on February 1, 2024. On the Amendment Closing Date and pursuant to the terms of the First Amendment to LSA, we borrowed the additional term loan of $15.0 million that had been available from September 30, 2020 to March 15, 2021. In November 2021, the performance milestones were achieved, and the interest only period was extended until February 1, 2024, and the additional $10.0 million is available to be borrowed. We may prepay all or any portion greater than $5.0 million of the outstanding borrowings, subject to a prepayment premium equal to 2.0% of the principal amount outstanding if the prepayment occurs during the first year following the Closing Date, 1.5% of the principal amount outstanding if the prepayment occurs during the second year following the Closing Date; and 1.0% thereafter but prior to the Maturity Date. The Loan Agreement also provides for an end of term charge, payable upon maturity or the repayment of obligations under the Loan Agreement, equal to 5.0% of the principal amount repaid. In connection with the Loan Agreement, we granted Hercules a security interest in substantially all of our personal property and other assets, other than our intellectual property. In addition, the Loan Agreement contains customary affirmative and restrictive covenants and representations and warranties, including a covenant against the occurrence of a change in control (as defined in the Loan Agreement), financial reporting obligations, and certain limitations on indebtedness, liens (including a negative pledge on intellectual property and other assets), investments, distributions (including dividends), collateral, investments, transfers, mergers or acquisitions, taxes, corporate changes, and deposit accounts. The Loan Agreement also includes customary events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of covenants following any applicable cure period, the occurrence of certain events that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect\u201d as set forth in the Loan Agreement, cross acceleration to third-party indebtedness and certain events relating to bankruptcy or insolvency. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, a default interest rate of an additional 5.0% may be applied to the outstanding principal and interest payments due, and Hercules may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and take such other actions as set forth in the Loan Agreement.\n \u25cf develop the necessary processes, controls and manufacturing data to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates and to support manufacturing to commercial scale; \nWe recognize revenue in accordance with ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) or ASC 606, and all subsequent amendments. This standard applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as leases, insurance, collaboration arrangements and financial instruments.\n \u25cf the timing, receipt and terms of any marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; \nB.V. regarding our use of Pepscan's CLIPS peptide technology, which agreement provides for additional future milestone payments by us upon the achievement of development, regulatory and commercial milestones, with an aggregate total value of $92.4 million. We have not included future payments under this agreement in the table above since these obligations are contingent upon future events. As of December 31, 2021, we were unable to estimate the timing or likelihood of achieving these milestones.\nClinical Development\nResearch and Development Services: The promises under our collaboration agreements may include research and development services to be performed by us on behalf of the partner. Payments or reimbursements resulting from our research and development efforts are recognized as the services are performed and presented on a gross basis because we are the principal for such efforts.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we used $2.0 million and $1.2 million, respectively, of cash in investing activities for purchases of property and equipment, consisting primarily of laboratory equipment.\n \u25cf expenses incurred under agreements with third parties that conduct research and development, preclinical activities, clinical activities and manufacturing on our behalf; \nOther Income (Expense)\n \u25cf develop, maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; \nCapital Resources and Funding Requirements\nOur material cash requirements include expenses associated with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates and as we:\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $14.8 million as compared to $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in cash used in operations is primarily due an increase in net loss of $15.8 million as described in the Results of Operations above, offset by an increase in non-cash expenses, including share-based compensation expense, and an increase in cash provided from our collaboration arrangements in 2021 including a non-refundable upfront payments from Ionis.\n \u25cf the cost of consultants; \n \u25cf vendors related to product manufacturing and development and distribution of preclinical and clinical supplies. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $62.8 million, primarily consisting of net proceeds from our ATM program of $48.1 million and borrowings of $15.0 million under our Loan Agreement with Hercules, offset by the payment of debt issuance costs of $0.6 million.\n \u25cf the cost of lab supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing preclinical study materials and clinical trial materials; \n \u25cf add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our research and development programs, any future commercialization efforts and our operations as a public company and large accelerated filer. \nInterest expense consists primarily of interest expense for financing arrangements. On September 30, 2020, we entered into the Loan Agreement with Hercules and borrowed $15.0 million. On March 10, 2021, we entered into the First Amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement and borrowed an additional $15.0 million. Consequently, we expect interest expense to increase in future periods.\n\nTo determine revenue recognition for arrangements that we determine are within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when, or as, we satisfy the performance obligations. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect substantially all of the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. As part of the accounting for these arrangements, we must make significant judgments, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each performance obligation.\n \u25cf the terms of our current and any future license agreements and collaborations; and the extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates, technologies and intellectual property. \nOur product candidates BT5528, BT8009, and BT1718 are each a Bicycle\u00ae Toxin Conjugate, or BTCTM. These Bicycles are chemically attached to a toxin that when administered is cleaved from the Bicycle and kills the tumor cells. We are evaluating BT5528, a second-generation BTC targeting Ephrin type A receptor 2, or EphA2, in a company-sponsored Phase I/II clinical trial and BT8009, a second-generation BTC targeting Nectin-4, in a company-sponsored Phase I/II clinical trial. In addition, BT1718 is being developed to target tumors that express Membrane Type 1 matrix metalloproteinase, or MT1 MMP, and is being investigated for safety, tolerability and efficacy in an ongoing Phase I/IIa clinical trial sponsored and fully funded by the Cancer Research UK Centre for Drug Development, or Cancer Research UK. In addition, our product candidates BT7480 and BT7455, are each a Bicycle tumor-targeted immune cell agonist\u00ae, or Bicycle TICATM. A Bicycle TICA links immune cell receptor binding Bicycles to tumor antigen binding Bicycles. We are evaluating BT7480, a Bicycle TICA targeting Nectin-4 and agonizing CD137, in a company-sponsored Phase I/II clinical trial, and IND-enabling studies for BT7455, an EphA2/CD137 Bicycle TICA, are ongoing. Our discovery pipeline in oncology includes Bicycle-based systemic immune cell agonists and Bicycle TICAs.\nIn addition, the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021 and the effects that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.

This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a\nThe successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. As such, at this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of these product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from our product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing products, including the uncertainty of:\nWe are subject to corporate taxation in the United States and the United Kingdom. We have generated losses since inception and have therefore not paid United Kingdom corporation tax. The benefit from income taxes presented in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss is mainly the result of deferred tax assets benefited in the United States that do not have a valuation allowance against them because of profits that will be generated by an intercompany service agreement.\n \u25cf our ability to enroll clinical trials in a timely manner and to quickly resolve any delays or clinical holds that may be imposed on our development programs, particularly in light of the global COVID-19 pandemic; \nIn December 2016, we entered into a Clinical Trial and License Agreement with Cancer Research Technology Limited, or CRTL and Cancer Research UK, pursuant to which the Cancer Research UK Centre for Drug Development is sponsoring and funding a Phase I/IIa clinical trial for our product candidate, BT1718, in patients with advanced solid tumors. Cancer Research UK has designed and prepared and is carrying out and sponsoring the clinical trial at its own cost. Upon the completion of the Phase I/IIa clinical trial, we have the right to obtain a license to the results of the clinical trial upon the payment of a milestone, in cash and ordinary shares, with a combined value in the mid six digit dollar amount. If such license is not acquired, or if it is acquired and the license is terminated and we decide to abandon development of all products that deliver cytotoxic payloads to the MT1 target antigen, CRTL may elect to receive an assignment and exclusive license to develop and commercialize the product on a revenue sharing basis (in which case\n \u25cf establishing an appropriate safety profile with IND-enabling studies to advance our preclinical programs into clinical development; \n \u25cf establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third party manufacturers; \n \u25cf the costs of future activities, including product sales, medical affairs, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution, for any product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; \nCash Flows\nOther Income (Expense), net\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.", "item_7_text": "Accrued Research and Development Expenses\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, the FDA, EMA or another regulatory authority may require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or we may experience significant trial delays due to patient enrollment or other reasons, including the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, in which case we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. For instance, all clinical sites for the Phase I/IIa trial of BT1718 being conducted by Cancer Research UK in the United Kingdom, temporarily paused enrollment of new patients due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic during the first half of 2020. The pause in enrollment was lifted in the second quarter of 2020, and patient enrollment in the Phase IIa portion of the clinical trial is again underway. However, changes in circumstances related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could result in future pauses in or other impacts on enrollment. In addition, we may obtain unexpected results from our clinical trials, and we may elect to discontinue, delay or modify clinical trials of some product candidates or focus on others. Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years presented:\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research and development activities, including our discovery efforts, and the development of our product candidates, which include:\n \u25cf the costs of preparing, filing, and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property and proprietary rights, and defending intellectual property-related claims; \n \u25cf costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements; and \nFrom our inception in 2009 through December 31, 2021, we have received gross proceeds of $557.6 million from the sale of ADSs, ordinary shares, and convertible preferred shares, including the proceeds from our IPO and 2021 follow-on offering and from our at-the-market, or ATM, offering program; $124.2 million of cash payments under our collaboration revenue arrangements including, $46.6 million from Ionis, $43.0 million from Genentech, $1.7 million from DDF, $10.3 million from AstraZeneca, $15.0 million from Sanofi and $6.6 million from Oxurion; and $30.0 million in borrowings pursuant to our Loan Agreement.

While we have not experienced a material impact to our business, during the first half of 2020, all clinical sites for the Phase I/IIa trial of BT1718 being conducted by CRUK in the United Kingdom temporarily paused enrollment of new patients due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pause in enrollment was lifted during the second quarter of 2020 and patient enrollment in the Phase IIa portion of the clinical trial remains underway. We are also currently enrolling patients in ongoing Phase I/II clinical trials for BT5528, BT8009 and BT7480. Clinical trial sites have remained open and activities are ongoing. However, changes in circumstances related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could result in future pauses in or other impacts on enrollment. We could also see an impact on the ability to supply study drug, report trial results, or interact with regulators, ethics committees or other important agencies due to limitations in regulatory authority employee resources or otherwise. In addition, we rely on contract research organizations or other third parties to assist us with clinical trials, and we cannot guarantee that they will continue to perform their contractual duties in a timely and satisfactory manner as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. If the COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbated or persists for an extended period of time, or if additional new variants of COVID-19 emerge, we could experience significant disruptions to our clinical development timelines, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nAs a company that carries out extensive research and development activities, we seek to benefit from one of two U.K. research and development tax credit cash rebate regimes: The Small and Medium-sized Enterprises R&D Tax Credit Program, or SME Program, and the Research and Development Expenditure program, or RDEC Program. Qualifying expenditures largely comprise employment costs for research staff, consumables expenses incurred under agreements with third parties that conduct research and development, preclinical activities, clinical activities and manufacturing on our behalf and certain internal overhead costs incurred as part of research projects.\nWe anticipate that our expenses and capital requirements will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the preclinical activities and clinical trials of our product candidates and, if any product candidates are approved, pursue the commercialization of such product candidates by building internal sales and marketing capabilities. We expect that our expenses and capital requirements will increase substantially if and as we:\nYou should read this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and consolidated results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements, related notes and other financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions, contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.

We must develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract. We utilize key assumptions to determine the standalone selling price, which may include other comparable transactions, pricing considered in negotiating the transaction, probabilities of technical and regulatory success and the estimated costs. Certain variable consideration is allocated specifically to one or more performance obligations in a contract when the terms of the variable consideration relate to the satisfaction of the performance obligation and the resulting amounts allocated to each performance obligation are consistent with the amounts we would expect to receive for each performance obligation.\n \u25cf completing research and preclinical development of our product candidates, including conducting future clinical trials of BT5528, BT8009, BT7480 and BT1718; \n\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a novel class of medicines, which we refer to as Bicycles, for diseases that are underserved by existing therapeutics. Bicycles are fully synthetic short peptides constrained to form two loops which stabilize their structural geometry. This constraint facilitates target binding with high affinity and selectivity, making Bicycles attractive candidates for drug development. Bicycles are a unique therapeutic modality combining the pharmacology usually associated with a biologic with the manufacturing and pharmacokinetic, or PK, properties of a small molecule. The relatively large surface area presented by Bicycles allow targets to be drugged that have historically been intractable to non-biological approaches. Bicycles are excreted by the kidney rather than the liver and have shown no signs of immunogenicity to date, which we believe together support a favorable toxicological profile.\n \u25cf the success of our collaborations with Ionis, Genentech, DDF, AstraZeneca, Oxurion and other partners; \nValue Added Tax, or VAT, is broadly charged on all taxable supplies of goods and services by VAT-registered businesses. Under current rates, an amount of 20% of the value, as determined for VAT purposes, of the goods or services supplied is added to all sales invoices and is payable to HMRC. Similarly, VAT paid on purchase invoices is generally reclaimable from HMRC and is included as a component of prepaid and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n \u25cf seek to identify and develop additional product candidates; \nWe estimate the transaction price based on the amount of consideration we expect to receive for transferring the promised goods or services in the contract. The consideration may include both fixed consideration and variable consideration. At the inception of each arrangement that includes variable consideration, we evaluate the amount of the potential payments and the likelihood that the payments will be received. We utilize either the most likely amount method or expected value method to estimate variable consideration to include in the transaction price based on which method better predicts the amount of consideration expected to be received. The amount included in the transaction price is constrained to the amount for which it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we re-evaluate the estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period of adjustment.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in greater detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\n \u25cf successful enrollment in, and the initiation and completion of clinical trials; \nThe terms of these arrangements typically include payment to us of one or more of the following: non-refundable upfront license fees; payments for research and development services; fees upon the exercise of options to obtain additional services or licenses; payments based upon the achievement of defined collaboration objectives; future regulatory and sales-based milestone payments; and royalties on net sales of future products.\nAs a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, charitable and governmental grants, monetization transactions or licensing arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back, or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has already resulted in a significant disruption of global financial markets. If the disruption persists and deepens, whether as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, we could experience an inability to access additional capital.\n (1) Amounts reflect minimum payments due for our office and laboratory space leases. We have two office leases in Cambridge, U.K. under operating leases that each end in December 2026. We lease laboratory space in Lexington, Massachusetts under an operating lease that expires in December 2022. \nOther Financial and Corporate Impacts\nResearch and development expenses increased by $11.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase of $9.0 million in direct program spend, primarily associated with increased clinical program development expenses for BT8009, Bicycle TICA, and other discovery and platform related expenses, including costs of our collaboration agreements and U.K. government grant activities, an increase of $5.2 million in employee and contractor related expenses attributable to increased headcount\npre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advanced payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\n \u25cf the scope, progress, results, and costs of drug discovery, preclinical development, laboratory testing, and clinical trials for the product candidates we may develop; \n \u25cf seek marketing approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, if any; \n\nThe following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses for the years presented:\nFinancing Activities\nOverview\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $17.8 million as compared to $28.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in cash used in operations was primarily due to an increase in net loss of $20.4 million, as described Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of Operations\" included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on March 11, 2021, offset by an increase in non-cash expenses, including share-based compensation expense, and an increase in cash provided from our collaboration arrangements in 2020 including a non-refundable upfront payments from Genentech.\nSince our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing our Bicycle platform and our product candidates, BT5528, BT8009, BT1718, BT7480, BT7455 and BT7401, conducting research and development of our product candidates and preclinical programs, raising capital and providing general and administrative support for our operations. To date, we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from the sale of our American Depositary Shares, or ADSs, ordinary shares, and convertible preferred shares, proceeds received from upfront payments, research and development payments, and development milestone payments from our collaboration agreements with Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc, or Ionis, Genentech Inc., or Genentech, the Dementia Discovery Fund, or DDF, Sanofi (formerly Bioverativ Inc.), AstraZeneca AB, or AstraZeneca and Oxurion NV, or Oxurion; and borrowings pursuant to our debt facility with Hercules Capital, Inc., or Hercules. From our inception in 2009 through December 31, 2021, we have received gross proceeds of $557.6 million from the sale of ADSs, ordinary shares and convertible preferred shares, including the proceeds from our initial public offering, follow-on offering and at-the-market, or ATM, offering program; and $124.2 million of cash payments under our collaboration revenue arrangements, including $46.6 million from Ionis, $43.0 million from Genentech, $1.7 million from DDF, $10.3 million from AstraZeneca, $15.0 million from Sanofi, $6.6 million from Oxurion; and borrowings of $30.0 million pursuant to our Loan and Security Agreement, or Loan Agreement, with Hercules. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales.\nOther Expense, net\nPrior to our IPO, other expense, net consisted primarily of changes in the fair value associated with the remeasurement of the warrant liability for warrants we issued to subscribe for Series A and Series B1 convertible preferred shares. We remeasured the warrant liability at fair value at each reporting period until completion of our IPO in May 2019. Upon the completion of the IPO, the respective warrants were exercised or converted to warrants to subscribe for ordinary shares, and as such, we will not incur additional expense related to the remeasurement of the warrant liability in future periods.\nLoan Agreement\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, costs and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs for certain activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual agreements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as a prepaid expense or accrued research and development expenses. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are capitalized. The capitalized amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.\n \u25cf our ability to establish and maintain additional collaborations on favorable terms, if at all; and \nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $438.7 million. We expect that our existing cash will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least 12 months from the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \u25cf develop, maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; \nOur arrangements with Cancer Research UK provide for additional future milestone payments upon the achievement of development, regulatory and commercial milestones, payable in cash and shares, with an aggregate total value of $111.2 million, as well as royalty payments based on a single digit percentage on net sales of products developed. In addition, in November 2020, we entered into a settlement and license agreement with Pepscan Systems\nUnsurrendered U.K. losses may be carried forward indefinitely to be offset against future taxable profits, subject to numerous utilization criteria and restrictions. The amount that can be offset each year is limited to \u00a35.0 million plus an incremental 50% of U.K. taxable profits. After accounting for tax credits receivable, we had accumulated tax losses for carry forward in the United Kingdom of $120.3 million and $72.0 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n (2) Amounts in the table reflect the contractually required principal, interest and the final payment under the Loan Agreement with Hercules as of December 31, 2021 \nBeyond our wholly owned oncology portfolio, we are collaborating with biopharmaceutical companies and organizations in therapeutic areas in which we believe our proprietary Bicycle screening platform can identify therapies to treat diseases with significant unmet medical need. Our partnered programs include collaborations in immuno-\n \u25cf attracting, hiring and retaining qualified personnel. \nWe have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of product candidates and programs, and because the extent to which we may enter into collaborations with third parties for development of our product candidates is unknown, we are unable to estimate the timing and amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with completing the research and development of our product candidates. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n \u25cf maintaining, protecting and expanding our portfolio of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets and know-how, as well as obtaining and maintaining regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates; \nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nOur direct external research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis and consist of costs, such as fees paid to consultants, contractors and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, in connection with our preclinical and clinical development activities. Costs incurred after a product candidate has been designated and that are directly related to the product candidate are included in direct research and development expenses for that program. Costs incurred prior to designating a product candidate are included in other discovery and platform related expense. We do not allocate employee costs, costs associated with our discovery efforts, laboratory supplies, and facilities, including depreciation or other indirect costs, to specific product development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product development programs and, as such, are not separately classified.\nThe impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations and financial results, clinical development and regulatory efforts, corporate development objectives and the value of and market for our ADSs, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence at this time, such as the ultimate duration of the pandemic, travel restrictions, quarantines, social distancing and business closure\nWe expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our general and administrative headcount to support our continued research and development and potential commercialization of our portfolio of product candidates. We also expect to incur increased expenses associated with being a public company and large accelerated filer, including costs of accounting, audit, information systems, legal, intellectual property, regulatory and tax compliance services, director and officer insurance costs and investor and public relations costs.\n \u25cf CROs, investigative sites or other service providers in connection with clinical trials; \nAs for our third-party manufacturers, distributors and other partners, we are working closely with them to manage our supply chain activities and mitigate potential disruptions to our clinical trial materials and supplies as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We currently expect to have adequate global supply of clinical trial materials and supplies to support our current clinical trial activities. If the COVID-19 pandemic persists for an extended period of time or begins to impact essential distribution systems such as FedEx and postal delivery, we could experience disruptions to our supply chain and operations, and associated delays in the manufacturing and supply of our products, which would adversely impact our ability to provide investigational product to our clinical trial sites and to generate sales of and revenues from our approved products, if approved.\nUntil such time, if ever, that we can generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, monetization transactions, government contracts or other strategic transactions. To the extent that we raise additional capital through\n \u25cf employee-related expenses including salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation expense; \n \u25cf continue our development of our product candidates, including conducting future clinical trials of BT5528, BT8009, BT7480 and BT1718; \nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase for the foreseeable future as a result of our expanded portfolio of product candidates and as we: (i) continue the clinical development and seek to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates, including BT5528, BT8009, BT7480 and BT1718; (ii) initiate clinical trials for our product candidates, including BT7455; and (iii) build our in-house process development and analytical capabilities and continue to discover and develop additional product candidates.\n Collaboration Revenues\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nInvesting Activities\nIf we obtain marketing approval for any product candidate that we identify and develop, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution to the extent that such sales, marketing, and distribution are not the responsibility of our collaboration partners.\n \u25cf hire and retain additional personnel, such as non-clinical, clinical, pharmacovigilance, quality assurance, regulatory affairs, manufacturing, distribution, legal, compliance, medical affairs, finance, commercial and scientific personnel; \nCritical Accounting Estimates\n \u25cf vendors in connection with performing research activities on our behalf and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf; \nwe will receive tiered royalties of 70% to 90% of the net revenue depending on the stage of development when the license is granted is less certain costs, as defined in the agreement). The Cancer Research UK Agreement contains additional future milestone payments upon the achievement of development, regulatory and commercial milestones, payable in cash and shares, with an aggregate total value of $50.9 million, as well as royalty payments based on a single digit percentage on net sales of products developed. The Cancer Research UK Agreement can be terminated by either party upon an insolvency event, material breach of the terms of the contract, upon a change in control involving a tobacco related entity, and in certain other specified circumstances, and includes provisions that require the repayment of costs to Cancer Research UK upon certain termination events or change in control events. The costs incurred by Cancer Research UK are recorded as a liability in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development as the payments are not based solely on the results of the research and development having future economic benefit. The liability is recorded as incremental research and development expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Upon the completion of the Phase IIa part of the clinical trial, we expect research and development expenses to increase significantly as we expect to fund the continued development of BT1718, as well as incur additional development milestone payments.\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from the sale of our ADSs, ordinary shares, and convertible preferred shares; proceeds received from upfront payments, payments for research and development services and development milestone payments pursuant to our collaboration agreements with Ionis, Genentech, DDF, AstraZeneca, Sanofi and Oxurion; and borrowings pursuant to our Loan Agreement.\nForeign currency transactions in currencies different from the functional currency of our UK entities are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange differences resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at period-end exchange rates in foreign currencies are recorded in general and administrative expense in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss. As such, our operating expenses may be impacted by future changes in exchange rates. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks\u201d for further discussion.\nOnce a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess the goods or services promised within the contract and determine those that are performance obligations. Arrangements that include rights to additional goods or services that are exercisable at a customer's discretion are generally considered options. We assess if these options provide a material right to the customer and if so, they are considered performance obligations.\n \u25cf our ability to raise capital in light of the impacts of the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic on the global financial markets; \n \u25cf whether our business will be adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which could materially affect our operations, delay our research efforts and clinical trials and cause significant disruption in the operations and business of third-party manufacturers, contract research organizations, or CROs, other service providers, and collaborators with whom we conduct business; and \nOther income (expense), net decreased by $3.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to interest expense related to our Loan Agreement, entered into in September 2020.\n \u25cf the costs of preparing and submitting marketing approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, and the costs of maintaining marketing authorization and related regulatory compliance for any products for which we obtain marketing approval; \nIn 2020, with the global spread of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we established a cross-functional task force and implemented business continuity plans designed to address and mitigate the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our employees, customers and our business. While we continue to experience limited financial and operational impacts at this time, given the global economic slowdown, the overall disruption of global healthcare systems and the other risks and uncertainties associated with the pandemic, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects could be materially adversely affected. We continue to closely monitor the ongoing COVID-19 situation as we evolve our business continuity plans and response strategy. Our laboratories in the United Kingdom and the United States remain operational. We have implemented plans that allow non-laboratory based employees to return to the office, with a focus on employee safety and optimal work environment. However, many non-laboratory based employees continue to work remotely. In light of continually changing circumstances regarding infection rates and local government recommendations, or if additional restrictions emerge as a result of COVID-19 variants, we may be required to suspend or reverse efforts to return to the office in the future.\nThe research and development tax credit received in the United Kingdom is recorded as a reduction to research and development expenses. The U.K. research and development tax credit, as described below, is fully refundable to us after surrendering tax losses and is not dependent on current or future taxable income. As a result, we have recorded the entire benefit from the U.K. research and development tax credit as a reduction to research and development expenses and is not reflected as part of the income tax provision. If, in the future, any U.K. research and development tax credits generated are needed to offset a corporate income tax liability in the United Kingdom, that portion would be recorded as a benefit within the income tax provision and any refundable portion not dependent on taxable income would continue to be recorded as a reduction to research and development expenses.\n \u25cf expand our infrastructure and facilities to accommodate our growing employee base, including adding equipment and infrastructure to support our research and development; and \n\nCollaboration Revenues\nPerformance obligations are promised goods or services in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. The promised goods or services in our contracts with customers primarily consist of license rights to our intellectual property for research and development, research and development services, and options to acquire additional research and development services or options to obtain additional licenses, such as a commercialization license for a potential product candidate. Promised goods or services are considered distinct when: (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or together with other readily available resources, and (ii) the promised good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. In assessing whether promised goods or services are distinct, we consider factors such as the stage of development of the underlying intellectual property, the capabilities of the customer to develop the intellectual property on their own and whether the required expertise is readily available. In addition, we consider whether the collaboration partner can benefit from a promise for its intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining promises, whether the value of the promise is dependent on the unsatisfied promises, whether there are other vendors that could provide the remaining promises, and whether it is separately identifiable from the remaining promises.\n \u25cf CMOs in connection with the production of preclinical and clinical trial materials; \nthe sale of equity, ownership interests of existing holders of our ADSs and ordinary shares will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of holders of our ADSs or ordinary shares. If we raise additional funds through collaboration agreements, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, monetization transactions, or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. Future debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. Any debt or equity financing that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our shareholders. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve and has already resulted in a significant disruption of global financial markets. If the disruption persists and deepens, or if infection rates increase in areas where they have previously declined, we could experience an inability to access additional capital, which could in the future negatively affect our operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts.\nRoyalties: For sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, we determine whether the sole or predominant item to which the royalties relate is a license. When the license is the sole or predominant item to which the sales-based royalty relates, we recognize revenue at the later of: (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). To date, we have not recognized any sales-based royalty revenue resulting from our collaboration agreements.\n \u25cf the development and timely delivery of commercial-grade drug formulations that can be used in our clinical trials; \nWe then recognize as revenue in the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over time, and if over time based on the use of an output or input method.\n \u25cf seek to identify and develop additional product candidates; \n \u25cf the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates; \n \u25cf develop the necessary processes, controls and manufacturing data to seek to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates and to support manufacturing of product to commercial scale; \nWe do not expect to generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates, which we expect will take many years and is subject to significant uncertainty. We have no commercial-scale manufacturing facilities of our own, and all of our manufacturing activities have been and are planned to be contracted out to third parties. Additionally, we currently utilize third-party contract research organizations, or CROs, to carry out many of our clinical development activities. If we seek to obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates from which we obtain promising results in clinical development, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses as we prepare for product sales, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution.\nU.K. research and development tax credits and government grant funding are recorded as an offset to research and development expense. See -Benefit from Income Taxes.\u201d\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and we do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales for the foreseeable future. Our revenue primarily consists of collaboration revenue under our arrangements with our collaboration partners, including amounts that are recognized related to upfront payments, milestone payments and option exercise payments, and amounts due to us for research and development services. In the future, revenue may include additional milestone payments and option exercise payments, and royalties on any net\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.\n \u25cf progress the preclinical and clinical development of BT7455 and BT7401; \n \u25cf progressing the preclinical and clinical development of BT7455 and BT7401; \nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nWe begin to separately track program expenses beginning at candidate nomination and accumulate all costs incurred to support each program to date. Through December 31, 2021, we have incurred approximately $19.7 million, $18.7 million, $14.3 million and $11.3 million of direct expenses for the development of the BT5528, BT8009, BT1718 and Bicycle TICA programs, respectively.\n \u25cf the costs associated with our manufacturing process development and evaluation of third-party manufacturers and suppliers; \nExpenses\n \u25cf acquire or in-license other products and technologies; \nFrom our inception through December 31, 2021, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We do not expect to generate significant revenue from sales of any products for several years, if at all.\n \u25cf the costs of operating as a public company and large accelerated filer. \nOur revenues are generated primarily through collaborative arrangements and license agreements with pharmaceutical companies. The terms of these arrangements may include (i) performing research and development services using our bicyclic peptide screening platform with the goal of identifying compounds for further development and commercialization, (ii) options to obtain additional research and development services or licenses for additional targets, or to optimize product candidates, upon the payment of option fees, or (iii) the transfer of intellectual property rights (licenses).\nCollaboration revenues increased by $1.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase of $4.2 million from our collaboration with Ionis entered into in July 2021 and an increase of $0.8 million from our collaboration with Genentech entered into in February 2020, offset by a $2.4 million decrease related to our collaboration with Oxurion due to a milestone achieved for the initiation of a Phase II trial of THR-149 in 2020, and a decrease of $1.3 million from our collaboration arrangement with AstraZeneca as AstraZeneca exercised its right to terminate a collaboration program, which resulted in the recognition of revenue of $1.5 million in 2020 for amounts allocated to a material right when an option expired.\n\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nLicenses of Intellectual Property: If a license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other promises or performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenue from non-refundable, upfront fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license. For licenses that are combined with other promises, such as research and development services and a research license, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. The measure of progress, and thereby periods over which revenue should be recognized, are subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of the research and development and licensing agreement.\n \u25cf vendors in connection with preclinical and clinical development activities; and \nWe have a novel and proprietary phage display screening platform which we use to identify Bicycles in an efficient manner. The platform initially displays linear peptides on the surface of engineered bacteriophages, or phages, before on-phage\u201d cyclization with a range of small molecule scaffolds which can confer differentiated physicochemical and structural properties. Our platform encodes quadrillions of potential Bicycles which can be screened to identify molecules for optimization to potential product candidates. We have used this powerful screening technology to identify our current portfolio of candidates in oncology and intend to use it in conjunction with our collaborators to seek to develop additional future candidates across a range of other disease areas.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $438.7 million. We believe that our existing cash will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least 12 months from the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could deplete our available capital resources sooner than we expect. See - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into various agreements with contract research organizations to provide clinical trial services, with contract manufacturing organizations to provide clinical trial materials, and with vendors for preclinical research studies, synthetic chemistry and other services for operating purposes. These payments are not included in the table above since the contracts are generally cancelable with advanced written notice, with a notice period of 90 days or less. From the time of notice until termination, we are contractually obligated to make certain minimum payments to the vendors, based on the timing of the notification and the exact terms of the agreement.\n \u25cf addressing any competing technological and market developments, as well as any changes in governmental regulations; \nOperating Activities\n \u25cf expand our infrastructure and facilities to accommodate our growing employee base, including adding equipment and infrastructure to support our research and development; and \n \u25cf add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our research and development programs, any future commercialization efforts and our operations as a public company. \nInterest Expense\n \u25cf hire and retain additional personnel, such as non-clinical, clinical, pharmacovigilance, quality assurance, regulatory affairs, manufacturing, distribution, legal, compliance, medical affairs, commercial and scientific personnel; \nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including share-based compensation, for personnel in our executive, finance, corporate and business development and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include professional fees for legal, patent, accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services, insurance, travel expenses and facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs.\nMilestone Payments: Our collaboration agreements may include development and regulatory milestones. We evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimate the amounts to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial, and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the particular milestone in making this assessment. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee's control, such as marketing approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. At the end of each reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of such milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjusts the estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect collaboration revenue and net loss in the period of adjustment. Milestone payments that may only be achieved after the exercise of a customer option are excluded from the initial determination of the transaction price.\nBased on criteria established by U.K. law, a portion of expenditures being carried out in relation to our pipeline research and development, clinical trials management and manufacturing development activities were eligible for the SME Program for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nFinancial Overview\nWe base our expenses related to preclinical studies and clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple CMOs, research institutions and vendors that supply, conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or the amount of prepaid expenses accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and actual results could differ from our estimates. As of December 31, 2021, there have not been any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.\nCustomer Options: A customer's rights to choose, at its discretion, to make a payment for additional goods or services is generally considered an option. If we are not presently obligated to provide, and do not have a right to consideration for delivering additional goods or services, the item is considered an option. We evaluate customer options to obtain additional items (i.e. additional license rights) for material rights, or options to acquire additional goods or services for free or at a discount. Optional future services that reflect their standalone selling prices do not provide the customer with a material right and, therefore, are not considered performance obligations and are accounted for as separate contracts. If optional future services reflect a significant or incremental discount, they are material rights, and are accounted for as performance obligations. We allocate the transaction price to material rights based on the relative standalone selling price, which is determined based on the identified discount and the probability that the customer will exercise the option. Amounts allocated to a material right are not recognized as revenue until, at the earliest, the option is exercised or expires.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $3.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase is primarily due to an increase of $3.3 million in personnel related costs attributable to increased headcount, an increase of $3.2 million in share-based compensation, and an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates in the amount of $0.2 million, as well as an increase of $1.6 million in other general and administrative costs, including insurance expense, to support operations as a public company, offset by a decrease of $5.0 million in professional and consulting fees, primarily associated with a decrease in external legal costs including $4.7 million of expense related to the settlement and license agreement with Pepscan entered into in November 2020.\n \u25cf progress the preclinical and clinical development of BT7455 and BT7401; \nLiquidity\nSupply Chain\nInterest income consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents held in operating accounts.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. Our net losses were $66.8 million, $51.0 million and $30.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $218.4 million. These losses have resulted primarily from costs incurred in connection with research and development activities and general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future.\n \u25cf continued acceptable safety profile of the drugs following approval; and \nOn September 30, 2020, or the Closing Date, we entered into the Loan Agreement with Hercules as agent, which provided for aggregate maximum borrowings of up to $40.0 million, consisting of (i) a term loan of $15.0 million, which was funded on the Closing Date, (ii) subject to customary conditions, an additional term loan of up to $15.0 million available from the Closing Date through March 15, 2021, and (iii) subject to our achievement of certain performance milestones and satisfaction of customary conditions and available until March 15, 2022, an additional term loan of $10.0 million. Borrowings under the Loan Agreement bear interest at an annual rate equal to the greater of (i) 8.85% and (ii) the prime rate of interest plus 5.60%. On March 10, 2021, or the Amendment Closing Date, we entered into the First Amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement, or First Amendment to LSA, with Hercules, in its capacity as administrative agent and collateral agent, and the lenders named in the First Amendment to LSA. Pursuant to the First Amendment to LSA, payments on borrowings under our debt facility with Hercules were interest-only until the first payment due on August 1, 2023, followed by equal monthly payments of principal and interest through October 1, 2024, or the Maturity Date. If we achieved certain performance milestones, the interest-only period could be extended, with the first principal payment due on February 1, 2024. On the Amendment Closing Date and pursuant to the terms of the First Amendment to LSA, we borrowed the additional term loan of $15.0 million that had been available from September 30, 2020 to March 15, 2021. In November 2021, the performance milestones were achieved, and the interest only period was extended until February 1, 2024, and the additional $10.0 million is available to be borrowed. We may prepay all or any portion greater than $5.0 million of the outstanding borrowings, subject to a prepayment premium equal to 2.0% of the principal amount outstanding if the prepayment occurs during the first year following the Closing Date, 1.5% of the principal amount outstanding if the prepayment occurs during the second year following the Closing Date; and 1.0% thereafter but prior to the Maturity Date. The Loan Agreement also provides for an end of term charge, payable upon maturity or the repayment of obligations under the Loan Agreement, equal to 5.0% of the principal amount repaid. In connection with the Loan Agreement, we granted Hercules a security interest in substantially all of our personal property and other assets, other than our intellectual property. In addition, the Loan Agreement contains customary affirmative and restrictive covenants and representations and warranties, including a covenant against the occurrence of a change in control (as defined in the Loan Agreement), financial reporting obligations, and certain limitations on indebtedness, liens (including a negative pledge on intellectual property and other assets), investments, distributions (including dividends), collateral, investments, transfers, mergers or acquisitions, taxes, corporate changes, and deposit accounts. The Loan Agreement also includes customary events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of covenants following any applicable cure period, the occurrence of certain events that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect\u201d as set forth in the Loan Agreement, cross acceleration to third-party indebtedness and certain events relating to bankruptcy or insolvency. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, a default interest rate of an additional 5.0% may be applied to the outstanding principal and interest payments due, and Hercules may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and take such other actions as set forth in the Loan Agreement.\n \u25cf develop the necessary processes, controls and manufacturing data to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates and to support manufacturing to commercial scale; \nWe recognize revenue in accordance with ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) or ASC 606, and all subsequent amendments. This standard applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as leases, insurance, collaboration arrangements and financial instruments.\n \u25cf the timing, receipt and terms of any marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; \nB.V. regarding our use of Pepscan's CLIPS peptide technology, which agreement provides for additional future milestone payments by us upon the achievement of development, regulatory and commercial milestones, with an aggregate total value of $92.4 million. We have not included future payments under this agreement in the table above since these obligations are contingent upon future events. As of December 31, 2021, we were unable to estimate the timing or likelihood of achieving these milestones.\nClinical Development\nResearch and Development Services: The promises under our collaboration agreements may include research and development services to be performed by us on behalf of the partner. Payments or reimbursements resulting from our research and development efforts are recognized as the services are performed and presented on a gross basis because we are the principal for such efforts.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we used $2.0 million and $1.2 million, respectively, of cash in investing activities for purchases of property and equipment, consisting primarily of laboratory equipment.\n \u25cf expenses incurred under agreements with third parties that conduct research and development, preclinical activities, clinical activities and manufacturing on our behalf; \nOther Income (Expense)\n \u25cf develop, maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; \nCapital Resources and Funding Requirements\nOur material cash requirements include expenses associated with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates and as we:\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $14.8 million as compared to $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in cash used in operations is primarily due an increase in net loss of $15.8 million as described in the Results of Operations above, offset by an increase in non-cash expenses, including share-based compensation expense, and an increase in cash provided from our collaboration arrangements in 2021 including a non-refundable upfront payments from Ionis.\n \u25cf the cost of consultants; \n \u25cf vendors related to product manufacturing and development and distribution of preclinical and clinical supplies. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $62.8 million, primarily consisting of net proceeds from our ATM program of $48.1 million and borrowings of $15.0 million under our Loan Agreement with Hercules, offset by the payment of debt issuance costs of $0.6 million.\n \u25cf the cost of lab supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing preclinical study materials and clinical trial materials; \n \u25cf add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our research and development programs, any future commercialization efforts and our operations as a public company and large accelerated filer. \nInterest expense consists primarily of interest expense for financing arrangements. On September 30, 2020, we entered into the Loan Agreement with Hercules and borrowed $15.0 million. On March 10, 2021, we entered into the First Amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement and borrowed an additional $15.0 million. Consequently, we expect interest expense to increase in future periods.\n\nTo determine revenue recognition for arrangements that we determine are within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when, or as, we satisfy the performance obligations. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect substantially all of the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. As part of the accounting for these arrangements, we must make significant judgments, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each performance obligation.\n \u25cf the terms of our current and any future license agreements and collaborations; and the extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates, technologies and intellectual property. \nOur product candidates BT5528, BT8009, and BT1718 are each a Bicycle\u00ae Toxin Conjugate, or BTCTM. These Bicycles are chemically attached to a toxin that when administered is cleaved from the Bicycle and kills the tumor cells. We are evaluating BT5528, a second-generation BTC targeting Ephrin type A receptor 2, or EphA2, in a company-sponsored Phase I/II clinical trial and BT8009, a second-generation BTC targeting Nectin-4, in a company-sponsored Phase I/II clinical trial. In addition, BT1718 is being developed to target tumors that express Membrane Type 1 matrix metalloproteinase, or MT1 MMP, and is being investigated for safety, tolerability and efficacy in an ongoing Phase I/IIa clinical trial sponsored and fully funded by the Cancer Research UK Centre for Drug Development, or Cancer Research UK. In addition, our product candidates BT7480 and BT7455, are each a Bicycle tumor-targeted immune cell agonist\u00ae, or Bicycle TICATM. A Bicycle TICA links immune cell receptor binding Bicycles to tumor antigen binding Bicycles. We are evaluating BT7480, a Bicycle TICA targeting Nectin-4 and agonizing CD137, in a company-sponsored Phase I/II clinical trial, and IND-enabling studies for BT7455, an EphA2/CD137 Bicycle TICA, are ongoing. Our discovery pipeline in oncology includes Bicycle-based systemic immune cell agonists and Bicycle TICAs.\nIn addition, the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021 and the effects that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. For additional information, see Note 13. Commitments and Continencies of our consolidated financial statements.\nResults of Operations\n \u25cf acquire or in-license other products and technologies; \n \u25cf facilities, depreciation, and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, and other operating costs. \nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a\nThe successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. As such, at this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of these product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from our product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing products, including the uncertainty of:\nWe are subject to corporate taxation in the United States and the United Kingdom. We have generated losses since inception and have therefore not paid United Kingdom corporation tax. The benefit from income taxes presented in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss is mainly the result of deferred tax assets benefited in the United States that do not have a valuation allowance against them because of profits that will be generated by an intercompany service agreement.\n \u25cf our ability to enroll clinical trials in a timely manner and to quickly resolve any delays or clinical holds that may be imposed on our development programs, particularly in light of the global COVID-19 pandemic; \nIn December 2016, we entered into a Clinical Trial and License Agreement with Cancer Research Technology Limited, or CRTL and Cancer Research UK, pursuant to which the Cancer Research UK Centre for Drug Development is sponsoring and funding a Phase I/IIa clinical trial for our product candidate, BT1718, in patients with advanced solid tumors. Cancer Research UK has designed and prepared and is carrying out and sponsoring the clinical trial at its own cost. Upon the completion of the Phase I/IIa clinical trial, we have the right to obtain a license to the results of the clinical trial upon the payment of a milestone, in cash and ordinary shares, with a combined value in the mid six digit dollar amount. If such license is not acquired, or if it is acquired and the license is terminated and we decide to abandon development of all products that deliver cytotoxic payloads to the MT1 target antigen, CRTL may elect to receive an assignment and exclusive license to develop and commercialize the product on a revenue sharing basis (in which case\n \u25cf establishing an appropriate safety profile with IND-enabling studies to advance our preclinical programs into clinical development; \n \u25cf establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third party manufacturers; \n \u25cf the costs of future activities, including product sales, medical affairs, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution, for any product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; \nCash Flows\nOther Income (Expense), net\nITEM 7.

biopharmaceutical company developing novel bicyclic peptides called Bicycles for the treatment of cancer and other diseases. \n\n- The company has not generated any revenue from product sales to date and has incurred significant operating losses since inception. As of December 31, 2021, it had an accumulated deficit of $218.4 million.\n\n- Revenue primarily comes from collaboration agreements with pharmaceutical partners. In 2021, collaboration revenue was $11.7 million, an increase from $10.4 million in 2020.\n\n- R&D expenses in 2021 were $44.9 million, up from $33.1 million in 2020 due to increased clinical program expenses. G&A expenses were $32.4 million in 2021 versus $29.2 million in 2020. \n\n- Net loss in 2021 was $66.8 million compared to $51.0 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher operating expenses.\n\n- As of December 31, 2021, the company had $438.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. It believes this is sufficient to fund operating expenses and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months.\n\n- Key R&D programs include BT5528, BT8009 and BT1718. The company is evaluating them in ongoing Phase I/II clinical trials for cancer. It also has preclinical programs such as BT7480 and BT7455.\n\n- The company expects operating expenses and cash usage to increase as it advances its pipeline through clinical development, including conducting trials and preparing regulatory filings.\n\nIn summary, Bicycle is using its bicyclic peptide platform to develop novel therapeutics but is still in the early stages and not yet generating product revenue. It has funded operations through collaborations and financing activities."}
